Statistically, the Roman army. This list isn’t complete but it covers most of the major events:

__Greek victories__ 

[Heraclea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Heraclea)

[Asculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Asculum)

Sicilian Greek revolt (213 BC) - multiple small battles

[Tarentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tarentum_(212_BC))

[Capua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Capua) (212 BC)

__Roman victories__ 

[Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Syracuse_(213%E2%80%93212_BC))

[Capua (211 BC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Capua_(211_BC))

[Aous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Aous_(198_BC))

[Cynoscephalae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cynoscephalae)

[Thermopylae (191 BC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC))

[Pydna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pydna)

[Magnesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Magnesia)

[Battle of the Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Nile_(47_BC))

The first two — Heraclea and Asculum — were the only major field battles which Greek armies won against the Romans; both of those occurred in the first full-scale confrontation between Greek and Roman forces, [the invasion of Italy by Pyrrhus of Epirus in 280 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_War). Asculum is arguable more like a draw — it’s the battle from which we take the phrase “Pyrrhic victory” — in the aftermath Pyrrhus is said to have remarked “If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined.”

I added Tarentum and Capua to the “Greek” roster to flesh out the list a bit, but if you look at conventional histories both of those victories are usually ascribed to Hannibal, the Carthaginian — but in these cases local Italian Greek forces were an important part of the victory.

So, as you can see the list of victories tilts heavily Roman — 8 to 5, or if you remove Hannibal’s contributions 8 to 3. Rome defeated all of the major Greek states in a total of six different wars between 214 and 47 BC without a loss.

On the other hand, the whole “Greek vs Roman” contrast is perhaps the wrong way to look at it: In the list of Roman victories only the Syracuse, Capua, and the Nile are just “Roman victories over Greeks” — in all of the others, a significant fraction of the victorious army was also Greek. At Magnesia, in particular, the contribution of Rome’s Greek ally Eumenes of Pergamon was decisive and saved the day. Rome relied heavily on the fleets of Rhodes and Pergamon in the eastern Mediterranean, on Cretan archers, on Rhodian slingers and on Pergamene cavalry. Roman warfare was always coalition warfare, and various Greeks were prominent parts of the coalition. There was never a single, unambiguous war of “Greeks versus Romans”.
