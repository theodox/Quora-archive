This is a pretty old piece, since it’s so quasi-pictographic. The only reference I could find describes it as “one of the oldest Babylonian tablets in the world” though, strictly speaking it is probably Sumerian.



However the article above is from 1912, which is a long time in Cuneiform studies so I wouldn’t swear by it.

The transliteration in that article gives UŠ for that symbol; presumably the author thinks it’s [𒍑 for “man”](https://www.wordsense.eu/%F0%92%8D%91/). The ideogram is supposed to be an anatomical reference — perhaps Sumerian scribes did not hone in on the features that modern bathroom scribblers do (other old pictograms are more… graphic).

__𒍑__ is pretty boxy, perhaps the article uses UŠ because it kind of fits in the reconstructed sentence: in other words, UŠ could just be a scholarly guess.

There’s a better image [here](https://www.penn.museum/collections/object_images.php?irn=149567) but unfortunately it only shows the recto, the symbol in question is on the verso.
