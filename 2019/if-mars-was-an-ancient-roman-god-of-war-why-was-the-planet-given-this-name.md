The habit of associating planetary bodies with gods actually originates in Mesopotamia. “Mars” is basically a translation.

In Babylon, the planet we call Mars was their [Nergal](https://www.ancient.eu/Nergal/).

the association with Mars is basically a ‘translation’ of that. Greeks first and later Romans had the [habit of assuming that other people’s deities were local variants of their own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretatio_graeca); since Nergal presided over war and destruction he was an obvious match for the Greek Ares. Ares and Mars became fused by the same process. We call that planet after Mars because our astronomical tradition goes through Latin; in modern Greek it’s still “Aris”.
