I think these are all just examples of the long, chilly shadow of the Higher Ed Rat Race. 

It's hardly surprising that young adults are drawn to depictions of worlds in which young protagonists are pitted against each other in winner-take-all battles to the death, when that's what we've turned adolescence into. If you spend your early teens being told that your future depends on how well you do on your SATs, on racking up trophies in obscure sports, and on effectively simulating the appearance of a socially, politically, athletically and artistically engaged super-being.... well, you have no problem identifying with youngish heroes who must emit a constant stream of miraculous exploits or be crushed. The dark tone and grimly social-Darwinist underpinnings of these stories are a reflection of how thoroughly we've injected adult worries into adolescence.

Fantasies -- especially power fantasies -- are a great survival mechanism for dealing with the very stressful (and, to be frank, a ridiculously over-wrought) modern version of the teens.
