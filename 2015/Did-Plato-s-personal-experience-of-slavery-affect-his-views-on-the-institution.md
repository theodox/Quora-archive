Plato's brief stint as a slave was part of his unfortunate relationship with the ruling dynasty of Syracuse. [Dion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_of_Syracuse) of Syracuse was one of Plato's students in Athens, and his nephew [Dionysius II ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_II_of_Syracuse)was the ruler of the city.

It's not universally believed that the story of Plato's enslavement is actually true. If the [Seventh Letter of Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Letter) is genuine, the story of the slavery episode is a later dramatisation -- or, for some reason, Plato chooses not to discuss it while going over his relationship with Dion and Dionysius in detail in the letter. On the other hand, there’s nothing about the story that would have struck an 4th century observer as radically implausible: piracy, and slavery were quite common in Plato’s days and it was far from impossible for a respectable Greek from one city to end up a slave in another (although, if you were socially well connected as Plato was, the likelihood of ransom was pretty good).

Here's the story as related by Diogenes Laertius: Dionysius invited Plato to his court during one on his visits to Sicily -- but the philosopher spoke too freely to the vain and touchy tyrant (who is, incidentally, also the main character in the legend of the [sword of Damocles](http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/ciceroworkslatin/f/DamoclesSword.htm)):

[Diogenes Laertius](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D1), Plato 17:

> He made three voyages to Sicily, the first time to see the island and the craters of Etna: on this occasion Dionysius, the son of Hermocrates, being on the throne, forced him to become intimate with him. But when Plato held forth on tyranny and maintained that the interest of the ruler alone was not the best end, unless he were also pre-eminent in virtue, he offended Dionysius, who in his anger exclaimed, "You talk like an old dotard." "And you like a tyrant," rejoined Plato. [19]

> At this the tyrant grew furious and at first was bent on putting him to death; then, when he had been dissuaded from this by Dion and Aristomenes, he did not indeed go so far but handed him over to Pollis the Lacedaemonian, who had just then arrived on an embassy, with orders to sell him into slavery.

Plato was brought to Aegina, which probably reflects some kind of behind the scenes plot -- Aegina was an arch-enemy of Athens, and at that time had a law condemning any Athenian who set foot on the island to death without trial. However Plato's fame and the terrible PR consequences of executing a famous philosopher got the sentence commuted to sale as a prisoner of war. Being a wealthy and prominent person Plato was immediately ransomed (this was pretty common in antiquity: Julius Caesar, for example, was likewise captured and ransomed in his youth). So, it's not correct to imagine him working as a stable boy or a field hand during his 'time as a slave' -- he was basically a political prisoner who narrowly escaped death.

So, Plato's time as a slave didn't really give him any particular insights into to the life of slaves that he didn't know about from living in a slave society (slavery in general doesn't feature largely in his writings, though in both the _Republic_ and _Laws_ slavery is not really a prominent feature -- scholars are divided if that's because his radical plans (particularly in _Republic)_  made slavery unnecessary, or whether it seemed so natural that it needed no mention. Sometimes he tosses off asides that sound like Aristotle, who devoted much more time to claiming that slaves were naturally unsuited for freedom and self-direction -- but it's generally not a subject Plato cared about.

On the other hand, the experience did certainly inform his complex feelings about the relationship between philosophy and power. As a disciple of Socrates Plato was already very aware how dangerous it could be for a philosopher to speak his mind publicly. Many of his discussions contain a strong note of caution : important teachings may be too important to commit to paper, for example, and it may be necessary for a philosopher to hide his deepest thoughts from those in power (this is another possible explanation for the silence of the Seventh Letter on Plato's travails). This strand of Plato's thought is central to the way [Leo Strauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Strauss) and his followers read Plato.

Still, Plato also honored the nobility of Socrates as well as fearing the forces the condemned him -- though he distrusted politics intensely, Plato was haunted by the idea of seeing his philosophy enthroned in a real setting. Incredibly, Plato went _back_  to Syracuse and to the court of Dionysius, vainly endeavoring to convert the monarch to a more philosophical mode of life -- an affair which came to nothing and almost got Plato killed again as the relationship between Dionysius and Dion turned into a rebellion. [Diogenes](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D1) has other anecdotes that illustrate the tricky balance Plato tried to walk between intellectual aloofness and a burning desire to see his ideas put into practice. Dion's unsuccessful reign of virtue also illustrates some of the perils that Plato failed to imagine about the costs of reinventing society from first principles.

The story of Plato's Syracusan misadventures was dramatised very effectively in Mary Renault's [The Mask of Apollo](http://amzn.to/1Wq91g9).
