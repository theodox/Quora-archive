It's very situational: thats why the biz dev people make the big bucks. 

Before you make any money you have to make 'recoup' -- that is, you have to pay back whatever the publisher gave you to make the game, plus some percentage (probably 25-50%) over that amount to cover their risks. Once that's paid back, a 25% post-recoup would be a pretty good first time deal in the traditional console market. See [Steve Theodore's answer to If I create a moderately successful AAA game, will I become a millionaire?](https://www.quora.com/If-I-create-a-moderately-successful-AAA-game-will-I-become-a-millionaire/answer/Steve-Theodore) for a bit more on recoup and what it means.

 The details of the recoup itself, though, can be highly technical: since you have to pay back your dev budget plus some premium it matters a lot if, say, QA or user experience resources from the publisher side are charged against your budget and how they are discounted. You may also be 'paying' for advertising on the console dashboard or other marketing expenses out of pre-recoup (ie, _expensive_  money). 

The other big variable is ownership of IP: if you retain ownership of the franchise name, the characters and so on you'll almost certainly get a smaller royalty rate -- if the game is a hit you'll have a vastly better negotiating position down the road so the publishers won't give you as much up front.

For all these reasons, it's a really good idea to have a lawyer you can trust whose done a few deals before if you're in serious talks with a publisher. This is a high-stakes game that you can't learn in school.
