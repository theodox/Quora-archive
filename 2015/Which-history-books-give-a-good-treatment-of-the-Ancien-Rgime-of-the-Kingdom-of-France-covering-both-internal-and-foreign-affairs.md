[François Furet](http://François  Furet) is probably the best match for the position outlined in the question; his [Interpreting the French Revolution](http://Interpreting the French Revolution) is a key book for interpretations of the Revolution which aren't rooted n in Jacobin or Marxist categories (Furet, although a former Marxist himself, tends to see those groups as deeply intertwined). His [Revolutionary France 1770-1880](http://Revolutionary France 1770-1880) covers the run-up to and the aftermath of the Revolution in a less theoretical form.

Another really interesting look -- which influences many non-Jacobin readings of the Revolution is Alexis De Toqueville's [The Ancien Regime and the French Revolution,](http://The Ancien Regime and the French Revolution,) which argues that the Revolution was in many ways the culmination of trends that dominated 18th century France rather than a break with them.

In a very different vein, Antonia Fraser's [Love and Louis XIV](http://Love and Louis XIV) and [Marie Antoinette](http://Marie Antoinette) are both very vivid portraits of life at Versailles which are wonderfully adept at turning those starched and powdered portraits into living people. The subjects are of course all members of the elite, so these aren't representative social histories, but they are much more evocative than many more academic works and they are generally well researched.

At the other end of the social scale, [The Great Cat Massacre](http://The Great Cat Massacre) covers some surprising aspects of French society in the "Age of Enlightenment".
