It‚Äôs a pretty [fiendishly difficult writing system](https://www.quora.com/Is-cuneiform-an-alphabet/answer/Steve-Theodore), with hundreds of characters used in often very non-intuitive ways. It‚Äôs also very laborious to learn and to write. This made it vulnerable to competition from other writing systems. One in particular: [Aramaic](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aramaic-language)

Cuneiform‚Äôs heyday coincided with the dominance of the Assyrian and Babylonian empires in Mesopotamia and the Levant. Both empires fell (the Assyrians in 609 BC, the Babylonians in 539) and the elaborate infrastructure needed to teach cuneiform began to fray. But well before that Aramaic ‚Äî which is written alphabetically ‚Äî was replacing Akkadian as the common language of trade across the Near East and the Levant.

Aramaic spread at first in two ways. There was trade; Damascus was a hub of the caravan routes connecting Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean. But the Assyrians and Babylonians both practiced large-scale deportations as a matter of policy (the Jews were caught up in the same system at the end of this period). This created substantial emigr√© populations throughout Mesopotamia.

Importantly, those populations knew how to write ‚Äî _alphabetically_ . The Aramaeans got their alphabet from the Phoenicians in the early Iron Age. Like Phoenician, Aramaic had only 22 characters rather than the more than 600 different ones required in cuneiform. It was also a young script: by this era cuneiform had accumulated more than two millennia of traditions: very impressive and august but also hellaciously complex. Aramaic was a lot easier to learn and to teach. It did not demand the elaborate infrastructure of temple culture and scribal tradition that was necessary for cuneiform. It was a practical script for a practical, mercantile people ‚Äî not the mysterious and exclusive domain of priests and highly trained scribes.

_Old Aramaic, as written around the time the Assyrians began to take over Aram_ 

The Assyrians were and are famous for their matter-of-fact brutality. However they were also surprisingly open to foreign customs and ideas. So, not long after the conquest of Aram, Assyrian reliefs and records show Aramaic scribes writing with pens on scrolls alongside cuneiform scribes using styluses on clay tablets.

We also see evidence of Akkadian scribes using not-quite-fluent Aramaic alongside or in preference to their native tongue.

_This tablet from the_ _[British Museum](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1898-0216-690)_ _is quite remarkable: it‚Äôs an effort to render the Aramaic alphabet in cuneiform, in alphabetical order. It‚Äôs rather messy ‚Äî it seems to be a school exercise ‚Äî but it shows the cuneiform world reacting to the rise of alphabetic writing.

Like any bureaucracy the later Assyrian empire had both innovators and reactionaries. Clearly some people preferred Aramaic to Akkadian cuneiform, as you can see in [this snippy memo from emperor Sargon II to a bureaucrat in Babylonia](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/saa17/P237990), probably around 710 BC.

> [you wrote]: 'if it is acceptable to the king, let me write and send my messages to the king on Aram[aic] parchment sheets' ‚Äì why would you not write and send me messages in Akkadian? Really, the message which you write in it must be drawn up in this very manner ‚Äì this is a fixed regulation!

This is a helpful reminder that a ‚Äútechnology‚Äù like alphabetic writing doesn‚Äôt suddenly erase everything that came before ‚Äî an Akkadian king demanding his correspondence in formal Akkadian cuneiform is not really that different than people who would look askance at an invitation to a wedding delivered via SMS message.

Nonetheless, it was hard to hold back the tide. About 125 years after Sargon, the Persian government actually created [a streamlined, rationalized version of cuneiform](https://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=old_persian) ‚Äî almost completely phonetic and down to 36 syllabic signs and 6 logograms. But even with official support, it never gained widespread acceptance. Only one of our handful of surviving Old Persian texts was a private document; the rest are all formal inscriptions. Aramaic was the medium of daily life. Writing on papyrus or parchment with a pen is quicker, and flexible materials are easier to transport ‚Äî although clay tablets are very robust, which is why they overwhelmingly dominate our archaeological record.

Thanks to its lightweight medium, the ease of alphabetic writing, and the positive network effect that came from ever-increasing uptake Aramaic spread widely. It became ubiquitous in Mesopotamia ‚Äî In Babylon, it was the main local language adopted by deported Jews who brought it back to Judea when their exile ended in 537 BC. When the Medes and then the Persians conquered Mesopotamia in the 6th century BC they quickly added Aramaic to their polyglot approach to governance: the Persian empire governed its own homeland in Elamite cuneiform but used Aramaic as the language of governance in Egypt, the Levant, Asia Minor. Heck, the Indian emperor Ashoka [addressed his once-Persian-briefly-Greek subjects in Kandahar in bilingual Greek and Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_Bilingual_Rock_Inscription). Aramaic is the ancestor of numerous later scripts, including Hebrew and Arabic but also Syriac, Pahlavi, Kharosthi, Mongolian and Manchu.

_The triumph of Aramaic under the Persian empire: Here‚Äôs a coin from the Persian province ê°âê°áê°É, ‚ÄúYHD‚Äù ‚Äî in other words, Judaea. This is actually_ _[the oldest known ‚ÄúJewish‚Äù coin](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-museum-obtains-worlds-first-jewish-coin/)_ _(early 4th c. BC) but it was minted in Philistia. Neither the empire that authorized it, the mint the stamped it, nor the people who spent it spoke Aramaic as their first language._ 

Cuneiform didn‚Äôt disappear overnight, but after the Persian era it was increasingly relegated to highly restricted contexts. Unsurprisingly, it hung on in ritual and religious contexts. It also remained a part of the rich Mesopotamian astronomical tradition ‚Äî for an astronomer dealing in dense tabular data the combination of concision and the very sophisticated sexagesimal number system made cuneiform attractive into the Parthian era. However the complex infrastructure needed to sustain cuneiform literacy was fading out as new rulers and new religions took root in Mesopotamia.

Cuneiform had had a long and successful run as graphic superpower ‚Äî over a dozen languages were recorded in cuneiform. But Aramaic was even more fertile, spawning directly or indirectly at least 16* writing systems everywhere from Turkey to Tianjin.



_* three or more times that if you believe, as many do, that it is a grandparent of Brahmi and thus dozens of scripts in South Asia._
