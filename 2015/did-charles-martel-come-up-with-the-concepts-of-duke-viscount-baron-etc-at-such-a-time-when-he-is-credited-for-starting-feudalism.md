# Did Charles Martel come up with the concepts of duke, viscount, baron, etc. at such a time when he is credited for starting feudalism?

++ to [Tim O'Neill](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-ONeill-1)'s answer: to the extent that feudalism is a single institution it has roots that go way, way back into the later Roman empire and fallout from gradual process of assimilating barbarians into Roman society. It was not a 'system' that could be invented: it's just the sum total of many centuries worth of local adaptations to changing conditions.

In that regard it's pretty significant that core feudal' titles are in fact just Roman military titles: a Duke is a _dux_ , the chief military officer of a province; a count is a _comes_  or "companion" -- in Roman times an officer of the household cavalry who accompanied an emperor or other high ranking official. _Baron_ is a late coinage -- the origin isn't clear -- but in it's early usage it basically means 'professional soldier' or 'paid retainer'. That's the basic feudal hierarchy: A regional power broker, with his important military subordinates, and their men.

However, the details varied a lot all over Europe and were constantly being tweaked -- there was no neat pyramid of precisely understood ranks. To the extent that ever existed at all it was a 17th and 18th century effort to unify many different systems of titles and rights for purposes of diplomacy and social competition among the elites: not accidentally, the rules of precedence became increasingly baroque just around the time that hereditary landed power started losing grounds to political and economic actors outside the nobility.

To give some idea of how complex it all became: a _marquess_  (English), a _marquis_  (French) or a _markgrave (_ German) all derived their titles from _mark graf --_ the "lord of the march", an appointive Carolingian military officer in command of a frontier province. By the 13th or 14th century though this one-time military rank had evolved into a hereditary title, but its former importance assured a markgraves higher status than ordinary counts. By contrast an English _earl_  was more or less a Viking _jarl --_ a 'chieftain,' somebody who had his own armed retainers. However in the less formal political systems of northwestern Europe having your own armed men made you somebody to be reckoned with. Since you didn't depend on the Duke or the King to give you the resources to mount an army; thus earls "out-rank" counts. But -- it's messy -- in England the title survived the Norman conquest (the Normans were "French," but only a few generations removed from Vikings) while in much of Scandinavia proper it got replaced with some variant of _herzog_ - which itself is really just _army leader,_ which is to say _duke._ 

So the complex hierarchy you see on the [Royal and noble ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_and_noble_ranks) wiki page (or the table in the _Dungeons and Dragons Player's Handbook!)_ isn't a snapshot of a single system: its more like an archaeological dig though many layers of changes, local adaptations, and tweaks. And paper rank didn't necessarily mean real power: many a Duke of Burgundy was more powerful than his 'lord' the King of France. The Medici of Florence weren't even titled until the 16th century when the Florentine Republic morphed into the Duchy of Florence, even though they were the richest family on the continent. And of course the Holy Roman Emperors -- nominally the pinnacle of the whole edifice -- were more often than not unable to control their most powerful 'vassals'.

So: no, there was no 'system' of feudal ranks -- there were lots and lots of different local arrangements which evolved out of the Roman framework and which the Carolingians and Merovingians revamped for a cash-poor, highly localized time. It was improvisation all the way down: it didn't achieve the full, brittle hieratic complexity until after it had ceased to be really important.
