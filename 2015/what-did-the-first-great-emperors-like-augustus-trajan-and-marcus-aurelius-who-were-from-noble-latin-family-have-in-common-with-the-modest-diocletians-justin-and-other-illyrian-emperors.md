They were all military dictators.

Seriously.

The Julio-Claudian dynasty didn't inherit power, they seized it by leading first a military revolt against the Senate (Julius Caesar) and then a successful civil war against the nominal defenders of the old constitution, topped off with a putsch which displaced one military strongman with another. It's true they maintained a figleaf of legality -- the members of the Senatorial class they hadn't killed off were obliged to rubber stamp the proclamation that Pompey or Brutus or Marc Antony were "enemies of the Republic" -- but those proclamations were made at swords-point. The Jullii were definitely blue-blooded aristocrats -- but that was not why they came to power. 

The later soldier-emperors were merely the logical extension of that basic trend. The late-republican militarists (Marius, Sulla, Pompey) had already discovered and exploited the fatal weakness of the Roman state: the only voice that really mattered was that of the armies -- who tended to be more loyal to a charismatic general or an open purse than to the state. It only took a few generations for armies to realize that blue blood was just as easy to shed as red.

_Fides exercitum: "the trust of the army" . These probably date from the Year of 4 Emperors (67 AD). Subtler emperors (Augustus, Trajan) preferred "SC" for Senatus Consultum -- but this motto keeps cropping up into the 5th century._ 

 The pattern was clear as early as [Year of the Four Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Four_Emperors), when each of the rival claimants was backed by different sections of the army. By the end the second century the Prateorian Guard literally auctioned off the throne (to [Didius Julianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didius_Julianus), at a price of 25,000 sesterces a man) . The next century was dominated by dozens of military coups -- more than 50 "emperors" reigned in the half century leading up to Diocletian.

So while it's true that Augustus would probably have had disdain for Diocletian's accent and table manners, they could still happily talk shop about the details of running a military autocracy.
