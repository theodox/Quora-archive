# If there was no monarchy in ancient Rome, wouldn't there have been Roman "Republic"? Was the name just a "public" (no "Re" as the meaning of revival)?

The Re- in _republic_  is actually the Latin word _res,_ which covers a range of meanings from “affairs” to “things” to “wealth” or “property.” The original spelling was in fact _respublica._ 

Just as “good” in English can refer to well-being in the abstract or to possessions (“trade goods”) , _res_  covers both very abstract and very down-to-earth cases.

The most _precise_  translation is probably “commonwealth,” a word invented in the 15th century by English speakers who wanted a native word for non-monarchical government and who knew their Latin. There’s also the rival English translation “Common weal”, meaning the “public good.” These coinages capture both the collective aspect (“common”) and the hard-to-pin-down nature of _res._ 

One subtle thing that commonwealth misses, however, is that “Public” in Latin is not exactly the same as the English version. In Latin the _Populus_ was originally the city militia, the armed citizen body — not just the totality people who happened to live in Rome. This, another (clunky) way to translate _respublica_  is as “the army funds.”

All that said, in historic times the Ronans generally used _respublica_  more or less the way we use republic today — as a reference to a state which might or might not have elected representative institutions. They continued to describe their own state as a _respublica_  long after it was in point of fact a monarchy.
