There's a lot of great information - so much, in fact, that it's hard to know where to start. 

__Roman novels__ 

For starters you might get in touch with fellow-Quoran [Assaph Mehr,](https://www.quora.com/profile/Assaph-Mehr) who published [Murder In Absentia: Togas, Daggers, and Magic](http://amzn.to/1pB0AoG) just last year, set in a Roman-themed fantasy world. He'll have more practical experience than anybody. 

You might also want to check out [Lindsey Davis](http://amzn.to/1pB0GNc) and [Steven Saylor,](http://amzn.to/1WN3hhT) who both do atmospheric mystery series set in Rome. [Robert Harris'](http://amzn.to/1Skw3VW)s Roman book are generally very good as well for flavor. I'm less fond of Colleen McCullough's [Masters of Rome series ](http://amzn.to/1RCx2DW)but it does have a lot of detail to ponder.

__Research__ 

The one-stop shops are [The Oxford History of the Classical World ](http://amzn.to/1oaaYTx) and Cambridge's ["Companion" series on Rome](http://amzn.to/1pB0nBT). Unfortunately these all tend to be a bit academic and some of them are quite expensive. They may be better sought at the local library. I haven't gotten around to [SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome ](http://amzn.to/1MoQkdK)yet but I've heard good things, particularly for the non-academic reader looking for an introduction to the whole big topic.

Specifically for setting-related stuff, rather than history.

[The Social History of Rome](http://amzn.to/1UoEzaj) by [Geza Alfoldy ](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&text=Geza+Alfoldy&search-alias=books&field-author=Geza+Alfoldy&sort=relevancerank)is the biggest single-book treatment of the non-political history of Rome. [As the Romans Did: A Source Book in Roman Social History](http://amzn.to/1Sku2Jh) has a lot of original source material that might be useful inspiration. The most detailed -- but not exactly the most typical -- bit of social history is [Life in Egypt under Roman Rule](http://amzn.to/1UoFeIH): although Roman Egypt was quite different than life in Rome we have all sorts of leftover paperwork, preserved by the desert sands. 

[The Ancient City: A Study of the Religion, Laws, and Institutions of Greece and Rome ](http://amzn.to/1RCtKRg) is rather old-fashioned, but its focus on the underlying folk-religious basis of Roman / Greek society would be a great source of ideas for the fantasy side.

For the fantasy side of things: [Warfare in the Classical World: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Weapons, Warriors and Warfare in the Ancient Civilizations of Greece and Rome](http://amzn.to/1Skv8Vl) will cover the swords; for the sorcery maybe [Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds](http://amzn.to/1WN1Xvo) (a collection of original texts) would be suggestive. [The Oxford Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World](http://amzn.to/1oaaWe6) is not a bad reference for technology.

__Web resources__ 

[Livius.org](http://www.livius.org/) is more or less a Roman history online - it's a great place to look up unfamiliar people, places and institutions. [LacusCurtius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/home.html) is a great collection of Rome-related links, including both original texts and modern works (that are out of copyright and thus free). [Classics: Greek & RomanHistory](http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/research/subjectguides/classics/greek&romanhistory.htm) at the University of Colorado has good links but they are usually pretty scholarly.
