I think [Kyle](https://www.quora.com/profile/Paddy-Murray-24) got the All-Star team, but I’d add a plug for [Jan Sobieski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_III_Sobieski) the [Lion of Lechistan](http://www.ichthys.ie/18-the-lion-of-lechistan) and saviour of Christendom:

Not only did he [break the siege of Vienna](http://www.historynet.com/turning-the-ottoman-tide-john-iii-sobieski-at-vienna-1683.htm) in 1683 — by many accounts putting the final stop in the advance of the Ottoman empire — he managed to do it at the head of the famously fractious [Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth:](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0119.xml) a state which makes modern day Washington DC look like a model of rational governance and cooperative decision making. The army that won at Vienna was largely his own design, dropping traditional tactics and arms in favor of a more mobile forces with a heavier reliance on firepower.

And he gets serious style points; not only that mustache, either: Wings!
