On windows you need to right click on the title bar of the window and use 'Paste'. 

Don't use the windows shell for anything serious - it's garbage. You can replace it with something like [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/), which is a great terminal that supports cut and paste, colored text, and lots of other goodies. For python work you can use [IPython](http://ipython.org/), which is a special shell for working doing Python work and has lots of developer-friendly features, including line numbers and auto-complete
