If you accept a somewhat broad definition of “city” then [Çatalhöyük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk) should win the prize: it’s not just the oldest in Asia Minor, but one of the oldest in the world, dating back at least 9000 years.

The only reason to debate the crown is population: the place hosted a population which fluctuated between 5,000 and 10,000 — if that says “town” to you you might consider [Hattusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattusa), the capital first of the [Hatti](https://www.ancient.eu/hatti/i) and then of the Hittites.

Hattusa was founded about 7000 years ago. At its peak in the late Bronze Age the population was 40,000–50,000, though this was several millennia after the first settlement.
