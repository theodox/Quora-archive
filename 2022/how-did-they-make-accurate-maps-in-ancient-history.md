By being very patient, very clever, and maybe a bit over-optimistic.

Many of the other answers will point out, quite rightly, that most people in antiquity didn’t want or need the kind of maps we’re used to today: a satellite-style view of the earth was a rare curiosity rather than a practical tool. Besides just eyeballing things, ancient cartography almost everywhere had two basic tools: route-maps and survey grids. I’ll use Roman examples but many ancient cultures had the same tools at their disposal.

If you wanted to travel, you generally used an _itinerarium_ , a route which should major roads and their key waypoints schematically — something like a modern subway map. The most famous example is the _[Tabula Peutingeriana](https://www.euratlas.net/cartogra/peutinger/index.html)_ , a remarkably faithful medieval copy of an early-imperial map.

If you look really, really carefully you may realize that this is how the Peutingeriana shows Greece (note “Athenae” at lower right). Despite the distortions, though, it’s a good guide to the Roman road network of the early empire. here’s a modern version of the same idea, with the area above highlighted:

Many _itineraria_ were text-based rather than graphic. Some of errors in the Peutingeriana come from a editor to tried to flesh out the map with a poor quality textual source. We have quite a few “text maps” from later Roman era, [mostly used by pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land](https://www.quora.com/How-did-people-on-crusades-from-Europe-know-which-route-to-use-to-get-to-Jerusalem-Were-roads-mapped-out-or-signs-in-place-that-said-Jerusalem-this-way/answer/Steve-Theodore), but also made as [references for traders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periplus_of_the_Erythraean_Sea).

All that said, the idea of an accurate “bird’s eye” pictorial representations was not _entirely_ absent. On a local scale, where land surveyors could operate, it was not uncommon to create schematic maps that would be recognizable to us. These were particularly common for official purposes: metering water usage, for example, or tax parcels. A rare surviving example is the _[Forma Urbis Romae](https://formaurbis.stanford.edu/)_ _,_ the “shape of the city of Rome” — a survey done under Septimius Severus covering Rome at a detailed 1:240 resolution (one inch = 20 feet). The complete marble original was 18 by 13 meters!

Roman surveying was quite good, as we can see from the generally high quality of things like Roman city grid plans and the accuracy with which projects like aqueducts were laid out. Roman [centuriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centuriation) or platting was very systematic, at least in areas where intensive agriculture and the taxes that came with it were present. We still have a [Roman surveyor’s handbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Agrimensorum_Romanorum) which explains the tools and techniques involved. It was not very challenging to convert a centuriated, well surveyed landscape into a fairly accurate map. Few of these survive but the examples show that a Roman magistrate could, under the right circumstances, get a reasonably good map of a local area.

It was quite rare for anyone to attempt an accurate bird’s-eye view map on something larger than this kind of scale. The examples above have parallels in many ancient cultures, and in some places (notably, in China) it was possible to extend local survey maps to cover significant areas. However the problem of reconciling commonsensical grid data with the reality of a spherical earth meant that maps on a supra-regional scale were essentially guesstimates.

Starting a few centuries after Alexander, however, Greek mathematicians made an effort to create a rigorous mathematical framework for cartography that could transcend manual surveys. This was the foundation of modern cartography, and seems to be a unique contribution.

The most famous and successful effort to create a pictorial map on a supra-national scale was the work of the second century Alexandrian astronomer [Claudius Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy). A meticulous curator of astronomical observations, he collated Greek, Egyptian and Babylonian astronomical data along with reports from travelling merchants to create a large, detailed “database” of locations for important destinations in the known world. Major cities and geographical features were catalogued by latitude (N-S) and longitude (E-W).*

In a pre-technological era this was a complex undertaking. For the most part his latitude data aren’t terrible., since anyone can learn to use an astrolabe (almost no Greek mariners traveled south of the equator, so the complexities of finding an alternative to the pole star didn’t really bother Ptolemy). Unfortunately his longitude data was often very shaky.

The only reliable way to establish a longitude was to compare the local timings of a lunar eclipse: if Ptolemy saw the eclipse at midnight in Alexandria and his correspondent wrote him from Rome that the eclipse began at 12:40, he could tell that Rome was 10 degrees west of Alexandria.** Unfortunately for Ptolemy lunar eclipses are rare and almost no-one in antiquity reckoned time down to the minute, so Ptolemy’s longitude data includes a lot of slop. It didn’t help that there were few standardized units of measure, either: even within the Roman world different [regions had different local definitions of the conventional units.](https://www.quora.com/If-we-dont-know-whether-eratosthenes-used-an-Egyptian-stadian-or-a-Greek-one-then-being-the-Alexandrian-librarian-and-doing-the-experiment-would-indicate-Egyptian-which-made-our-circumference-14-less-making-it-only/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=224365120&share=6d4a9b1b&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer) It’s believed that Ptolemy could not reconcile conflicting units in his data, leading him to[ mis-estimate the circumference of the earth](https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/sites/default/files/Preprints/P464.pdf) and consequently to distort the layout of his data points.

Sloppy or not, this data could still be used to assemble a view of the world that was far from the simplistic, schematic maps that ordinary people relied on.

The earth, as Ptolemy and his Greek predecessors knew is a sphere. That means a simple translation of latitude and longitude numbers into X,Y coordinates a page will distort distances: In Axum, at the in the lower limits of the “known world,” one degree of longitude is around 110 km, but up north , say around Hadrian’s Wall, that same degree is only about 65 km wide. We’re so used to the familiar Mercator projection and the distortions it creates that we often don’t even realize how much it distorts the world when compared to a globe.*** Greek mathematicians long before Ptolemy understood this and they tried a variety of mathematical techniques to figure out how to project lat-long coordinates onto a sheet of papyrus in ways that preserved distances (more [here ](https://apps.lib.umn.edu/bell/map/PTO/GEO/project.html)for the curious).

The results looked something like this:

_A map done in Byzantium by the scholar Maximos Planudes around 1300, using Ptolemy’s method and data. Unsurprisingly it’s pretty good for the vicinity of the Roman empire.

This was very much an egghead’s approach to cartography: a bravura display of applied mathematics but not necessarily something a prudent ship-owner would rely on for plotting routes. In regions where a Roman-era savant could find correspondents of the sort of folks who might sit up of an evening to time a lunar eclipse, the data is pretty good. The farther you get from the Mediterranean, however the shakier the data becomes. Problems stemming from his estimate for the circumference of the earth also got worse with distance from Alexandria.

_A comparison of Ptolemy’s data with a modern map, with red lines indicating the error. As you can see, the Mediterrean isn’t bad (though North Africa is inexplicably off north-south) but ther restof the world is quite distorted._ 

Despite its flaws, this is a stunning intellectual achievement, mixing mathematical cleverness and ancient data science. Ptolemy’s data includes more than seven thousand place names, many otherwise completely unrecorded in contemporary texts, from dozens of languages — evidence of remarkable patient collation of sources. It was pretty damn good for a world without magnetic compasses, mechanical clocks, or even standard units of measure.

That said, I still would not use it to set sail across the open ocean. But then Ptolemy’s contemporaries didn’t have magnetic compasses or watches, so they would not have tried either.



_* Ptolemy didn’t invent the use of latitude and longitude; credit for that goes to_ _[Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes)_ _, more famous for his estimate of the size of the earth. In Latin, “latitude” means width and “longitude” is length; the corresponding Greek terms are πλάτος and μῆκος. Eratosthenes mentally placed east at the “top” of his frame of reference, and the name stuck: so, even though our maps put north at the top our “wide” direction is up-down on paper and our “tall” direction is left-right._ 

_** Each degree of latitude is 1/360th of the earth’s circumference, so it represents a time difference of four minutes: (60 * 24) / 360 = 4_ 

_*** Don’t hate on Mercator, or accuse it of neo-colonialism; it does it’s job, which is to make life easier for navigators well. But it’s still hella stretchy, particularly toward the poles._
