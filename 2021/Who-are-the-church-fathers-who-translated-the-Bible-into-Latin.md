There were a number of different Latin translations floating around in the 3rd and 4th centuries. The most common one is known as the [Vetus Latina](http://www.vetuslatina.org/) or “Old Latin” bible. The most famous of the VL manuscripts its the [Codex Bezae](https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-NN-00002-00041/9), a bilingual Greek-Latin edition from roughly the year 400. It’s not just one of the oldest biblical manuscripts, its one of the oldest long-form Latin manuscripts.

However we don’t have a named translator: there were multiple Latin translations with a variety of variant readings floating around: as St. Augustine said

> Translators from Hebrew into Greek can be numbered, but Latin translators by no means. For whenever, in the first ages of the faith, a Greek manuscript came into the hands of anyone who had also a little skill in both languages, he made bold to translate it forthwith.

The more famous Latin bible — the one that eventually became the standard of the medieval church — was mostly translated by Eusebius Sophronius Hieronymus, better known as [St. Jerome ](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Jerome)between 382 and 405. We call this edition the “[Vulgate](https://vulgate.org/)” because it was the “common” or “popular” edition, though it really did not become dominant until the middle ages.

You can get a sense of the context from Jerome’s letter to the Pope who commissioned his translation:

> You urge me to revise the old Latin version, and, as it were, to sit in judgment on the copies of the Scriptures which are now scattered throughout the whole world; and, inasmuch as they differ from one another, you would have me decide which of them agree with the Greek original. The labour is one of love, but at the same time both perilous and presumptuous; for in judging others I must be content to be judged by all; and how can I dare to change the language of the world in its hoary old age, and carry it back to the early days of its infancy? Is there a man, learned or unlearned, who will not, when he takes the volume into his hands, and perceives that what he reads does not suit his settled tastes, break out immediately into violent language, and call me a forger and a profane person for having the audacity to add anything to the ancient books, or to make any changes or corrections therein? Now there are two consoling reflections which enable me to bear the odium—in the first place, the command is given by you who are the supreme bishop; and secondly, even on the showing of those who revile us, readings at variance with the early copies cannot be right. For if we are to pin our faith to the Latin texts, it is for our opponents to tell us which; for there are almost as many forms of texts as there are copies. If, on the other hand, we are to glean the truth from a comparison of many, why not go back to the original Greek and correct the mistakes introduced by inaccurate translators, and the blundering alterations of confident but ignorant critics, and, further, all that has been inserted or changed by copyists more asleep than awake?

Originally Jerome intended to translate only the Gospels, but eventually he translated most of the Old Testament as well, using a mix of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek sources. He concentrated on the Hebrew Old Testament where previous Latin translators had relied on the Greek Septuagint. Although he did translate the Gospels he didn’t cover all of the rest of the New Testament or all “[deuterocanonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterocanonical_books#List_of_deuterocanonicals)” books of the Old. There’s no named individual translators for the parts which Jerome did not touch — for the most part they are from the Vetus Latina tradition.

[A lot of Jerome’s correspondence survives](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001.htm), allowing for a pretty good look at his methods and concerns and the nature of the debates among the different translators of his era. The oldest copy of Jerome’s work is a surprisingly-old manuscript from the 420’s the [Codex Sangallensis 1395](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3957).

_A page of the Codex Sangallensis 1395. It starts with John, 16:30_ __in hoc credimus quia / a deo existi__  _and the thirdline is_ ___respondit eis Iesus modo creditis.___ _This very old manuscript is several hundred years earlier than the invention of capitalization and the widespread use of punctuation._
