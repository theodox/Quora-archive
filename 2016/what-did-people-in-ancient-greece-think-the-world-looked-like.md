“Ancient Greece” covers a lot of time, so the answer has to be kind of handy-wavey.

In general they knew the world was round — that was pretty standard by around the 5th century BC. The idea was old enough in most of Greek antiquity that there’s no one inventor or discoverer: some candidates include the mathematician-philosopher Pythagoras and the poet Hesiod. The sphericity of the was commonly accepted from the time of Aristotle (around 350 BC)

They generally divided the world into 3 main landmasses: Europe, Asia, and Africa. The dividing line between Europe and Asia was the Hellespont (they knew that Europe and Asia were also connected by land, and they argued about which rivers emptying into the Black Sea might be the dividing line. The line between Asia and Africa was more or less the frontier of Egypt.

Around all of this there was probably ‘ocean’: the open sea. Generally the Greeks believed that the Atlantic and Indian oceans were connected; they had heard stories of Phoenician navigators circumnavigating Africa from Egypt around to Morocco via the Cape of Good Hope but they were skeptical about them. This also tied in with the idea in Homer (~800 BC) that the outer boundary of the known world was a circular river — his name for it, _Okeanos_ , is the origin of our “ocean”.

It’s not bad given what they had to work with, but the the distances get less and less accurate away from the mediterranean._ 

They were very aware of the difference in climate that came with latitude. They knew that things got colder as you went north and hotter as you went south. There was a lively debate about whether you could actually reach the southern hemisphere: some argued that the heat at the equator was too deadly. However they knew that in theory the [antipodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes) would be as habitable and temperate as home. The first Greek to record things like frozen seas and the midnight sun was [Pytheas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pytheas), an explorer who visited Northern Europe.

One of the big puzzles was the legend of “Hyperborea” — the country _beyond_  the north, which was thought to be warm and sunny. I like the theory of [Avram Davidson](http://amzn.to/1W6sirx): the paradox arose from the amber trade. Greeks got their amber by trade with northern Europe, particularly the Baltic region. They knew that region was cold — but they also recognized that the amber was related to tree sap, and that the insects trapped inside were tropical insects. Most Greeks, however, regarded this as a legend.

By 240 BC they had a [very good estimation of Earth's circumference](http://www.windows2universe.org/citizen_science/myw/w2u_eratosthenes_calc_earth_size.html), based on the work of the mathematician Eratosthenes. Many centuries later, when the professionals laughed at Columbus, it wasn’t because they thought the world was flat: Columbus botched the math and his estimate of the distances was much smaller than the accepted figure for the size of the earth, which at that point had been well known for more than 1,000 years.
