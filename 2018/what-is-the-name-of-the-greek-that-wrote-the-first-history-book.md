We usually say [Herodotus of Halicarnassus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus), the “father of history.”

Sometimes people will make a case for his predecessor, [Hecataeus of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecataeus_of_Miletus), but since Hecataeus’ work survives only in bits and pieces, that’s guesswork on our part.
