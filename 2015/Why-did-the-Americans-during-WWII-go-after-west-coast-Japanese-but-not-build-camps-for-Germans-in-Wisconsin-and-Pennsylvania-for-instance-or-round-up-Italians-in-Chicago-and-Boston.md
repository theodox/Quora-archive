# Why did the Americans during WWII go after west coast Japanese, but not build camps for Germans in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, for instance (or round up Italians in Chicago and Boston)?

There has been pretty substantial animus towards Germans in the US during the first World War as well. German "diplomat" [Arthur Zimmermann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Zimmermann) had warned the American attache in 1916 that in the event of war, half a million German immigrants in the US would rise up to defend the fatherland (the attache replied that in that event, the US had well over half a million lamp-posts from which to hang them). During the war there were [ routine harrassments and even lynchings](http://www.authentichistory.com/1914-1920/2-homefront/4-hysteria/) of German Americans. 

Some of this is routine wartime xenophobia, but it was also linked to a general perception of underhanded "dirty" tactics on the part of the Germans: the use of submarines to sink neutral shipping without warning was regarded as little short of terrorism, and the publication of the [Zimmermann Telegram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmermann_Telegram) which showed that the Germans had been working to provoke Mexico and Japan into attacking the US generated tremendous outrage. 

In addition to the racism and xenophobia of the early days of the war the Japanese interment also reflected the perception that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was equally dishonorable. Even Hitler, the thinking went, had the decency to declare war before attacking (some Japanese historians maintain to this day that the Japanese declaration was supposed to arrive in Washington before the bombs arrived in Hawaii, but this has never been proven).

As a side note: My grandfather was in the shore patrol as an undercover agent during the Second World War. His job was to watch for Axis agents trying to discover convoy dates. His notes show that he spent most of his time in bars owned by Germans and Italians, and that he kept detailed track of their conversations. One I particularly recall stated: _Owner described Mussolini as "not bad guy" and "misunderstood",_  and in the margin was a pencil note saying _increase surveillance._
