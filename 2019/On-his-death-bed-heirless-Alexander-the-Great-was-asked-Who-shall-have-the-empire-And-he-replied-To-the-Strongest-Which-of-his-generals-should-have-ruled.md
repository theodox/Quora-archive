There has always been a school of thought which claimed that what Alexander actually said on his death bed was not that his power should go _kratistoi,_ “to the strongest” but _Krateroi,_ “to [Krateros](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/craterus/)”.

Krateros was one of Alexander’s ablest generals and had — at least for most of the 320’s — been one of those Alexander trusted with sensitive political missions as well. Evidence of his status is the fact that when Alexander organized his [mass wedding of Macedonians with Persian women](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/arrian/anabasis/the-weddings-in-susa/), only Alexander himself, Hephaistion and Krateros married princesses of the Persian royal house.

Krateros was also supposed to be one of two regents for Alexander’s unborn child — but when Alexander died, Krateros was far away from events: he was leading a draft of veterans home to Macedonia, where he was slated to become Alexander’s viceroy. By the time news reached him the other regent, [Perdiccas,](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/perdiccas/) had already established his own power base and Krateros was maneuvered into a secondary position. Krateros rebelled against Perdiccas in 321, but the next year he died in battle against Alexander’s Greek secretary [Eumenes](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/eumenes/). It’s a measure of Krateros’ popularity with the troops that Eumenes had to lie to his own men about whom they were fighting — he was convinced that Macedonian troops, even in the midst of a civil war, would not willingly fight against Krateros. In the end it was not a Macedonian, but a Thracian who killed Krateros on the field.

If Krateros had still been in Babylon when Alexander died, there’s at least a slight chance that he could have held the empire together — whether as regent for Alexander’s son or or in his own name. He was both more popular with the Macedonians and a better field commander than Perdiccas (who lost his life the same year in a disastrous campaign against Ptolemy in Egypt). However the fortunes of war (and the cleverness of Eumenes, who was the wiliest though not the most powerful of the successors) decreed that it was not to be.

Out of the rest, subsequent events suggest that either [Ptolemy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter)or [Antigonus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigonus_I_Monophthalmus)would have been the best choices: they were, respectively, the wisest and the most militarily successful of the Diadochoi.

Ptolemy seems to have foreseen the breakup of Alexander’s empire earlier than any of the other Diadochoi, and wisely chose to position himself in Egypt: an wealthy and an eminently defensible corner of the world where he could establish himself without exhausting his army and his treasury in the pursuit of absolute power. It’s not an accident that Ptolemy’s kingdom was was the first of the successor states to achieve independence and the last to lose it.

Antigonus was a Macedonian’s Macedonian: a rough and ready bear of a soldier, relentless and cunning on the field and off. He put together the largest and most powerful of the first-generation successor states:

Unfortunately for Antigonus, his central position was almost as much of a liability as a strength, and he ended up fighting all of the other Successors. His vast holdings fell apart within a couple of years. Seleucus popped up behind his back, taking control of Babylon and eventually the entire east while Antigonus was fighting in the west. Antigonus had one able lieutenant in his son, [Demetrius Poliorcetes](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/demetrius-poliorcetes/), but he never was able to delegate important fights to other commanders and so could not manage a multi-front war.

In any case, none of the Diadochs was ideally suited for the throne, which had been in the Argead family for almost four hundred years. Despite the endless, dreary record of treachery in the wars of succession the ordinary soldiers retained a powerful attachment to the dynasty — so strong that they were willing to put Alexander’s mentally impaired brother [Arrhidaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_III_of_Macedon) on the throne, despite his obvious unfitness to rule. The chaotic history of the years 325–280 suggests that none of the Successors was really fit to wear Alexander’s mantle — none of them could match his unique combination of battlefield genius, messianic charisma, and inherited legitimacy. That’s why his empire didn’t outlive him.
