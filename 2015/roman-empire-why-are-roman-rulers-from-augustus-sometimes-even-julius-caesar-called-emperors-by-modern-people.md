Roman tradition -- the patriotic narratives at the heart of Roman cultural identity -- was intensely hostile to hereditary monarchy; the Republic arose out of the overthrow of a corrupt monarchy and freedom from overbearing sovereigns was something Romans felt distinguished themselves from their slavish and degraded neighbors. _Rex,_ "King", was anathema to them (it was never the title of a Roman emperor in Latin, unless you count Charlemagne as a Roman emperor). Augustus, raised as a traditional Roman aristocrat, shared that prejudice even though he was also a successful and unchallengeable military despot; it's to his credit (and the good luck of the Roman people) that he had the sense to act like something other than the monarch he really was. Modern historians refer to the early empire, in which that fiction was maintained with a more or less straight face, as the __[principate](http://principate)__  because the 'emperor' pretended to be nothing more than the _princeps senatus_  -- the old Republican term for the most respected statesaman in the Senate.

His successors, alas, were not as good at keeping the mask on. For more than 150 years the emperors walked a fine line between the reality of absolute power and some vestigial sense of shame about that reality. Emperors -- even pretty nasty ones like [Domitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domitian) -- stuck with impressive but vague title like Imperator instead of the more accurate _dominus_ (the word a slave would use for his master) or the off-limits _rex._ Flatterers and hangers on were less subtle - Nero's fans called his song-book (the one he allegedly sang from while Rome burned) the 'liber dominicis' or the Master's Book. Throughout this period a flgleaf of Republican institutions remained, but the charade was hollower with every passing reign.

When the Augustan system crumbled in the [fratricidal crisis of the third Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century) the old restraints -- which reflected the outlook of Rome's aristocracy and its collective Republican memory -- finally fell apart. By the mid 3rd century the emperors were not aristocrats but successful military leaders, rarely of Roman extraction and unfettered by any memories of Republican tradition. [Diocletian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian) was the first to use the bombastic title of _Dominus et Deus,_ Lord and God, and from him the empire of the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries is often known as the __[dominate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominate)__ , in contrast to the [principate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principate) of Augustus. After Constantine the emperors dropped the _Deus_  but still ruled frankly and unapologetically as autocrats.

As for the modern terminology: it's a good use of English. Although it's derived from _Imperator_ , we are using it as a generic not a specifically Roman title. An emperor is, strictly speaking, a [king of kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Kings) -- his subjects are not just individuals but whole nations. Every Roman emperor deserved that title on technical grounds, since much of the Roman world was actually ruled by client kings -- from petty chieftains in Britain or the Balkans to cultured Hellenistic kings like [Juba of Mauretania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II) to important regional power brokers like the biblical [Herod ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_the_Great)or [Zenobia of Palmyra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenobia).
