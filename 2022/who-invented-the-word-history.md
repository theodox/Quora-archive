The English word ultimately originates with the Greek word __ἱστορία__ , _historia,_ which means an “inquiry” or an “investigation” — it’s just [the verb for “inquire”](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=i%28%2Fstoria&la=greek#lexicon) turned into a noun.

Often etymologies are based on guesswork, but we know exactly where this comes from: the[ opening sentence of the works of the Greek historian Herodotus:](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D0)

> Ἡροδότου Ἁλικαρνησσέος __ἱστορίης__ ἀπόδεξις ἥδε, ὡς μήτε τὰ γενόμενα ἐξ ἀνθρώπων τῷ χρόνῳ ἐξίτηλα γένηται…

> Here is the display of the __inquiry__  of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that things done by man not be forgotten in time….

[Herodotus is widely known as the “father of history](https://www.livescience.com/who-was-herodotus).” Although people had been recording events for thousands of years he is the first person were are sure made a systematic effort to understand and record past events. He didn’t just write down traditional stories: he travelled, he spoke to many different informants, and he collated different kinds of evidence and even invited the audience to choose among irreconcilable versions when he could not reach a conclusion. His description of his own work as __ἱστορία__ was picked up by other writers who followed his example: Aristotle, only a century later, [seems to take it as a given that “ἱστορία” is how you refer to a study of the past.](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1451a)

The Romans took the Greek word ἱστορία and turned it into the Latin _historia,_ from whence it passed into most European languages. [It was the Roman author Cicero who dubbed Herodotus “father of history”](https://topostext.org/work/752#1.4).

_I was going to illustrate this with a nice antique-y looking bust of Herodotus. Google Image Search evidently had other ideas about where I was going. This is why I am not eager for the singularity to arrive._
