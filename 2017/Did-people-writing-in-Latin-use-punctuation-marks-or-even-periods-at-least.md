In general no: solid blocks of text were the rule. They did use a mark like our period to indicate abbreviations, to which they were extremely prone:

That’s M[arcus] AGRIPPA L[ucii] F[ilius] CO[n]S[ul] TERTIUM FECIT. Note the dots in between the abbreviated words.

For special purposes they also used some diacritical marks —the [apex ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_(diacritic))was basically what we’d call an accute accent; the macron marked a long vowel and the circumflex a short, just as they still do in your dictionary. These weren’t common in ordinary use but they show up, for example, in bilingual texts designed to help Greek speakers learn Latin.
