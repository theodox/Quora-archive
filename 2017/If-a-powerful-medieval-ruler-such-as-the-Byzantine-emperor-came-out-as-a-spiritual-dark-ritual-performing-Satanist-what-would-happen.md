# If a powerful medieval ruler, such as the Byzantine emperor, came out as a (spiritual, dark ritual performing) Satanist, what would happen?

There were plenty of _accusations_ of that sort of thing. In a medieval context an accusation of Satanism would play the same role as an accusation of Communism in the 50’s, of Rightism during the Cultural Revolution, or even of racism today, in that it need not be true to be a serious problem — and, for that reason, it’s a powerful rhetorical temptation.

Here, for example is [Pope Silvester II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sylvester_II) one of the several popes accused of commerce with the devil:

Sylvester was probably the most successful self-made man of the middle ages; born a peasant he ended up pope and he was a renowned polymath who introduced Arabic numerals into Europe. But as a friend and ally of Holy Roman Emperor [Otto III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) he was also deeply unpopular in Italy and ended up driven out of Rome by his political enemies. The story that he was in league with Satan was spread, not entirely by coincidence, in the political pamphlets of his enemies.*

The truly classic case of Satanism as a political catspaw is [that of the Knights Templar](http://www.dummies.com/education/politics-government/king-phillip-iv-pope-clement-v-and-the-fall-of-the-knights-templar-part-ii/). They were a rich and powerful crusading order. So rich, in fact, that the king of France, [Philip IV, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_IV_of_France)decided that all that wealth and power needed to reallocated in the interest of fairness: an appealing project if your surname is _Philip the Fair._ 

Philip had the entire Templar hierarchy in France arrested in a single night, and then produced a series of sensational “confessions” under torture which claimed to show that the Templars were idolaters and heretics. The most famous accusation was that the Templars worshipped [Baphomet, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet)and idol in the form of a three-faced head, a dead cat, or a human skull.

_Philip (left, in Blue) superintends the burning of Templars_ 

Like a Soviet show trial this fulfilled the formal function of justifying the actions against the Templars but — like a soviet show trial — it was not very widely believed. Most of the Templars were pardoned after their confessions — but the Templars who renounced the extorted confessions were burned at the stake. They were, however, were popularly regarded as martyrs by ordinary Frenchmen.

There were a few cases where what seems to us like serious mental illness did get put down as diabolism. The most famous cases are those of [Gilles de Rais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_de_Rais) in France and [Elizabeth Báthory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_B%C3%A1thory) in Hungary, both of whom seem to have been prolific serial killers.** De Rais was executed for murder (he was not executed for diabolism, having confessed and received pardon on that account). Bathory, however, died after four years under house arrest — her influential friends was able to spare her the death penalty although her accomplices were executed.

_Gilles de Rais (in red) led to the gallows_ 

——
* More precisely, of the enemies of his successors; the story originates with [Beno of Santi Martino e Silvestro, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beno_of_Santi_Martino_e_Silvestro)who used it as “evidence” for charges of necromancy and devil worship against [Gregory VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_VII)

**There’s a modern movement to exonerate de Rais, but its primary case seems to be that his conviction was advantageous to pro-English party in that Hundred Years War era setting. You can read the [The Trial of Gilles De Rais](http://amzn.to/2i1S0Rx), which includes the transcripts of the trial, and decide for yourself.
