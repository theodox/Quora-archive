# Why is there a gap of hundreds of years, from the end of ancient Greek to the beginning of Arab texts, without any mention of the pyramids?

There are quite a few mentions, starting with Herodotus in the 5th century BC.

__4th century BC__ 

The pyramids were on the list of the “[Seven Wonders of the World”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_the_World) that emerged from Alexandria — this became the basis of many tourist itineraries in the Greek and Roman period.

__1st century BC__ 

Diodorus of Sicily, a historian of the early Roman empire, includes a[ long discussion of the pyramids](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1C*.html) in his history.

__1st century AD__ 

The geographer [Strabo](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17A3*.html) and the natural historian [Pliny](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D36%3Achapter%3D16) both discuss the pyramids.

__3rd century__ 

The Roman collector of curiosities [Gaius Julius Solinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Solinus) discussed the pyramids (his account shows that in this period their original limestone covering was still intact) — his work, incidentally, continued to circulate in Latin during the Middle Ages.

__4th century__ 

[Ammianus Marcellinus](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ammianus_22_book22.htm) mentions the Pyramids, and the optical effect discussed by Solinus.

There’s also a throwaway line in a sermon of [St. Gregory of Nazianzen](https://books.google.com/books?id=WzkIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT414&lpg=PT414&dq=nazianzen+pyramid&source=bl&ots=XEJBIt-pY3&sig=w-pCNEI7Dh1MT32S2j8yqd0fMLc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3vOb6qfTYAhVRPN8KHW8hBbIQ6AEIQTAH#v=onepage&q=nazianzen%20pyramid&f=false), in the context of “wonders” like the old list.

__6th century__ 

There’s a passing reference (just illustrating an idea) in the [John Philoponus’ commentary on Aristotle’s Physics](https://books.google.com/books?id=GQIsAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=philoponus+aristotle+pyramid&source=bl&ots=mMiN6zgqFt&sig=IP93r5jl7Mb55fw-bdwGLjbpucY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwim6JSap_TYAhUD_mMKHScYDwAQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&q=philoponus%20aristotle%20pyramid&f=false).

I’d be surprised it there were no Arabic mentions; there’s definitely one in the 9th century by the Syrian Orthodox patriarch [Dionysius I Telmaharoyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_I_Telmaharoyo).
