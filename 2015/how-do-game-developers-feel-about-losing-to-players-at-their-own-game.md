As several other answers point out - it's great. It's like watching your baby graduating from college.

Although that brief period when you have several months of concentrated practice and the rest of the internet has only just installed your game.... well, that's awesome too in a somewhat different way. It's sure the only time I ever show up on the leaderboards.
