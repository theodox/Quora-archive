You can get the whole sad saga in [What were the sackings of Rome in the year 410 by the Goths and Vandals like? Were they organized or did they just ride through the city slashing, burning and pillaging?](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging) But I'll offer a basic recap here.

In a word, the politics were incredibly convoluted. Larger issues of nationality, culture, law and religion were much less important in this period than a bewildering kaleidoscope of alliances and rivalries between powerful dynasts of both Roman and non-Roman origin. The boundaries between "Roman" and "Barbarian" where much complex than we usually imagine. The whole Roman empire, but particularly in the western half, had long been very adept at assimilating foreign elements -- in many ways Rome's ability to incorporate foreigners is the key to its success, going as far back as the the foundation of the Latin League and stretching forward to the fact that the last "Romans" were, in fact, Greeks) . 

To give some flavor: the highest ranking military officer in the west on the eve of the Gothic invasion was [Stilicho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho) - the son of a Vandal. [Alaric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_I), who sacked Rome in 410, had been a military subordinate of Stilicho at the [Battle of the Frigidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Frigidus) in 394 -- but within a year the were fighting against each other in Greece as part of a long, complex and treacherous intrigue between the Goths and factions within both the eastern and western Roman courts.

_Empress Aelia Eudoxia (her father was a Frank, as well as a Roman General) and her husband, the feckless Emperor Arcadius._ 

This pattern of shifting alliances and betrayals became the norm for several generations. In the mid 400's the generalissimo of the east would be [Aspar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspar), half-Alan and half Gothic -- eventually assassinated by an emperor he himself had placed on the throne. The most successful "Roman" ruler of Italy in the 6th century was [Theoderic](http://Theoderic), king of the Ostrogoths but also Roman consul and _magister militum_  -- who earned the title by defeating [Odoacer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer), another Germanic general / Roman patrician.

_Theoderic the Ostrogoth - but also a Roman. Note Romulus and Remus!_ 

So that's the real background to the Visigothic invasion of Italy: it was just one act in a much longer, more involved soap opera between which numerous feuding warlords -- nominally "Roman" or of other nationalities, but distinguished primarily by their ability to mobilize troops and survive in a treacherous, shifting political landscape. The period looks more like the fragmented and chaotic China of the 1920's and 30's than the stereotype of embattled Romans overwhelmed by foreign hordes.

With regards to details:

Alaric's sack of Rome in 410 was immediately preceded by a classic power-political move of the period. He basically demanded a payoff not to attack and Stilicho arranged a suitable bribe and a cluster of impressive Roman titles to go with it. This seems to have part of a deal with Alaric to cooperate in joint effort to wrest the province of Illyricum away from the eastern Empire, while simultaneously trying to checkmate the Roman usurper [Constantine III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_III_(western_emperor)).* 


 Stilicho's political enemies had him deposed and executed in 408, and then repudiated the deal with Alaric. They also organized a massacre of Germanic troops in Roman garrisons across Italy. It's not clear if this reflected race-hatred or was done on the theory that these troops were loyal to Stilicho - but in any event the survivors flocked to Alaric, swelling his army while depleting the Roman ranks. Even then, he was willing to cut a deal: he besieged Rome 3 separate times in 408, 409, and 410. He accepted payments and offered terms -- and also bullied the Senate into anointing a puppet emperor as a bargaining chip. However the prior emperor -- the useless [Honorius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorius_(emperor)) -- would neither fight nor bargain and Alaric eventually took the city in 410.

_Honorius, the loser emperor. He doesn't deserve this much screen space._ 


* for even more flair: When Constantines' revolt was put down, a second mutiny started in Gaul -- only to be put down by Alaric's Visigothic successor (and yes, Roman general too) [Ataulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataulf) .
