The theory is based on the example of Athens, where the one-time king became the _[archon basileus](http://www.agathe.gr/democracy/state_religion.html)_ , the “magistrate-king,” who was responsible for the ritual duties that had once belonged to the king. In the _[Constitution of the Athenians](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.%20Ath.%20Pol.%203&lang=original)_ __ Aristotle tells us that the King’s office was the oldest. It was first split into two, with the Polemarch (“war leader”) being created “because some kings proved cowardly in war.” In the time of Codrus — traditionally, the late 11th century BC — the office split again with the basileus retaining ritual and judicial duties and the political leadership passing to a single life-archon. Eventually in the democratic era, just before the Persian war, the choice of king-archon was done by lot just as with all the other Athenian offices.

Even in the classical era the Athenian basileus retained some very archaic ritual duties: most famously, he had to play the part of Dionysus and enact a public “divine wedding” with his wife during the [Anthesteria](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Anthesteria). This naturally tends to suggest that the survival of the office in Athens was due to religious conservatism: politics may have passed the king by, but it wasn’t wise to alter the age-old rituals which were supposed to belong only to royalty.

Given what we know about Roman religious conservatism, the analogy seems quite clear: as at Athens, the end of a political monarchy was papered over in the religious sphere with the provision of a magistrate, ritually distinct from the rest of the population, who could maintain the traditional rites.

However it’s worth noting that this process isn’t actually recorded in a Roman source — it’s inferred from the Athenian version. Even a late-Republican source might not clear things up, since it would be entirely possible for an antiquarian like Varro to see the events of the early Republic through an Athenian lens. Plutarch gives us a version in his [Roman Questions](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0211%3Asection%3D63) that certainly sounds like Aristotle:

> when [ancient kings] did not practise moderation, but were arrogant and oppressive, most of the Greek states took away their authority, and left to them only the offering of sacrifice to the gods; but the Romans expelled their kings altogether, and to offer the sacrifices they appointed another, whom they did not allow to hold office or to address the people, so that in their sacred rites only they might seem to be subject to a king, and to tolerate a kingship only on the gods' account.

This seems to imply a repeating pattern. We know a similar office existed in a number of other Italian cities. Combined with the persistence of “royalty” with priestly duties but no political power in other Greek cities (the [Bacchiads ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchiadae)in Corinth, the [Battiads ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonax_(lawmaker))of Cyrene), the “de-politicization” of the monarchy in Rome seems like a pretty solid hypothesis. In this view this evolution is a common feature of Mediterranean city-state institutions as they grow from chiefdoms into aristocratic republics and eventually territorial states.

An alternative theory is laid out in [this paper](https://www.academia.edu/2441396), which argues that the _rex_ was always a priest and never a civil or military king. This has the virtue of simplicity — however the ancient sources are pretty unanimous in depicting the Roman kings (even the saintly Numa) as political-military leaders.
