Autodesk has long been notorious for using fairly high-spec video cards as a standard — this has regarded as a dodge for saying “well, that’s an unsupported video card so we can’t give you support for that bug.”

You may run into problems if you use the ‘viewport 2.0’ settings in your 3d window— if you have display issues try the ‘legacy viewport’ instead. Otherwise it should be fine, though a bit slow.
