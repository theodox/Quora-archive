When a gladiator was freed and allowed to retire, he was given the _rudis_  or wooden sword which marked the formal end of his career in the arena: a retired gladiator was therefore called a _rudiarius._ The _rudis_ was both the mark of his freedom and his honor as a victor.

_The stick in the hand of the referee (center) is also called a_ rudis,_since most referees in gladiatorial fights were themselves retired gladiators_ 

__Fun fact__ : thanks to the internet, you can [buy a rudis as a retirement gift](https://www.reliks.com/functional-swords/history/the-rudis-sword-of-freedom/), if the symbolism appeals to you.
