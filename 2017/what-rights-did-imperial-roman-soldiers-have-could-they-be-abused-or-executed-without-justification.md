In theory, citizens could not be executed or put to torture except for treason, and a proper trial could only be held at Rome.

However serving soldiers were a different story: Roman army discipline was harsh. Swearing the soldiers’ oath or _sacramentum_  meant explicitly surrendering the citizen’s immunity to corporal and capital punishment as well as promising obedience to orders.

For small-scale infractions — petty theft, failure to do fatigue duty, or drunkenness — a soldier was liable to be flogged. This could be fairly mild, the _castigatio_  administered by a centurion’s staff — or very severe, a _flagellatio_  with a barbed whip. For the most serious offenses, though, the punishment could be very harsh. Theft of military supplies could lead to the loss of hand. The most serious punishment of all was the _[fustuarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fustuarium)_ _,_ in which the condemned soldier was beaten to death with cudgels by his messmates.

We don’t know a lot about Roman court martial procedures, but it’s a safe bet that the rules were not overly delicate. They have left one mark on our language, however: our “tribunal” comes from the dais in a Roman military camp where the [tribunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tribune) — the officers in charge of discipline — issued their judgements. It appears that the tribunes generally discussed important cases as a body, and there was presumably a series of customs which shaped the administration of routine matters.

On the other hand a commander could act summarily with no formal procedures or legal advice. Tacitus for example tells how the [strict general Corbulo had a soldier executed for leaving his sword behind while digging ditches.](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D18) He remarks “We may be sure that he was strict and implacable to serious offences, when such sternness in regard to trifles could be believed of him.”. On the other hand Corbulo’s discipline was a reaction against lax management by earlier commanders in the same unit — an indication of how much leeway individual commanders had. Roman historians loved to record stories of novel or striking punishments meted out by commanders: individual tastes seem to have mattered more than bureaucratic procedures, at least for the kinds of cases we hear about.

Roman military justice could be, quite literally, random: there are also several recorded instances of [decimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimation_(Roman_army)), the process of executing every 10th man, chosen by lot, from a unit which had disgraced itself in the field. Decimation was however very rare: more often a unit which had displeased its commander would be put on poor rations, assigned to extra work, or in extreme cases broken up and dispersed among other forces: a severe punishment given the religious veneration that Roman soldiers had for their legions.

As the imperial period wore on there was some erosion of the traditional Roman military discipline. The legions dominated Roman politics, and they expected favoritism from the commanders whom they helped to become emperors. There were a number of cases in the third and fourth centuries of mutinous troops killing their own commanders (usually, it should be noted, during the many civil wars of that period: mutiny in the face of external enemies was still uncommon).
