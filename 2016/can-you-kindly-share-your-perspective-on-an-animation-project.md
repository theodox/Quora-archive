You might want to try uploading a video to YouTube and then linking it here — otherwise there's not much we can do to help on the animation side.

For a first 3D project, though, it looks like a great start. The modeling is particularly good for a first time project.

Here's a couple of things I think could use some extra help :

1. The lighting appears to shift between the two shots; there's a shadow casting light somewhere behind the fan in the first image, but it looks like it has moved to the right of the laptop in the second (did you animate it around to provide rim light?) . It is[ fine to “cheat” ](http://www.deakinsonline.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?t=3011)with lights that don't really belong in the physical environment. They can help pick out details or make the important parts of the scene stand out from the background. However as soon as they become too obvious they will be distracting. It's especially true if the accent lights cast shadows — moving highlights will draw attention but moving shadows can be even harder to ignore!

2. You should also think about indirect lighting. The shadowed light coming in the door seems fairly sharp — in the “real world” it would have to be a small single bulb light to cast such a crisp shadow; it doesn't feel like light from the sun or sky. Direct sun would be stronger and would produce a lot of bounce light in the room; sky like would be softer and produce soft shadows (the light would probably also be bluer). Area lights are better than point lights — and the window and door will have similar strength.

3. Overall you should think about how much or how little you want the foreground — the desk, the laptop, and especially the character — to stand out from the rest of the scene. The interior walls are I the same general value (light-dark) range as the desk and the character. This makes the laptop, which is quite a bit brighter, steal a lot of the attention in the scene. If that's not what you are trying to focus on, you might want to think about using a different set of colors for the walls and floors, so the character stands out more clearly.

I think you could probably help both (2) and (3) by adding more indirect light with some [ambient occlusion](http://blog.digitaltutors.com/understanding-ambient-occlusion/). That would lighten up the scene overall while making the backdrop softer and less distracting. It helps a lot to make a 3D scene have depth — the main problem is that it takes a long time to render.

Hope that is all helpful— as I said, this is very good for a first project. Keep it up!
