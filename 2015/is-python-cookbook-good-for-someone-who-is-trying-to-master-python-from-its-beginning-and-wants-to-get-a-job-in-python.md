Cookbook is a great book if you're looking for some basic, hands-on introduction to the 'standard library' (Doug Hellman's [Python Module of the Week](http://pymotw.com/2/) website is a great online resource for the same thing) but it's not a systematic introduction.

For getting started, I like [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://amzn.to/1IWNqKA). Once you're comfortable with the syntax and mindset, [Effective](http://amzn.to/1Tn5rVx) Python is a great way to see the real beauty of the language beyond just syntax.
