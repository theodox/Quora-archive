# During the Macedonian-Roman wars, why did Philip V create the general conscription decree (see link) in Greek if the peasant Macedonians were non-Greek? How would they understand what to do if they couldn't read the decree which was in Greek?

If you look at the picture carefully, the piece has got to be [SEG 49:722](https://epigraphy.packhum.org/text/312699) (Full Greek text is in the link).

This particular decree is unlikely to be aimed at peasants of any kind.

Line 3 says that horses approved for service will be bought in for 1,000 drachmae, a very substantial amount of money : three year’s wages for a skilled laborer. Line 11 implies recruitment exclusively from those with citizen rights (ἐκ τῶν κατακεχωρισμένων ἐν τοῖς πολιτεύμασι). This presumably meant full citizens of Kassandreia, the city where the decree was posted or, if this was copied to other cities, to the local social elite. Most cities in Macedonian kingdoms (in Greece and elsewhere) had limited citizen rolls based on property qualifications.

Lines 17–19 says that the conscripts will be enrolled in the _[agema of the Macedonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agema)_ _—_ which originally__ meant an elite cavalry corps, or into the _[hypaspsists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypaspists)_ _—_ which originally referred to an elite infantry unit_._ The oldest men (45+) are to be enrolled as “peltasts” — which in earlier times meant skirmishers but at this point appears to mean something else, perhaps just “infantry”. [Specialists don’t really agree about the organization of Philip’s army.](http://file:///C:/Users/steve/Downloads/A01.030.0.pdf) However taken together the presence of the agema, cavalry, and hypapsists suggests that the recruiting here is intended to staff elite units, not to sweep up all available manpower. The best modern student of this period, Miltiades Hatzopoulos, thinks the high property qualification for service in the Macedonian army was a major limiting factor in Philip’s recruitment efforts (same link as above, p 105–6).

In any event this is still clearly aimed, in Greek, at Macedonians in Kassandreia. The restoration reads “categorized into the agema of the Macedonians” (line 17), and traditionally hypaspists were recruited from the upper classes of ethnic Macedonians. Starting with Philip II, all Macedonian government business is recorded in Greek — first in Attic and later in Koine. There’s no question that this assumes a bunch of Greek-speaking Macedonians as an audience. Of course it’s still poor evidence for the usual subject of Greek/Macedonian arguments, since it’s dated to 197 or so: it tells little about the linguistic conditions in Macedonia in the 350s. Kassandreia was an empty ruin in Alexander’s day: his father destroyed the previous settlement of Potidaea, which was at that time an Athenian colony, right around the time of Alexander’s birth. It was rebuilt and repopulated by Cassander about fifty years later.
