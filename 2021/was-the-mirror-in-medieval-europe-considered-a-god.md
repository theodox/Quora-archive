Mirrors were old, old news. And medieval people weren’t fools who could be flummoxed by shiny objects.

Mirror — at first, made of polished copper — were used in most of western Europe as far back as the Chalcolithic (Copper) age, maybe 4500 BC or thereabouts. By about 2500 years ago, pretty good reflections could be gotten by using bronze with an extra high tin content. Glass mirrors first appeared in the Roman era, but they were always expensive: they really only became popular in the later middle ages, when Flemish glass blowers learned how to reliably make large glass sheets. Obsidian, shiny volcanic glass, was also used for larger wall-mounted mirrors, and sometimes semiprecious stones were used as colored mirrors.

So, mirrors were hardly a piece of forgotten high technology in the middle ages. Isidore of Seville’s _Etymologies_ , a standard encyclopedia from roughly 600 - 1200, mentions several different materials used for mirrors: different semiprecious stones, metals, and glass. He also defines _speculum_ , “mirror” like this:

> Mirrors (speculum) are what women use to look at their faces. A mirror is so named either because the reflection is produced from its brightness (splendor) or because women looking in it study the appearance (species) of their face and add whatever ornament they see is lacking.

Here’s an example of a medieval mirror with a silver face in a bronze backing. Originally this piece had two folding parts, like a modern makeup compact; you can see the hinge at the top.
