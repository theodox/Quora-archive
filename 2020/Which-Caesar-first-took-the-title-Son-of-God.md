None of them used that title exactly. Augustus— the first emperor— used _divi filius,_ which is more like “son of the sainted.”__ He was referring to the fact that he was the (adopted) son of Julius Caesar, who many Romans believed to have been a superhuman figure. A proper god is a _deus_ , but a _divus_ like _divus Julius is_ a deceased mortal who is believed to have merited a special kind of afterlife for his deeds on earth.Other emperors who wanted to associate themselves with a revered predecessor used the same tiyke, it’s often seen as _DF_ on coins.

Later emperors of a more megalomaniacal bent did occasionally use the title of _deus_ directly, but this was an aberration in the first century (Caligula flirted with it and Domitian’s experimentation with it was held as a black mark against him). It was more common at the end of the 3d century but disappeared again after Constantine in the early 4th.
