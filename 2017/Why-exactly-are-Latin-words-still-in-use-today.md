For all but the last hundred years or so, any educated English person had at least some Latin as a [routine part of their education](https://www.quora.com/In-the-traditional-British-public-school-system-why-is-or-was-it-believed-that-knowledge-of-the-classics-was-necessary) — in fact, before the last half of the 19th century nobody would take you seriously as an educated person if you weren’t very well versed in Latin.

Not surprisingly, English speakers who were trying to “upgrade” their language continually returned to Latin for borrowings that could expand the language: there were a lot of concepts you met in Latin for which there was simply no neat single word in English.

A good example is the history of the word _quality._  Nowadays we use it as a synonym for _value_  or _worth,_ but the word’s origin is actually in ancient philosophy. It literally means “which-ness”, the property that makes something the thing it is rather than something else. There’s no easy word in English to convey that somewhat abstract idea , but Latin provides a ready-made single word — a word, moreover, that the kind of people who might want to discuss which-ness in English probably all knew from reading Latin. So _quality_ it is, from _qualitas ._ 

The irony is that the Latin word itself is made out of _qualis_  (“which”) and a suffix that makes an abstract noun — because the Romans had the exact same problem a millennium or two earlier. They were just starting to get interested in philosophy and they wanted a word to represent the Greek [ποιότης](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=poio%2Fths&la=greek&can=poio%2Fths0&prior=qu%C4%81l%C4%ADtas);, which means the same thing. However, being Romans, they copied the formation of the word — which also means “which-ness” — using Latin roots instead of taking the whole thing.

Every language borrows from others. Sometimes you absorb words in one go — the way we take _quality_ or the way the Romans borrowed _philosophia_  from the Greeks_._ Sometimes you recreate them, the way Latin made up “quality” to match a Greek idea. And in the 18th and 19th century, when increasing technology changes brought about a lot of new ideas and new products it was easy for a Latin-soaked culture to put together hybrid words like _thermometer_ from words for “temperature” and “measure”.

Once those words become entrenched, though, they aren’t Latin any more. _Paludamentum_  — a soldier’s cloak — is Latin. But _quality_ and the thousands of other Latinate borrowings in English are English words that just happen to have a Latin pedigree. Some stand out — most people know that one _referendum_ becomes many _referenda,_ “because Latin” — but most of them are invisible because they are so familiar.

Nowadays, of course, we don’t need Latin if we don’t want it . English is a magpie language, we happily steal everything from _aardvark_  to _zen._ But after a long period of coexistence Latin still forms a part of our mental toolkit — that’s why you see so many horrendous bland corporate monikers emerging from Google Translate-driven board meetings.



To illustrate the point here’s a list of the words in this piece that are Latin derived, either directly or from Norman French. I’ve probably missed a couple.
