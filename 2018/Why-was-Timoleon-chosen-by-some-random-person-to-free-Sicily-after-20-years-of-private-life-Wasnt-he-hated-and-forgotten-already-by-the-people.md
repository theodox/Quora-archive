# Why was Timoleon chosen by some random person to free Sicily after 20 years of private life? Wasn't he hated and forgotten already by the people?

[Timoleon ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Timoleon*.html)was something of a problem back home in Corinth. He was a representative of a wealthy and powerful clan, a war hero, and a political hero who had saved his city from an aspiring tyrant.

Unfortunately, the tyrant he killed was his own brother.

So, for the Corinthians he was a difficult figure to place: was he truly the civic-minded hero that Plutarch presents? Or, was the killing just a falling out between two rivals from a dangerously powerful house which was still a threat to the city?

In Plutarch’s account, this tragic choice between personal and political loyalties sent him into a tailspin. He even attempted to starve himself to death — this may have been a deliberate suicide attempt, or perhaps it is simply the closest a Greek writer could come to describing a deep depression. He gave up politics and lived a life of seclusion and exile for most of the next twenty years.

Since Plutarch is our only good source (and because Plutarch is such a deft hand with his narrative choices) it’s easy to see this as a true Greek tragedy. On the other hand, it’s also easy to imagine that less exalted considerations might have rendered that exile less than completely voluntary. Even after he freed Syracuse and the other Sicilian cities from their tyrants, Timoleon was accused of plotting to seize a kingdom for himself. In the cutthroat world of Greek politics, at least some of Timoleon’s fellow citizens might have seen him as a party to his brother’s crimes, rather than a righteous avenger.

Shipping Timoleon off to Sicily was thus an idea that had many attractions. Syracuse was wealthy enough to rival Athens and Corinth; it commanded the sea-routes to the western world. A grateful Syracuse would be a valuable ally. Corinthian prestige demanded that the tie between the mother city and her colonies be respected.* And, for any Corinthians who suspected that the very wealthy former war-hero was a would-be tyrant, sending him off to the west to liberate the Syracusans looks like a good deal. At the very least, it removes him from the domestic political scene. If the expeditions fails, he’s either dead or has lost his reputation. If it succeeds, Corinth has a valuable friend.

It might be worth noting, in this context, how laughably small Timoleon’s original force actually was: seven ships and 700 mercenaries — when the Carthaginians tried to stop Timoleon in Sicily they brought ten times that many.

In the event, it seems the Corinthians chose wisely: Timoleon worked miracles with his tiny force, despite the backstabbing politics of Sicily. So it’s also possible people simply saw a genius with no application for his talents.

_A coin of Timoleon, and possibly a portrait as well. The legend is “Zeus Eleutherios”, “Zeus the Liberator” — an epithet that before Timoleon was associated with the victory over the Persian invaders. It’s a doubly appropriate choice for Timoleon, the vanquisher of tyrants and the Carthaginians._ 



*Around the time Timoleon was fighting in Sicily, [Archidamus III ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archidamus_III)of Sparta died fighting on behalf of the Spartan colony at Taras (Roman Tarentum) against Italian tribesmen.
