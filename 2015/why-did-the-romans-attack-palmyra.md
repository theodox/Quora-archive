__Roman Palmyra__ 

Rome annexed Palmyra at some point in the first century AD; it's not clear exactly when since the actual event isn't recorded in any sources. In this period the Romans generally preferred to rule indirectly, through friendly client kings; they resorted to annexation only when the local dynasty was unstable (like Herod's kingdom of Judaea) or strategically unreliable, but since we don't have direct records we don't know if the initial takeover was peaceful or mutually agreeable.

However it happened, Palmyra benefitted hugely from its relationship with Rome. When the Roman Republic breathed is last and the Mediterranean world was finally and permanently united under Augustus (in 27 BC), the creation of the empire ended more than a century of constant wars in the Mediterranean basin. This led to a huge economic boom, and the newly pacified West soon developed a huge hunger for luxury goods from the east. A thriving, extremely lucrative trade grew up between the Roman world and India -- some of it passing by sea from Egypt, and some of it heading overland through Syria (more detail[ in this question](https://www.quora.com/I-have-heard-that-ancient-Greece-and-Rome-were-having-trades-with-south-Indian-kingdoms-But-in-history-why-werent-these-given-much-importance-and-not-talked-about)) . Palmyra -- the city on the southernmost caravan route (and so the shortest route from Egypt to Babylon) made a fortune off the trade in both directions.

__The breakaway province__ 

In the 3rd century the empire descended into a long cycle of civil wars and military rebellions, known as the [Crisis of the Third Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century); between 235 and 284 AD there were no less than 33 emperors (for background see [this question](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires)). In Palmyra's neighborhood the civil wars were even more dangerous because the powerful [Sasanian Empire](http://Sasanian Empire) in Persia was squeezing the caravan trade and repeatedly threatened invasion. 

In 260, the Romans were soundly beaten by the Persians: emperor Valerian was taken on the battlefield and -- predictably -- the Romans started fighting each other over who would rule in his place. The Palmyrenes, who had a lot to lose if the Sassanids overran Syria, took the lead in improvising the defense; [Septimius Odaenathus](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Septimius-Odaenathus) of Palmyra earned the title of _corrector totius Orientis_  (“governor of all the East”) and expanded powers over the whole region. 

In theory, at least, this expanded Palmyrene kingdom was acting only as a loyal ally of Rome. In practice, emperor Gallienus was too weak to put that loyalty to the test: the military commander of Gaul had also essentially declared himself emperor as well, leaving the Roman world divided into 3 separate armed camps:

Odaenathus was assassinated in 267 and succeeded by his queen -- the famous [Zenobia,](http://womenshistory.about.com/od/ancientqueens/a/Zenobia.htm) a talented and strong-willed woman who led her armies in person. She was renowned for her beauty (she claimed to be a descendant of Cleopatra, though that's highly unlikely) and also her ability to keep up with her hard-riding cavalry.

 Zenobia enlarged her territories in all directions -- including into Roman Egypt and Asia Minor. Some of her battles were with the Persians, others with Romans of dubious loyalty. She maintained a skimpy figleaf of legitimacy -- continuing to issue coins with the Roman emperor's head on one side, for example --- but was clearly looking out for herself and her city. This was essentially a warlord era in which armies came first and questions of legality and legitimacy mattered little.

__The empire strikes back__ 

However, Zenobia pushed her luck too far when her troops took Egypt in 269. Whatever pretext she offered, no Roman emperor could leave Egypt and its vital grain supplies in the hands of a rival. Unfortunately for Zenobia the new emperor was not the hapless Gallienus but the redoubtable [Aurelian](http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/aurelian.html), who (after delaying to defeat 3 separate barbarian invasions in 270 and 271) marched down through Asia Minor in 272, peacefully re-occupying the cities which did not resist. Seeing which way the wind was blowing Egypt surrendered without a fight. 

Once the Romans arrived in Syria, Zenobia's army was quickly beaten in two pitched battles. The city of Palmyra surrendered and was spared. Zenobia and her son tried to escape to Persia, but they were captured and marched off to be led in triumph through the streets of Rome. Some sources say she survived and lived in comfortable exile outside of Rome; others that she committed suicide before being exhibited to the masses.

For the city, however, the aftermath is clear, and grim. After the main Roman army departed the city rose in rebellion. A 5 year old child, claimed to be Zenobia' son, was proclaimed king. The citizens massacred the Roman garrison. The Roman army quickly returned and sacked the city without mercy, a devastation from which it never really recovered.
