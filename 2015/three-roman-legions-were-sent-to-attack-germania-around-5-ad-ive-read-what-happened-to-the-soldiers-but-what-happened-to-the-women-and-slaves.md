I assume you're thinking of the [Battle of the Teutoburg Forest?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest)

One misconception of that happened there is that battle was part of a Roman invasion. It actually was the end of a more or less routine show of strength; Varus' legions were destroyed on their way back from forward operating base on the Weser, probably modern [Minden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minden) . The summer visit wasn't intended to capture territory but rather to remind the locals of Roman strength, collect tribute, and to allow Roman officials to meet with local leaders. 

Ancient armies often travelled with a cloud of civilian 'camp followers' - everything from food vendors and tailors to prostitutes, wives and children. These didn't participate in battles, of course (although it was pretty common for the camp followers to loot the dead after a battlefield). In the case of Varus' legions the extra followers were probably more numerous than usual: the settled life of the summer encampment would be good business for the different vendors and the mission wasn't expected to be particularly hazardous. According to Cassius Dio:

> They had with them many wagons and many beasts of burden as in time of peace; moreover, not a few women and children and a large retinue of servants were following them - one more reason for their advancing in scattered groups.

In a conventional battle the camp followers would hang back away from the fighting. But in the unusual terrain of the Teutoberg the legions and their followers were forced into an unusual and dangerous line of march.

 Most ancient armies preferred open field battles. It's hard enough in any case to command an army without radios, and in forests or tight spaces it's almost impossible. This battle was, however, definitely not a normal battle.

The German leader [Arminius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminius) was a trusted Roman ally with full access to the Romans' plans and a thorough knowledge of their tactics. He carefully designed a scenario to lure the Roman army into terrain where its superior arms and tactics would be useless: a series of bogs and ravines which made formation fighting and large scale maneuvers useless. The lack of roads and fields forced the Roman column to stretch out for miles along narrow paths, leaving the distant ends of the army unable to support each other.

A side effect of this was to push the camp followers into the Roman march column. In a more conventional battle the civilians would trail the army. In the cramped confines of the Teutoberg, with poor visibility and enemies lurking behind every bush and rock, the civilians naturally stayed as close to the Roman army as possible.

 _The forest was unfriendly to traditional marching and fighting_ 

For four days the Romans struggled as they were attacked on all sides. Swampy terrain and a carefully sited defensive wall near [Kalkriese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalkriese) made it impossible for the legions to move forward, but it was almost impossible to turn the distended Roman lines around. On the fourth day Varus killed himself and the Romans ceased to fight as an army. Clearly some stragglers escaped -- the details in the accounts in [Tacitus](http://www.livius.org/te-tg/teutoburg/tacitus.html)  and [ Velleius Paterculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Velleius_Paterculus) can only come from survivors -- but the overwhelming majority were lost. 

The Germans offered many captured Romans (particularly officers) as human sacrifice: a Roman army visited the battlefield six years later and found hastily raised altars and  skulls nailed to trees all around the site of the final battle. Lower-rankers were usually killed -- but not always. Slaves were of course a valuable kind of booty so once the immediate fury of the battle was over, many Germanic warriors found ways to spirit away persons who might be valuable at home. Almost 40 years later a Roman force found and liberated a handful of survivors of the Teutoberg disaster from the Chatti. 

 It's safe to assume that the camp followers suffered the same fate as the legionaries they accompanied: most of them will have been killed in the fighting but not all. If the usual ancient pattern holds the women and children would have fared a little better (albeit as slaves) than the men, since they were less dangerous and easier to commoditize. Unfortunately our sources, which were written by aristocrats more concerned with Roman honor than the lives of commoners, don't tell us enough to know more than that. Tony Clunn's [Quest for the Lost Roman Legions](http://www.amazon.com/QUEST-FOR-LOST-ROMAN-LEGIONS/dp/1932714707) has a good, imaginative reconstruction of the battle, extended with good archaeological evidence; it is, however, still just a plausible conjecture.
