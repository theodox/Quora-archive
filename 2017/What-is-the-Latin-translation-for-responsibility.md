In an official or external sense, I’d go with _[cura](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=cura)_ _,_ which is the great grand-daddy of our “care” . It’s where we get “curator” and “curate”, it comes with the sense of being responsible for or concerned with something.

For the personal quality of being responsible, I’d try [fidelitas](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=fidelitas&la=la#Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=studium-contents). We usually translate it as ‘faithfulness’, but coming from [fidus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dfidus1) it has the overtones of trustworthy, reliable and “there when you need it”.

I can’t find a good attestation for _responsibilitas_ in ancient sources. _Responsabilis, “_ answerable for,” is medieval church Latin. That’s the ultimate origin of our word.

_Onus_  means a burden, so by extension it can be a responsibility — as in “the onus is on you to do your homework”.

_Noxa_  means “harm” (an “innocent” is “in-nocens”, “not harming”). So the injury you do to somebody else is a _noxa —_ in a legal case it would be the “damages.”

_Auctoritas_  is very much our “authority” — it’s what a statesman or general has.
