Two different Q's here. 

For the imperial terminology, it's pretty simple. They all overlap in space, sharing a heartland in modern Iraq and Iran. But they don't overlap in time. They are all "Persian" in the sense that they are dominated by people who spoke Iranic languages with some connection to the Old Persian of the empire of Cyrus -- but the line of descent is pretty tangled.

The "Persian Empire" is the empire of Cyrus and his descendants. If you want to be precise you call it the [Achaemenid Empire ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire)after the name of Cyrus' family. This dates from the time of Cyrus down to the conquest of Alexander the Great (550â€“330 BC)

The Seleucid Empire was the Greek-ruled empire that emerged in the region after Alexander's death in 323 BC. It was founded by one of the Greek warlords who divided up Alexander's territories after his death. This empire's history is messy: after they lost a war against the rival Greek empire of the Ptolemies in 247 BC, their farthest eastern territories (in modern Afghanistan and Pakistan) split off to become the [Greco-Bactrian Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom#Independence_.28around_250_BC.29) and the northern parts modern Iran did the same, becoming the new Parthian kingdom. Over the next 200 years or so the Seleucid empire's center of gravity drifted west until it was little more than modern Syria; the Parthians took most of what the Seleucids lost. The rump Seleucid empire was finally absorbed by the Roman Empire in 63 BC.

The [Parthian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire) which emerged in the former Seleucid territories claimed to be the inheritor of the old Achaemenid traditions, though for a long time it retained many of the Greek-style insitutions of the Seleucids (the famous Parthian victory over the Romans at Carrhae in 53BC was announced to the Parthian king during a performance of Euripides' _Bacchae_ ). It's not clear if there was really any family connection between the Parthians' Arsacid dynasty and the Achaemenids but there is no question that they Parthian's wanted to wrap themselves in the mantle of Cyrus. Their [language w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_language)as distinct from, but related to the Persian language of the Achaemenids; they used a mix of Persian, Greek and Aramaic for official purposes. The Parthan state lasted for about 500 years and was a powerful rival to the Romans for most of that time. However it was prone to civil wars and eventually fragmented (in 224 AD) in the midst of another one.

The [Sassanid_Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire) was created by [Ardashir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardashir_I), who started his career as a vassal of the Parthians but expanded his power at their expense, eventually overthrowing and killing the last Parthian emperor in 224. In language and custom the Sassanids were quite similar to the Parthians, but in politics and religion they were very different. The Parthian empire was a feudal one, with many powerful nobles who didn't always cooperate willingly with the state. The Sassanids were much more centralized (claiming, again, to follow the example of Cyrus). They also promoted [Zoroastrianism as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism) a state religion. In general they tended to promote Iranian cultural norms over influences from outside.

However, none of all that is an exact answer to the question 'when do these people become "Persian"', because there's no single answer to that. 

 Zoroastrian religion was a common point of reference from the time of Cyrus down to the Islamic conquest, but at different times it was more or less open to outside influences like Greek philosophy and Christianity, as reflected in the emergence of [Manichaeism ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism)later in the Sassanid period. The written literature of that period, particularly the [Avesta ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avesta)was a common thread down till the Islamic conquest, and poetry was also a key continuer throughout this period.

_Another instance of continuity: this carpet is recognizably 'Persian' to us -- but it's Sassanian, from the 5th century_ 

 The Persian's of Cyrus' time spoke _a_  Persian language, but not necessarily _the_  Persian language: the history of Iranic languages is [pretty complex and extends outside the limits of imperial politic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language#New_Persian)s : this picture of Iranic languages today gives some idea of how varied that family is:

_This is just modern Persian-related languages. In antiquity it was more complex_  

Different regional and tribal groups merged, split and remerged repeatedly throughout antiquity and they borrowed ideas and modes of expression from each other. Accidents of politics could lump groups together or divide them,

As for the empires, many of their subject were not Persian in any sense other than being subjects of Persian overlords: the most populous part of these empires was Mesopotamia,which was an ethnic melting pot where Aramaic (a Semitic language, unrelated to Persian) was the common tongue. Persian-language-family speakers were the dominant demographic group east of the Zagros mountains (you can see that on the map above) but not the only one. 

Also, nany peoples spoke Iranic languages outside the Iranian plateau, even if they were never part of these empires: the [Alans,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alans) for example, hitchhiked along with the Germanic invasions of the Roman empire and ended up in France and Spain. Modern [Ossetian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossetian_language)is an Iranian language but one with no political ties to ancient or modern Iran. [Kurdish ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_languages)is also part of the Iranic language family. It would not be wise, for example, to tell most Kurds, however, that they are "Persians"
