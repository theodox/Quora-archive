# Is there anything from Counter-Strike: GO that can be compared to the real military in terms of how the teams hold a site or invade one?

All games suffer from several basic problems in simulating real tactics: 

Real guns are much heavier and more unwieldy than a computer cross hair (especially on PC with a high-res mouse). Expert players can acquire targets and hit them accurately much faster than their real life counterparts: while there may be tactical wizards in the real world who can do a 180 mid-air jump and hit a target while doing it, they are vanishingly rare, while on-line they are pretty common.

On the other hand, the combination of player expectations and camera field of view means that players can try things in games that make no sense in real life. Gamers can rush a defender head on trying to get an easy close up shot, banking on the fact that their 2-d images will cross the screen very quickly because of the perspective projection. Although CS is much 'slower' than many other games it is still very fast in real world terms -- especially because gamers, unlike real soldiers, aren't lugging scores of pounds of extra ammo, body armor, and equipment. The fact that a player only needs one hitpoint left at the end of an exchange to 'win' -- where a real soldier in the same situation would be headed for a coma -- encourages behavior that would be completely suicidal in a real firefight.

Moreover real world considerations that matter a lot to tactical operators don't factor in games. One of the reasons for the famous 'crab walk' you see in SWAT videos is the need to keep solid footing: slipping on a stray cartridge or a spot of blood can be very costly in the real world (so can jumping off a 3' box and twisting your ankle!) Real world fighters are much more cautious than CS players or other gamers.

Sound management also plays a role. Tactical operators tend to obsess over things like not having stray clips jangling on their harnesses, or walky-talkies blasting out news (hence those tactical earpieces in the movies). In games it's much harder to localize a sound - only players with headphones can get even halfway accurate sound directions, and those dont' take into account the details of geometry. In the real world the guy who hears the other fella coming around the corner is usually going to win.

So, overall I'd say that CS simulates combat about like Chess does: it captures some of the flavor (particularly compared to other shooters) but it's an artistic impression of the real experience. Something like [Full Spectrum Warrior](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/full-spectrum-warrior) is probably a closer (though still highly abstract) representation of the real thing.
