The golden age of over-the-top symbolism is the Early Modern era, particularly the 17th century. The explosion of literacy (in Greek, Hebrew and Latin as well as vernacular languages), the sudden influx of 2,000 years worth of poorly understood ancient literature, fashionable Neo-platonism and the hermetic tradition of allegory led to a gigantic Symbolism bubble.

Here's a few doozies:

[Robert Fludd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fludd) was an alchemist and hermetic philosopher: pretty much everything he wrote is symbolism city, from numerology to the meaning of colors. Here's a just a few of his better ones:

The macrosocosm: the arrangement of the heavens is reflected in the proportions of the human body. Note the astrological symbols!

The [Celestial Monochord ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochord)demonstrates the numerological relationships between music, the celestial spheres, and the soul:

Here the macrocosm/microcosm applied to disease: illnesses attach the body from 4 directions, associated with 4 demons opposed by 4 archangels. corresponding to the numerals 1 through 4, the 4 humors, the 4 compass directions and the 4 elements _at the same time._  Can't beat that!

But even better than Fludd is the famous polymath [Athanasius Kircher ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasius_Kircher)who wrote about just about everything -- usually jamming it all into a crazy symbolic sausage-grinder of Cabbalism, numerology, and astrology along with surprisingly practical science. Here's a few of his best:

The title page of [Musurgia Universalis , 1650 ](http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/nov2002.html)shows the Holy Trinity illuminating the practice of music as an illustration of universal laws of harmony and proportion as discovered by Pythagoras (lower left) and the muses (lower right). Below are blacksmiths in a cave, the ringing of whose hammers first taught the Greeks the relationship between music and numerical ratios.

Kircher also made a valiant, if failed attempt at understanding Egyptian hieroglyphs  by way of Cabbalah in the [Oedipus Aegyptiacus. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Aegyptiacus)There's so many layers of symbolic indirection in that project it's hard to know where to start! Here's the Egyptian goddess Isis, for example, in a numerological Caballistic dart board listing the names of God in 72 languages. English, _Angli,_ is around 4'0 clock -- zoom in to find efforts at Chinese, Japonese and even Nahuatl (! "Mexicani")) For numerological reasons though he's forced every term into 4 characters.

To be fair Kircher was right that the language of the hieroglyphs was essentially Coptic... [though that was about all he got right.](http://publicdomainreview.org/2013/05/16/athanasius-kircher-and-the-hieroglyphic-sphinx/)  Here his title page uses the riddle of the sphinx as a symbol for his symbolic-numerological-allegorical method of decoding hieroglyphs:

and here a variety of Greek and Egyptian myths re-interpreted as allegories for basic science and philosophical principles:

   Kircher is just a gift that keeps on giving... lots more here: [Athanasius Kircher at Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/group/kircher/cgi-bin/site/?page_id=517) 

But wait, there's more! The 17th century is the Saudia Arabia of allegories.

Robert Burtons [The Anatomy of Melancholy, 1620 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anatomy_of_Melancholy)is a very, _very_  in-depth look at the psychology of depression. It's so full of astrological, historical, literary, philosophical, medical and theological citations that it's basically unreadable. But it's awesome: Each type of melancholy (_melanus choler,_ or black bile, was regarded as the chemical source of depression) comes with astrological and symbolic attributes.

And if you wanted a secret-hidden-in-plain-sight you could do worse than this famous, but eminently creepy title page for Thomas Hobbes' _Leviathan:_

This is one a bit later: it'a one of several title page illustrations for Gianbattista's _Scienza Nuova_  ("The New Science"), 1725. his philosophy of history. It doesn't come more symbolic than this.
