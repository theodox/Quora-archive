# What prevented the Romans from conquering, or at least colonizing, present-day Germany? Were they prevented from doing so, or was this a deliberate choice?

It was more or less a deliberate strategic decision. German tribes were famously warlike, and the costs of defending the territory were seen as greater than the benefits. The Rhine and (less effectively) the Danube formed natural defensive boundaries and it was far cheaper and more efficient to use these as permanent boundaries. The Romans didn't do a great job at exploiting the climate and agricultural conditions in northern Europe (this is one of the reasons the western empire was so much poorer than the eastern half) and so the prize was not all that tempting in any case. 

In the late Republic and early empire it seemed as if another policy might be tried: Roman armies operated frequently between the Rhine and the Weser and there was a semi-permanent camp probably near Minden. However the disaster in the Teutoburg Forest (links in other answers) underscored the costs of an active occupation, and after that the main goal of policy was to find maintain good defenses and to support friendly clients along the border to prevent large-scale movements into Roman territory. Bits and pieces of territory were absorbed - or sometimes abandoned - to make the defensive perimiter easier and cheaper to defend. Punitive expeditions and interventions into Germany were common -- Roman armies would chase raiders or intervene in disputes between nearby tribes or contested succession, but not to 'conquer'. 

The frontier evolved between the time of Augustus and that of Hadrian and then was fairly stable until the bad times of the 3d century. After that, increasing pressure from outside, the ongoing decline of the Roman economy, and persistent internal strife meant that Rome was going to remain on the defensive until the massive failure of the frontier defenses in 406 and the rapid disintegration of the western empire.
