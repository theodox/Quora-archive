In Roman tradition there were [seven kings of Rome ](https://digitalmapsoftheancientworld.com/history-ancient-rome/the-roman-kingdom-753-509-bc/)before the Romans rebelled against the last one, creating a republic which would remain the Roman government for the next 500 years.

While the republic was intact it had a unique system with _two_  annually elected chief executive officers, known as [consuls](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/consul/). This was intended as a check on ambitious politicians who might seek to become sole rulers. In times of great emergency the Romans occasionally appointed a temporary sole ruler known as a dictator. However the office was limited to the duration of the crisis, and the Romans idolized one-time dictators who [peacefully resigned their office after a few months](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-Roman-thing-ever).

After several successful centuries the republic became increasingly unstable. Military commanders like [Julius Caesar](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/julius-caesar) became powerful enough to challenge the dominance of the state, and after a century of intermittent civil wars the Romans eventually came to value stability over political liberty. Caesar’s adopted son — the man we know as [Augustus ](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/caesar-augustus)— finally converted the republic into a military dictatorship, although he and his immediate successors retained a flimsy pretense of republican institutions.

After around the year 100 it was common for the Greek speaking half of the empire to refer casually to the reigning emperor as [basileus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basileus#Romans_and_Byzantines)or “king.” However in the Latin speaking world “king” remained a taboo word down to the end of the Latin-speaking half of the empire. In the surviving, Greek-speaking half of the empire the word _basileus_ came to mean “emperor” by around the 7th century, and _rex_  _—_ the Latin word for “king” — was repurposed to mean “foreign king below the rank of our emperor.”
