Alexander wasn’t mummified — his body was preserved in honey, as Statius said of a traveler bound for Alexandria in the Roman era:

> _duc et ad Emathios manes ubi belliger urbis
conditor Hyblaeo perfusus nectare durat_ 

> Lead him also to the Emathian [=Macedonian] tombs, where 
the warrior-founder of the city, sleeps drenched in honey from Hybla

[Silvae, III.2](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Stat.+Silv.+3.2&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0499)

Alexander died in Babylon and his body was supposed to be sent home to Macedon. The practice of embalming in honey was popular among Assyrians (at least, according to Herodotus) though it probably originated in the Caucasus [where bee-keeping first took off](https://www.quora.com/Did-people-keep-bee-farms-in-ancient-times-If-so-do-we-know-who-did-it/answer/Steve-Theodore). Presumably the local authorities in Babylon knew its use first hand and recommended it to the Macedonian generals as a preservative. This was not, at this point, motivated by a religious belief — Macedonians traditionally practiced a mix of Greek-style cremation and inhumation.

Alexander’s body only ended up in Egypt because it was literally hijacked on the road by Alexander’s lieutenant (and, it was rumored, half-brother) Ptolemy, the Macedonian governor of Egypt. This was intended to symbolize the legitimacy of Ptolemy’s personal rule in Egypt where Alexander, who had defeated the hated Persians, was wildly popular. It was also a power move in the complex politics between the Macedonian generals [which tore Alexander’s apart within a decade of his death](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-the-descendants-of-Alexander-the-Great/answer/Steve-Theodore). This bit of grave-robbing resulted in a war: the rest of Alexander’s generals banded together intending to reclaim the body, but they were defeated in a[ grisly battle along the Nile in which crocodiles and hippopotami savaged the wounded.](https://www.timetravelrome.com/2019/02/25/the-tragedy-of-perdiccas-at-memphis/) The failure of the expedition pretty much doomed the unity of Alexander’s domain.

Ptolemy’s descendants would continue to rule Egypt for the next three centuries, ending with the famous Cleopatra’s death in 30 BC. During that time they made a point of patronizing traditional Egyptian religion as a way of conciliating their Egyptian subjects. The[ relationship was extremely complicated](https://www.quora.com/How-did-Ancient-Egyptians-view-themselves-after-centuries-of-Hellenisation/answer/Steve-Theodore), though [always unequal ](https://www.quora.com/Can-the-Hellenistic-kingdoms-be-classified-as-colonialist/answer/Steve-Theodore)(Cleopatra, the last Ptolemy, was famously the first member of her dynasty who knew how to speak Egyptian).

Nevertheless there were cross-cultural currents in both directions. Greek language and culture dominated government and the military, but cultural borders were somewhat porous. Some native Egyptians participated in the public Greek culture of cities like Alexandria, and plenty of Greeks adopted varying aspects of Egyptian in private. In particular, Egyptian ideas about the afterlife resonated with many Greeks resident in Egypt — so mummification eventually became a popular method of embalming.

This trend continued into the Roman era, and we have a [large trove of amazing Greco-Egyptian mummies](https://fayoumegypt.com/fayoum-portraits/) from the [Faiyum Oasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faiyum_Oasis). These are remarkable examples of the complex hybrid culture of Egypt — there are Egyptian, Greek and Roman individuals buried as mummies, usually with some elements of Egyptian funereal traditions, but accompanied by remarkable, lifelike portraits rather than the impersonal abstract representations common in older Egyptian art.

In addition to being a testimony to the Egypt’s unique cultural synthesis these are the more direct and lifelike portraits to have survived from antiquity. They are an amazing introduction to the many-layered tapestry of life in Greco-Roman Egypt.
