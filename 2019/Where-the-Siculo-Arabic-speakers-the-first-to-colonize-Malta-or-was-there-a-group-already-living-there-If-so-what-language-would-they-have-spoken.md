# Where the Siculo-Arabic speakers the first to colonize Malta, or was there a group already living there? If so, what language would they have spoken?

Malta has been peopled for a very long time; the oldest traces of human inhabitants go back about 7,000 years. Until recently the famous [megalithic temples of Malta](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/132), a series of Stonehenge-like structures dating back as far as 3600 BC or so, were believed to be the oldest free-standing structures in the world.*

The so-called “[Venus of Malta](http://jauntingjen.com/7-strange-artifacts-from-malta/),” — found near the temple of [Ħaġar Qim ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A6a%C4%A1ar_Qim)and dated to about 3300 BC — reflects the widespread Neolithic culture of the Mediterranean:

It appears that the original Maltese society collapsed around 2500 BC — there’s a significant gap in the archaeology, and the culture which produced the temples disappears from the record. A new set of artifacts appears in the Bronze Age, with indications of close connections with Sicily but also trade with other parts of the Mediterranean. Unfortunately both Neolithic and Bronze Age Malta leave no written records, apart from a few out-of-place artifacts.

The islands were colonized by the Phoenicians in the 8th century BC — the name “Malta” probably derives from the Phoenician word “Maleth”, “shelter”. Phoenician colonies were usually trading posts, not agricultural settlements, so the Phoenicians lived alongside the pre-existing population rather than replacing them whole cloth. However Phoenician culture and language became the most common (or at least, the most commonly recorded) ones on the islands.

The first written records on Malta are in Phoenician, and there are Phoenician inscriptions all the way up into the Roman period. The [Cippi of Melqart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cippi_of_Melqart), from the 2d century BC, are vital texts in the study of the Phoenician language because they contain matching inscriptions in Greek: a kind of Maltese Rosetta Stone.

Malta entered the Roman empire after the Punic wars, and remained Roman up to the Muslim conquest in the 9th century. During that period Latin and Greek were both used alongside Phoenician (interestingly, Maltese Phoenician remained more similar to the original language of the Levant, distinct from the Punic dialect of Carthage and Roman Africa). [When St. Paul was shipwrecked on Malta in the first century](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/acts/28.htm) the islanders were “βάρβαροι” — barbarians who did not speak Greek. However it’s not clear if the author of Acts considered Latin speakers “barbarians” — Greek usage was inconsistent on that point — so this could mean either that his rescuers spoke Phoenician or Latin.

We don’t have much evidence for the linguistic profile of the island after the late Roman period; we can guess that during the Byzantine period (535–870) the linguistic situation resembled Sicily where the language of law and administration was Greek and the bulk of the population spoke a mix of vulgar Latin and Greek. It’s possible that Phoenician-derived speech was still around but there is no evidence for it in the later empire (Carthaginian Punic survived at least until the 5th, and probably until the 7th century — however it was used by a much larger population).

So, before the [Muslim conquest in 870](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Melite_(870)) the island’s speech involved a mix of Greek, Latin and possibly Phoenician influences. Arabic-language sources describe the conquest of 870 as a complete genocide of the existing Maltese population, though it’s likely this is an exaggeration. In any case the population was quite small — the estimate for the population after the resettlement in the 11th century is only about 20,000 people — so it would be fairly easy for the language of the newcomers to swamp that of anyone who had remained on the islands.

As a last word, it’s good to remember that our sources are overhwelmingly biased towards the languages of government and religion, which didn’t always reflect what people actually spoke at home — we casually use “spoken” when we really mean “written.” It’s entirely possible for a “Siculo-Arabic speaker” to have spoken Greek or Siculo at home and only used the language of his or her rulers when paying taxes or going to court. The written records show wild swings in linguistic affiliation between about 700 and 1200 but we know how tenacious languages can be in other contexts ([Griko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griko_dialect) in Italy, and [African Romance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Romance) in North Africa, for example). Modern [Siculo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_language) has no official status and leaves mostly indirect traces in the written records even though it’s the majority spoken tongue in Sicily. So it’s good to be a bit tentative about the meaning of these accounts.
