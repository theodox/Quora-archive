There was no single origin story that all the Greeks agreed on; the most common tale was that most people were ultimately descended from the children of [Deucalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deucalion) (depending on the story there could be his offspring or could be magically repopulated after the Flood).

Tales of descent from a particular god were almost always tied up with claims of aristocratic ancestry. A divine ancestor was a common (though not a universal) claim for noble clans but not every Greek shared in the distinction.

In the particular case of the Dorians, the notion of descent from Herakles is part of a larger mythical theme, known as the [return of the Heracleidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_invasion). This involves a number of stories that provide a mythological justification for the Dorian presence in the Peloponessus and Thebes. The Dorians were not native to those areas; they originated farther north (Herodotus puts them first in Thessaly, then in Doris west of Thebes) but they ruled as a separate upper caste distinct in bloodline from their subjects. The key element of the myth — at least in historic times — wasn’t the claim to divinity but the assertion of a shared ethnic origin that distinguished the Dorians from the people they ruled.

The Argeads claimed to be connected to the royal house of Argos (the one in all the classic plays) . We don’t really know if this reflects a historical reality — it’s possible that what eventually became the kingdom of Macedon was in fact founded by adventurers from Argos — or if it’s just another mythological justification: for a frontier people like the Macedonians, whose Greek credentials were suspect, a tie to the deep roots of Greek legend was a powerful claim to true Hellenicity.

Generally speaking stories of divine descent all seem to go with genealogies or local traditions that extend back into the Greek Dark Age (~ 1250–800 BC)… a period which, conveniently for the those doing the genealogies, had no writing. Once the Greeks started dealing with other cultures — particularly those with much longer institutional memories — they got a bit self-conscious about how short some of those genealogical trees really were. The best story on this score is recorded by Herodotus (2.143), and is one of the great, subtle, intercultural snubs of all time.

> Hecataeus the historian was once at Thebes where he made a genealogy for himself that had him descended from a god in the sixteenth generation. But the priests of Zeus did with him as they also did with me (who had not traced my own lineage). They brought me into the great inner court of the temple and showed me wooden figures there which they counted to the total they had already given, for every high priest sets up a statue of himself there during his lifetime; pointing to these and counting, the priests showed me that each succeeded his father; they went through the whole line of figures, back to the earliest from that of the man who had most recently died.

> Thus, when Hecataeus had traced his descent and claimed that his sixteenth forefather was a god, the priests too traced a line of descent according to the method of their counting; for they would not be persuaded by him that a man could be descended from a god; they traced descent through the whole line of three hundred and forty-five figures, not connecting it with any ancestral god or hero, but declaring each figure to be a “Piromis” the son of a “Piromis”; in Greek, one who is in all respects a good man.

> Thus they showed that all those whose statues stood there had been good men, but quite unlike gods. Before these men, they said, the rulers of [Egypt](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/entityvote?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=2:chapter=144&auth=tgn,7016833&n=1&type=place) were gods, but none had been contemporary with the human priests.
