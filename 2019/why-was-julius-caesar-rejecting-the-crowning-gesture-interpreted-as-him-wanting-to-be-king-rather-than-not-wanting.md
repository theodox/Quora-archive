# Why was Julius Caesar rejecting the crowning gesture interpreted as him wanting to be king rather than not wanting?

To some degree it’s simply a suspicion — though it’s a suspicion that goes pretty far back in the sources. Here’s [Plutarch’s version](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#61):

> [Antony] carried a diadem, round which a wreath of laurel was tied, and held it out to Caesar. Then there was applause, not loud, but slight and preconcerted. But when Caesar pushed away the diadem, all the people applauded; and when Antony offered it again, few, and when Caesar declined it again, all, applauded. The experiment having thus failed, Caesar rose from his seat, after ordering the wreath to be carried up to the Capitol; but then his statues were seen to have been decked with royal diadems. So two of the tribunes, Flavius and Maryllus, went up to them and pulled off the diadems, and after discovering those who had first hailed Caesar as king, led them off to prison… Caesar was greatly vexed, and deprived Maryllus and Flavius of their office, while in his denunciation of them, although he at the same time insulted the people, he called them repeatedly Brutes and Cymaeans.

And [Suetonius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#79):

> at the Latin Festival, as he was returning to the city, amid the extravagant and unprecedented demonstrations of the populace, someone in the press placed on his statue a laurel wreath with a white fillet [a symbol of royalty] tied to it; and when Epidius Marullus and Caesetius Flavius, tribunes of the commons, gave orders that the ribbon be removed from the wreath and the man taken off to prison, Caesar sharply rebuked and deposed them, either offended that the hint at regal power had been received with so little favour, or, as he asserted, that he had been robbed of the glory of refusing it. But from that time on he could not rid himself of the odium of having aspired to the title of monarch

and [Appian](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/2*.html#109):

> some person among those who wished to spread the report of his desire to be king placed a crown of laurel on his statue, bound with a white fillet. The tribunes, Marullus and Caesetius, sought out this person and put him in prison, pretending to gratify Caesar also by this, as he had threatened any who should talk about making him king. Caesar put up with their action, and when some others who met him at the city gates as he was returning from some place greeted him as king, and the people groaned, he said with happy readiness to those who had thus saluted him, "I am not King, I am Caesar," as though they had mistaken his name. The attendants of Marullus again found out which man began the shouting and ordered the officers to bring him to trial before his tribunal. Caesar at last put up with it no longer and accused the faction of Marullus before the Senate of artfully conspiring to cast upon him the odium of royalty. He added that they were deserving of death, but that it would be sufficient if they were deprived of their office and expelled from the Senate. Thus he confirmed the suspicion that he desired the title, and that his tyranny was already complete; for the cause of their punishment was their zeal against the title of king, and, moreover, the office of tribune was sacred and inviolable according to law and the ancient oath. By not even waiting for the expiration of their office he sharpened the public indignation.

As you can see the famous events of the Lupercal were part of a larger picture. The harsh treatment of the tribunes — who were, in theory, completely immune from any legal sanction during their terms of office — was even more scandalous to Roman opinion. The tribunate was deeply tied up with the dignity of the ordinary Roman citizen, it was an office specifically designed to protect the rights of common people against the excesses of the powerful. When Caesar summarily dismissed the tribunes it was widely seen as proof that he had no care for traditional Roman freedoms; in many eyes this was proof that he himself had orchestrated the affairs and was angry that they had been a PR disaster. Most of the ancient sources actually treat the fate of the tribunes the real trigger behind the conspiracies that ended Caesar’s life.

On the other hand this is ultimately politics — and like all politics everywhere it involves a good deal of speculation about “real” motives. [Cassius Dio](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/46*.html#17) quotes [Quintus Fufius Calenus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Fufius_Calenus) a lieutenant of Antony, like this:

> Yet this same Antony, witness earth and gods! (I shall call louder than you and invoke them with greater justice), when he saw that the city was already in reality under a tyranny, inasmuch as all the legions obeyed Caesar and all the people together with the senate submitted to him to such an extent that they voted, among other measures, that he should be dictator for life and use the trapping of the kings — this Antony, I say, convinced Caesar of his error most cleverly and restrained him most prudently, until Caesar, abashed and afraid, would not accept either the name of king or the diadem, which he had in mind to bestow upon himself even against our will….

> Antony, however, because he was thoroughly acquainted with Caesar's intentions and perfectly aware of all he was preparing to do, by great good judgment succeeded in turning him aside from his course and dissuaded him. The proof is that Caesar afterwards no longer behaved in any way like a monarch, but mingled publicly and unprotected with us all; and for this reason more than for any other it became possible that he should meet the fate he did.

Again - it’s politics. Calenus here is arguing against Cicero. Cicero himself refers to the events of the Lupercal many times — but always to illustrate how willing Antony was to sell out the Republic: he never accuses Caesar of planning to become a “king” though he is of course quite bitter about Caesar’s usurpation of power. In fact Dio [quotes him too](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/45*.html#41):

> by the very nature of [Antony’s] conduct, Caesar perished at _his_ hands. For the one who provided the motive, so that there seemed to be some justice in plotting against Caesar, is this fellow who called him king, who gave him the diadem, who previously slandered him even to his friends.

Of course, as much as Cicero hated Caesar’s politics he had a grudging respect for him as a man; Antony he hated privately, and so the arch-republican Cicero is happy to pin the _real_ bad motives on Antony even if it means Caesar is absolved of royalist, rather than dictatorial ambitions.

So: Caesar’s treatment of the tribunes, as well as his close relationship with Antony, were easy fodder for people to suspect him. But — like so many other questions of politics — it’s a matter of perception rather than fact.
