The Nefertiti bust stands out from most Egyptian portraiture for a couple of reasons. First off, it's a stunning work of art :

Because it was never put on public display, it escaped many of the the accidents which befell other Egyptian sculptures; the intact coloring and lack of vandalism give us a rare glimpse of an almost-pristine, human scale work unlike the bare stone or highly weathered works we see in lots of other Egyptian settings. 

Most importantly, it's a glimpse of the only period in Egyptian art history that really stepped outside the rigid canons of traditional Egyptian culture. Nefertiti's husband, the renegade Pharaoh [Akhenaten](http://www.livescience.com/39349-akhenaten.html), tried to radically overhaul the traditional Egyptian religion. Part of his program was supporting innovative artistic styles -- something his ultra-conservative predecessors generally frowned on. The [Amarna style](http://www.britannica.com/art/Amarna-style) included naturalism but also stylized exaggeration along with detailed attention to individual personality: all traits very rare in Egyptian art before and afterwards. The strong personality which the piece projects is a marked contrast to the idealized, stereotypical images which dominate most Egyptian art.

The bust was found in a sculptor's studio -- not, like most other artifacts, in a temple or burial ground. It gives us a fascinating glimpse into what Egyptian artists could do when they were not constrained by the elaborate rules inherited down the centuries.
