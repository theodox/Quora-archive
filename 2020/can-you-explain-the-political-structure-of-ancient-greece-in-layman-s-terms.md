This takes a good deal of explaining. Ancient Greece is defined by fragmentation, so summarizing it tricky. What follows is very, very compressed and omits a lot of important details.

__The setting__ 

Before talking about the politics its important to understand the physical parameters — looking a a modern map can give you a very misleading idea of what Greek politics was really about.

With a handful of exceptions, the average Greek polity is what we today call a “city-state.” All that really means, however, is that most Greek states were tiny: too small to sustain more than a single serious urban center. Athens, the largest of the city-states, is usually said to have a population of about 300,000 — but it’s important to remember that this represents not the population of the urban area, but of the whole political unit. The urban core of Attica was more in the ballpark of 50,000, only twice headcount of the suburban bedroom community where I grew up. Athens’ territory was about a thousand square miles / 2500 square km— smaller than Rhode Island, the smallest American state. The very longest walk you could do in Attica was only about 60 miles / 100 km — you could easily traverse the whole place on foot in three days.

Yet Athens was, by Greek standards, a _superpower_ .

Most other Greek city-states were much smaller; an urban core of 10,000 supported by a rural population of 50,000 would make you a regional power.

Theses tiny states reflect they physical geography of Greece — the mainland is divided by many mountains and arms of the sea into dozens of micro-regions, while the Aegean and Ionian are dotted by small islands. Exerting political control over this fragmented landscape was extremely difficult — overland travel was usually funneled through well known, narrow passes and the numerous small islands were a breeding ground for pirates and smugglers.

All of this adds up to the key fact about Greek politics. “Greece” was an abstraction. The _only_ state which ever united the ancient Greek world under one political system was the Roman empire. __Greece was a__ ___region,___ __not a country__ : more like “Europe” or “The Arab World” than like “France” or “Saudi Arabia”.

__Political types__ 

The political fragmentation of the Greek world meant a great deal of diversity in political arrangements, which make it very difficult to answer the question in a simple summary fashion: there hundreds of distinct Greek political entities, including democracies, monarchies, republics, federations and a few more exotic arrangements. Describing them in detail would be a daunting task.

However the Greeks themselves typically used three main categories when describing their political arrangements: __rule by one person, rule by a minority, and rule by the majority.__ Each of these might be good or bad — you could have a virtuous king or a vicious tyrant, an enlightened self-governing democracy or fickle mob-rule. Traditionally these forms were seen as historically connected— each type having characteristic weaknesses which led to its downfall over time and replacement by another, a rotation which they called “the wheel” or [cyclos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyklos#:~:text=Polybius,ochlocracy%2C%20oligarchy%2C%20and%20tyranny.). Philosophers differed about the order of rotation — did monarchy arise out of failed democracy or failed aristocracy? However that combination of contrast and relatedness makes a good starting point to generalize about the otherwise extraordinary variety of Greek political institutions.

Naturally everything that follows is a broad brush picture — in total the Greek world was home to more than a thousand sovereign states but our sources tell us primarily about a tiny handful. It’s also heavily dependent on information recorded primarily by Aristotle, who of course had opinions and agendas of his own. So: let the reader beware.

__The Few__ 

By far the most common political structure is a __city-state republic__ , governed primarily by a privileged class but with limited forms of political participation for other free men (only — no Greek state enfranchised women).

When describing this form of government positively, the Greeks called it _aristokrateia_ , “rule by the best” — our word is __aristocracy__ . When describing it negatively, they’d call it _oligarcheia_ , “rule by a few”, which gives us __oligarchy.__  The primary distinction between them is moral and emotional, not structural; if the republic is basically run exclusively for the benefit of the privileged it’s an oligarchy, if it’s run in the interest of the population at large, it’s an aristocracy. Naturally, few people tended to describe themselves and their friends as oligarchs.*

The republican structure was oriented around two basic problems: __defense against outside enemies__  and the __maintenance of order__  at home. Most Greek states did not have anything like a “welfare state,” few even provided basic services like police or fire protection. Instead, their primary job was to keep outsiders at bay while making sure that factions at home did not endanger the collective.

__External defense__  was a collective enterprise, and it was the ultimate determinant of how the state was structured.

These tiny states could not afford a standing professional army. Thus to be a citizen was to be a member of the _laos_ , the city militia, and vice-versa. Politics and military preparedness were always inextricably linked in Greece. Thus, in most states, political rights came with a property qualification: but typically, the bar for full citizenship was the ability to afford the shield, spear, and helmet needed to take your place in the main line of battle. At the top of the social and political pyramid were the handful of wealthy men who could provide their own _horses:_ a precious luxury in most of Greece where pasture land was scarce. In pretty much any Greek state, the social elite were known as the _[hippeis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippeis)_ _,_ the cavalry — though_i_ n a maritime city a similar role would be played by those wealthy enough to outfit their own warships. Below the wealthiest elite were a larger group who were able to provide the full “panoply”, the complete suit of armor and weapons that fitted you out to fight in the front lines of a Greek army. The less prosperous but still independent could provide only partial equipment (a helmet, a shield and a spear).

The citizen militia was, thus, the epicenter of city-state politics. If you carried a weapon in the city’s defense you’d have some voice, albeit one that was usually muted by wealth and hereditary privilege. On the other hand if you had no place on the battlefield you were also excluded from formal politics. Women and slaves were excluded everywhere. Different cities offered different levels of participation to poor free men who might handle a sling or a spear in an emergency but were not part of the vital armored front lines. Sparta is an interesting illustration of the point: the ultimate rationale for Sparta’s unique way of life was a kind of class-leveling project _within_  the class of heavy-infantry warriors — the true Spartans were a small, elite minority (no more than about one-seventh of the population) but they proudly referred to themselves as the _homoioi_ , “The Equals.”

When this was done (in 6th century BC Athens, before the democracy took hold) the class significance would have been obvious to any viewer: these men represent the three political classes of Solon’s constitution.

__Internal stability__  was the second job of politics.

Endemic low-grade warfare meant that dissension at home was dangerous: a Greek city which gave in to civil conflict was vulnerable to its neighbors, so the city-state republics were designed to mitigate potential conflicts at home. Greek society was always extremely fractured, so conflict at home was almost as common as conflicts between neighboring states. The structure of the aristocratic republic evolved in large part to mediate these conflicts.

Before the era of the city-states, Greek politics was tribal — noble clans battled each other for prestige and loot in the manner of Homer’s arrogant heroes. As settlements became more urban those aristocratic competitions frequently turned into civil war fought by tribal armies. The city state era’s great achievement was to funnel that endless aristocratic competition into the political arena: instead of cattle-raids and kidnappings, rival aristocrats competed for votes. The _laos_ , the armed citizenry, acted as referee: even though an ordinary spearman might never be able to be a magistrate he could back one candidate over another, or approve a verdict in a politically charged trial.

In most Greek states aristocrats retained important hereditary advantages. Sometimes these were based on tribal traditions, sometimes on religious sanctions, and sometimes simply by wealth. Generally speaking exposure to commerce tended to erode hereditary privilege and replace it with privilege based on wealth — but even in democratic, commercial Athens a genealogy which included a few gods and heroes was a significant social and political asset. Nevertheless, the combination of voting rights and and jury participation offered to the _laos_  ensured that the rank-and-file of the vital infantry were at least somewhat included in community decision making. Typically the capstone of the political process was an __assembly__ or _[ecclesia](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ecclesia-ancient-Greek-assembly)_ _*,_ an open-air mass meeting where matters were debated in front of the citizenry_._  The assembly was typically convened for matters of broad communal importance: to debate matters of war and peace, to deal with emergencies, and (in places where magistracies were elective) to vote.

The armed citizenry got to vote — but all voting was not necessarily equal. More oligarchical cities found a variety of ways to dilute the real power of the less privileged: gerrymandering by kinship group, by wealth, or by place of residence were common tricks to protect elite interests. Voting was usually public — which meant that a less wealthy citizen might be casting his vote under the eye of his landlord or his powerful neighbor. Mechanisms for secret ballots — which ranged from writing on potsherds to dropping colored beans in a jar — were a staple of progressive measures in Greek politics.

Not everything, of course, works well in open meeting of several thousands. Administrative matters were typically handled by a smaller group, the __council__ or _“_ _[boule](https://www.britannica.com/topic/boule-ancient-Greek-council)_ _”_ . It’s job was to oversee routine matters and often to prepare the agenda for meetings of the full _ecclesia._ The _boule_  (or sometimes, the _gerousia,_ “the senior citizens”) might be hereditary, or it might be composed (like the Roman Senate) of current and former magistrates.

The council typically doubled as the jury in a __court of justice__ . Civil law — controlling inheritance and ownership of property — was a central focus of social conflict: in a society where agriculture was wealth but where agriculture was often very dicey, it was common for poorer citizens to fall victim to predatory lending practices and land grabs by the powerful. A fair court system, therefore, was regarded as one of the key markers of a just regime. In that connection, one of the key achievement of the city-state was the creation of written law codes: the laws were rarely egalitarian but the mere fact that they were literally set in stone was an important check on the power of the aristocrats. Over time, as populations grew and litigation became more common and more complex, most cities ended up with separate courts. The social composition of the juries was one of the key indices of political inclusion: exclusive control over the courts was a hallmark of the most reactionary oligarchies.

Finally there were the __magistrates__ — the [archons](https://www.britannica.com/topic/archon-ancient-Greek-magistrate) — who handled executive duties. These could range from could range from leading an army to to conducting an embassy to overseeing weights and measures.** In most cities these were elected to fixed terms, but in some places they were elected for life or the office was hereditary. Almost every magistracy involved religious as well as secular duties; offering sacrifice and overseeing traditional observances were seen as critical to the well being of the city; sometimes magistracies were restricted to certain clans or statuses due to traditional religious constraints. Even in ultra-democratic Athens, the _archon basileus_  or “king magistrate” was responsible for carrying out the ritual duties which had, in the dim mists of the pasts, been done by the long vanished kings of Attica.

One notable feature of the magistracies is that they were often privately funded. Most Greek cities had minimal infrastructure and shaky tax regimes — so tasks that would seem to us like obvious “government responsibilities” were frequently farmed out to the private resources of individual magistrates, a system known as _leitourgeia (_ “work on behalf of the _laos_ ”). This could range from being an ambassador — a nobleman with a pre-existing family relationship in a foreign city might be sent to negotiate a treaty — to privately outfitting a new warship or paying for the the construction of a new temple. The _leitourgeia_  were in one sense an ultra-progressive form of taxation — but in another sense they were a means of limiting political power to the ultra-wealthy.

__The One__ 

The delicate balance of power which sustained an oligarchy or a republic was always in doubt.

Greece had several periods in which aristocratic competition outweighed class solidarity: one or another ambitious aristocrat managed to remove his competitors and become sole ruler. In our sources these self-made monarchs are known as ___tyrants___ _._ It’s a word which has negative connotations today mostly thanks to the fact that most of our written sources usually represent an aristocratic point of view. The tyrant who managed to leverage his popularity with ordinary people to monopolize power was every aristocrat’s worst nightmare, though of course it was also often their secret dream as well.

Tyrants were usually aristocrats who courted popular support to marginalize other aristocrats. They might be military heroes, populist reformers, or just particularly successful gangsters. A handful of those who achieved sole power became folk heroes for their successful reforms, like [Solon](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/solon/) and [Lycurgus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycurgus_of_Sparta) (both of whom, notably, voluntarily retired from their absolute positions). Others, like [Phalaris](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/phalaris/) and became bywords for cruel and capricious behavior.

As a practical matter the rule of a tyrant was typically dependent on a mix of popular support and mercenary soldiers. The populist element in tyranny varied very considerably and had a lot to do with local history. For example one famous tyrant was [Cleisthenes Of Sicyon, ](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cleisthenes-of-Sicyon)who rose to power by championing the Ionian-speaking part of the city’s populace against the Dorian-speakers who dominated the city’s aristocracy. On the other hand [Peisistratos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peisistratos), who was tyrant of Athens for three different stints, started off as a populist representing the rural poor —- however he finally stabilized his position by reaching an accommodation with factions within the aristocracy.

In generally, Greek tyranny was seen (by our aristocratic-leaning sources) as an illegitimate interruption in the proper form of government — it was “bad” in the same way that oligarchy was “bad”. There were a also handful of __legitimate monarchies__ in the Greek world as well which didn’t have the same stigma. In Greek a pro-social royal government is a “_basilea_ ”, from the word for king. However there were not many examples. Hereditary monarchy tended to survive only on the fringes of the Greek world — in semi-civilized borderlands like [Epirus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epirus_(ancient_state))and [Macedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)), or in overseas colonies like [Cyrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrene,_Libya) where the descendants of the original founder retained power down to the age of Alexander.

For a long time the heartland of Greek tyranny was Persian-occupied Asia Minor, where a tyrant could act as a de-facto Persian governor and could rely on Persian backing. However after several of the tyrants joined the great [Ionian Revolt](https://www.britannica.com/event/Ionian-revolt) (499–493) the Persians ended up embracing democracy for their Greek subjects — mostly on the grounds that it was a lot easier for a single tyrant to plot against the Great King than it would be for a politically fractured democratic government.

Greek monarchies (whether tyrannies or hereditary kingships) frequently retained structural of mainstream aristocratic republics. In Macedon, for example, the army traditionally functioned as an assembly and a court, though (like many Macedonian institutions) its “rights” were maintained as much by the threat of force as by law. There was also a council, similar to the republican _boule,_ though often addressed as something like the “the King’s friends.” Monarchies themselves were often quasi-elective: while the kingship might belong to a particular family or clan, the army assembly was frequently the arbiter between rival candidates, particularly when there was no obvious claimant.

The one institution which always distinguished a monarchy from a more conventional city-state republic was the existence of a paid standing army. Almost every classical story of a tyrant’s rise to power hinges on the moment when the ambitious would-be tyrant convinces the people to allow him to maintain a standing bodyguard on some pretext or other. In the classical era Greeks had a schizophrenic attitude about personal arms: while carrying a spear in the service of the city was the _sine qua non_  of being a citizen, actually walking around armed within the city walls was seen as barbaric, or at best a throwback to a more primitive era. Thus the presence of permanent, paid armed force within the city walls was one of the signal markers of a tyranny, the kind of thing that would make other Greeks shake their heads. In a more traditional monarchy the bodyguard corps was at least fronted by aristocratic “[friends](https://www.meaus.com/alexanderscompanions.htm)” of the king, which lent it a more properly civil air.

Sparta, interesting, had “kings” _without_ being a monarchy. Structurally Sparta is really just a variant on the typical aristocratic republic: real political power tended to lie in the _gerousia_ and the elected _ephors_ while the kings were essentially hereditary magistrates with military and religious functions.

_One difficulty we have in understanding Greek tyrannies is the fact that our written sources are usually quite hostile to them. This is a statue of_ _[Harmodius and Aristogeiton,](https://www.ancientworldmagazine.com/articles/the-athenian-tyrant-killers/)_ _who killed Hipparchus, the last tyrant of Athens, and became beloved folk-heroes for the rest of antiquity. Image:_ _[Josho Brouwers / Ancient History](https://www.ancientworldmagazine.com/articles/the-athenian-tyrant-killers/)_ 

__The Many__ 

Athens, of course, is famous as the birthplace of democracy. Our writers (again, with their aristocratic bias) are often very critical of what seems to us like one of Greece’s greatest achievements. In Greek, __democracy__ is more or less the _bad_ version of rule-by-many — it corresponds not to aristocracy but to oligarchy. The good version of popular rule is __polity.__ The Athenians often referred to their own system as _isonomia, “_ equality before the laws.”

The opposition between democratic and aristocratic regimes defined the classical era of Greece — the [Peloponnesian War](https://www.ancient.eu/Peloponnesian_War/) between Athens and Sparta started off as a fairly conventional game of city-state rivalry, but it spiralled out of control into an ideological conflict pitting aristocratic and democratic factions against each other all over the Greek world for more than a generation. This was no mere war of words: almost no part of Greece was untouched by civil strife as well as the underlying superpower conflict between Athens and Sparta.

Despite that, the democracies __still shared the general structure__  of aristocratic republics: a citizen body which was identical with the city militia, an assembly to debate important matters, a council to manage administrative affairs, and magistrates to run the city from day to day. The key innovations which distinguished Greek democracies from their aristocratic counterparts were _procedural_ and _social_ rather than structural. In Athens — the city we know best — we can actually see the gradual democratization of the standard aristocratic republic over time in the reforms first of [Solon](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Solons-laws), then of [Cleisthenes](https://www.ancient.eu/Cleisthenes/), and finally under the radical democrats during war with Sparta.

It was noted at the time that one key reason why Athens in particular embraced democracy is that the old equation of military participation and political power remained a force: as a naval power Athens depended on it seamen for survival. An oarsman who owned nothing but his oar still contributed to the city’s defense. He expected and was given citizen rights reflecting that fact: the navy was always the stronghold of democratic political allegiance in Athens while (unsurprisingly) the wealth cavalry-class _hippeis_  were usually suspicious of democracy and sympathetic to aristocratic regimes in Sparta and elsewhere.

The critical procedural marker of a democratic system was the substitution of __[sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition#:~:text=Athenian%20democracy%20developed%20in%20the,(typically%20of%20501%20men).)__ for voting. Magistrates were usually not elected, but rather chosen by lot. The system was intended to deprive the aristocratic minority, which could use social and financial pressure to win votes, of unfair advantages in access to public office. This meant that any free citizen could, in theory, be catapulted directly into public office without prior experience or political connections: a radically egalitarian approach to governance with few parallels in later history.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bcab37af0e292ead147c2e9bfeb04b3b)

_This is what democracy looks like: a_ _[kleroterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleroterion)_ _, a random-selection machine used by the Athenians to select the members of the council, jurors, and lesser magistrates._ _[This video](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6comzz)_ _shows a recreation of the machine in action. Image:_ _[Sharon Mollerus](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AGMA_Kleroterion_1.jpg)_ 

Obviously there were problems with an approach which did not even pretend to select candidates on merit. Typically the “candidates” were volunteers, and they were subject to a [routine investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dokimasia) before being allowed to enter the lots. A criminal record or a publicly-imposed limitation on citizen rights could disqualify you. Mental and sometimes physical disabilities could also bar you from office. In general, however, any citizen of a Greek democracy might, according to the luck of the draw, occupy most of the offices of state.

There as one more important mechanism to keep that newly minted public official focused on learning their job: at the end of your term you’d face [another investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyna). If the assembly decided that you had misused your authority you’d be executed.

The use of sortition was self-consciously radical. But even the most ardent Greek democrats felt there were some jobs where practical competence was too important to trust to luck. Out of the thousand or so offices in Athens, around a hundred which were elective — the most important ones being military commands and handling public finances. These offices usually ended up in the hands of wealthier, more aristocratic candidates. These officers too, however, had to stand face a potentially lethal investigation at the end of their terms; the old joke about the British hanging one admiral “in order to encourage the others” was more than applicable to Athens, which famously executed more than a few otherwise successful commanders.

The other key procedural change which the democrats made was shift the balance of power between the council and the assembly. In most aristocracies the it was the council which prepared the agenda for the assembly, so even in aristocracies where the citizen assembly had real power the council had the power of initiative. In democratic states, however, _any_  citizen could propose a new law or government action directly to the citizen assembly. In theory, _any_ citizen could initiate a new vote on _anything_ from a new tax to a declaration of war_._ This was the most radical imaginable expression of “equality before the laws.”

However serious consequences could attend on the decision to propose a law or another government measure. Just as a magistrate had to face a potentially life-threatening scrutiny at the end of his term, a citizen was liable for trial if his proposal was regarded as contravening existing laws. Prosecution for proposing an improper law could be retroactive — thus it was possible for a private citizen to propose a measure, see it become law, and then to be tried and potentially executed for having proposed it.**** Personal liability for the law ended after one year; after five years the law was regarded as permanent and now new proposals which contravened it were subject to the same system of penalties.

The possibility of legislation-by-prosecution showcases another critical way in which Greek democracies adapted the traditional aristocratic-republican formula: their approach to the __courts__ .

The council, which tended to be skewed towards aristocrats because it included those elected magistrates — lost exclusive control of justice, particularly in civil matters. Jury composition was always contentious, even in oligarchic regimes; in democratic cities this, too, was given to random sortition. In Athens, at least, jurors were paid — this made it possible for the less well off to attend the courts. Highly opinionated “professional jurors” who made a living by rotating between juries (both for the money and as a form of entertainment) were stock figures in Athenian comedy.

These independent courts had wide-ranging powers and were not constrained by procedural laws or legal finesse. In Athens there __no judges__ — while a magistrate would handle procedural matters the vote of the jury was based entirely on their personal interpretations of the law. The famous Greek art of public speaking evolved primarily in the courts, where the only test of a legal point was the jury’s reaction. This was equally true whether the case was a suit over a broken cart-wheel or an effort to reverse a politically charged law. Because the cases were often so contentious, the juries were very large — as many as 501 jurors — with the aim of diluting partisanship and getting a better cross-section of voices.

From our distant viewpoint, Greek democracy is in a lot of ways simply the expansion of the aristocratic republic to include more of the population. The basic institutions are retained, with the addition of random selection, regular rotation of office, and lower financial bars to entry. Ironically, though, by making the ordinary man into an aristocrat (at least, before the laws) the democratic regimes also encouraged democratic cities to restrict immigration and naturalization. In Athens, for example, it was almost impossible for anyone to become an Athenian citizen unless all four grandparents had been citizens — even the mighty Pericles, the most important politician of the day, [had to beg the assembly to grant his own son citizenship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles_the_Younger). It was entirely possible for a foreigner to move to Athens, but three or four generations later that family would still be _metoikoi,_ resident aliens. Citizenship could only be possible by a vote of the assembly. Manumitted slaves had no path to citizenship either. This ingrained exclusivity was an aristocratic inheritance in democratic states that was never really erased.

_This image shows one phase of the evolution of the Athenian constitution — you’ll note that it includes the three key pieces (assembly, council, and courts) but that they are almost all chosen by sortition rather than election._

_Here, the Spartan constiution (simplified). Despite the tremendous differences in emphasis the key parts — assembly, council, and magistracies — are similar._ 



__TLDR__ 

The Greek city-state had a very simple structure, and its three primary variations shared many similarities despite their obvious differences.

The __assembly__ — notionally representing the citizen militia — was the ultimate source of sovereign power: it was “the people” speaking as a body. In an aristocratic state the assembly was mostly expected to ratify decisions proposed by the council, dominated by the leading citizens. In a democracy, it was able to speak with its own voice. In a tyranny or a monarchy the assembly’s importance was a matter of style: a populist tyrant would rely on the assembly to overawe potential rivals, but one who ruled by force might not allow the assembly to meet at all.

The __council__ oversaw matters that required continuity and more deliberation than could be had in a mass meeting. In aristocracies, this might be a hereditary group or it might be chosen by wealth. In a democracy the council was chosen by lot.

__Courts__ were intensely political. Formal legal procedure was less important than the ability to move a jury — a fact which helps explain why the Greek education placed such a premium on oratory.

Apart from those basic institutions, Greek states were extremely simple. Complex administration and permanent bureaucracies didn’t really emerge until after the age of Alexander, when giant multinational empires became the power brokers of the Greek world. Classical Greek constitutional and legal arrangements were constantly open to renegotiation and change; in many cases a single well-delivered speech could upend the balance of power. The intensity of these debates made Greek society both incredibly dynamic and also remarkably chaotic.



_* For some Greek thinkers there’s a subdivision within “rule of the few” between regimes based on hereditary privilege (aristocracy and oligarchy) and those based solely on economic privilege (timocracy and plutocracy in the good and bad versions). Generally speaking the balance between hereditary aristocracy and timocracy shifted over time; by the Hellenistic period money usually mattered more than birth in most of the Greek world though of course they were often hard to separate._ 

_**The idea of a community forum like the went on to have a long afterlife — our “ecclesiastical” comes from the fact that the early church used the word for its own meetings._ 

_*** Weights and measures were a constant source of friction in an economy where barter was always important — there’s a reason why the ancient goddess of justice is depicted holding scales._ 

_**** In practice the usual penalties were fines or restriction of citizen rights (such as disqualification from office). The death penalty was rare, but real:_
