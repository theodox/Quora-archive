There are quite a few alternatives. Off the top of my head there's the Mayan system which was base 20 (and also included positional notation and a zero marker, both developed completely in isolation from our own Indian/Arabic derived system:

Plus it could be written with a much more awesome font made of little heads:

The Sumerians and their successor civilizations in Mesopotamia used base 60 for a lot of purposes. 60 is a good choice because it provides so many integer divisions. It survives in modern usage in the division of a circle into 360 degrees.

For similar reasons the Romans augmented their decimal number system with _unciae,_ "twelfths" . These are the ultimate origin of English _inches_  and _ounces_ (the Roman pound or _libra_  was 12, not 16 _unciae)._ A small vestige of this survives in the English usage of the _gross_ , which is 12^2 or 144 units.
