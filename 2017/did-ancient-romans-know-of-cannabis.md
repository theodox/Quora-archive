Indirectly, by way of Greeks. Here’s the relevant bit from [Herodotus](http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.4.iv.html) book IV, written about four centuries before Caesar, discussing the ritual aftermath of a royal burial in Scythia, the ancient name for the steppes north of the Black Sea:

> ..after the burial, those engaged in it have to purify themselves, which they do in the following way. First they well soap and wash their heads; then, in order to cleanse their bodies, they act as follows: they make a booth by fixing in the ground three sticks inclined towards one another, and stretching around them woollen felts, which they arrange so as to fit as close as possible: inside the booth a dish is placed upon the ground, into which they put a number of red-hot stones, and then add some hemp-seed.

> Hemp grows in Scythia: it is very like flax; only that it is a much coarser and taller plant: some grows wild about the country, some is produced by cultivation: the Thracians make garments of it which closely resemble linen; so much so, indeed, that if a person has never seen hemp he is sure to think they are linen, and if he has, unless he is very experienced in such matters, he will not know of which material they are.

> The Scythians, as I said, take some of this hemp-seed, and, creeping under the felt coverings, throw it upon the red-hot stones; immediately it smokes, and gives out such a vapour as no Grecian vapour-bath can exceed; the Scyths, delighted, shout for joy, and this vapour serves them instead of a water-bath; for they never by any chance wash their bodies with water.

Hemp was cultivated all over the Roman world, but Pliny’s [Natural History](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D19%3Achapter%3D56) mentions it mostly in the context of rope-making:

> … there is hemp, a plant remarkably useful for making ropes, and usually sown after the west winds have begun to prevail: the more thickly it is sown, the thinner are the stalks. The seed is gathered when ripe, just after the autumnal equinox, and is dried by the agency of the sun, the wind, or smoke. The hemp itself is plucked just after vintage-time, and is peeled and cleaned by the labourers at night.

> The best hemp is that of Alabanda [in modern Turkey], which is used more particularly for making hunting-nets, and of which there are three varieties. The hemp which lies nearest the bark or the pith is the least valuable, while that which lies in the middle, and hence has the name of "mesa," is the most esteemed. The hemp of Mylasa occuplies the second rank. With reference to the size to which it grows, that of Rosea in the Sabine territory [of Italy], equals the trees in height.

The closest thing to recreational uses is from the physician Galen’s discussion of the medical uses of different foods:

> Hemp seeds are used to create a sort of warmth and/or given to party guests to promote hilarity and enjoyment. Hemp cakes, if eaten in moderation, produced a felling of well-being but taken to excess they led to intoxication, dehydration and impotence.

However he distinguishes the hemp “tree” — maybe that big Sabine variety in Pliny? — from the Indian version:

> It is not the case that since the Indian hemp plant itself resembles the [aforementioned] tree, its seed is somehow similar in property to that seed. Rather, it is completely different from it, being difficult to concoct and unwholesome, and produces headaches and unhealthy humours. Nevertheless some people roast and eat it with other sweetmeats…. The seeds are quite warming, and consequently when they are taken in quantity over a short period they affect the head, sending up to it a vapor that is both warm and like a drug.”

These last two quotes are attributed to Galen’s [On The Properties of Foods](http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam033/2002031066.pdf), book I section 34 — but I haven’t been able to find the actual source in English (or even in the original Greek or Latin translation) online so I’m taking it on faith to some degree . In other works of Galen he does refer to the use of hemp as a painkiller for, eg. toothaches.
