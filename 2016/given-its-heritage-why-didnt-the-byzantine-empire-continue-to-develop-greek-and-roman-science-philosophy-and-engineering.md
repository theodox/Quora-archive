The Byzantines were acutely aware of their debts to the classical era — almost without exception our knowledge of Greek literary and scientific thought is due to the efforts of Byzantine preservationists and scholars.However, the kind of material they had to work with had an ambiguous relationship to technology and to “progress”.

In antiquity generally what we would call “science” and “technology” were only loosely related : thinking big thoughts about the nature of the universe was an elite activity for members of the educated upper classes; actually making things (particularly if you planned on selling them) was a grubby, middle class occupation that rarely figures in the literary record: for example the Romans made incredible advances in glass production in the first century, but there's scarcely a trace of those huge technological leaps in our literary sources.

So, a huge problem for the Byzantines (at least from the perspective of this question) was that the practical side of “progress” was often not written down — in an age without patent law an inventor had good incentives to keep secrets (and in an age without corporations, those secrets could easily lapse when a family firm fell apart after a generation or two). Moreover the uncertain times in which the Byzantine empire assumed its post-Roman character were particularly bad for “progress” in its technological and industrial forms: trade was being stifled by incessant warfare against the Arabs and the Slavs, urbanism was contracting as more and more people tried to live self-sufficient rural lives to evade the steep demands of taxation; and a powerful but erratic central state tended to crowd out private innovation in favor of highly regulated state monopolies (with a large dose of official corruption to render it even riskier).

Another important dimension of the Byzantine situation was precisely the survival of those ancient source. A lot of Byzantium’s self-image revolved around the great texts of antiquity (of Greek antiquity, anyway - by the end knowledge of Latin was at best a specialty for antiquarians and at worst regarded as subversive political activity). That is why he have not only the texts themselves but also the painstaking scholarly apparatus (like the [Suda](http://www.stoa.org/sol/), the great Byzantine equivalent of _[Who's Who in the Ancient World](http://amzn.to/2a2tL21)_ _)_ that kept them comprehensible. However that reverence for the past may not always have been positive: it tended to enshrine the authority of ancient authors a bit too reverently. If you’re familiar with the way [Aristotle’s dead hand impeded the development of physics in the West, ](http://www.vias.org/physics/bk1_05_01.html)and the overly submissive attitude of both Byzantine and Western doctors toward [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen), you can see how the Greek scientific canon became ossified and was capable of retarding new inquiry as well as stimulating it.

Still, Byzantium was never a completely static society: the [Paleologean Renaissance](https://books.google.com/books?id=8jA9AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PP2&ots=TI2oTSjjmV&dq=byzantine%20renaissance&pg=PP2#v=onepage&q=byzantine%20renaissance&f=false) of the 13th century, for example, saw a renewed interest in ancient science, mathematics and secular philosophy quite similar to (and intimately intertwined with ) the Italian Renaissance.

_The Alexandrian Greeks or Vitruvius had nothing to compare with the Hagia Sophia_ 

In any case there were many important areas the Byzantines did outpace their predecessors. Byzantine ships had lateen sails , skeletal frames and probably sternpost rudders, and could handily outsail their classical predecessor; the Byzantines also innovated in textile production, in architecture (no Alexandrian production remotely rivals the the [Hagia Sophia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia)), in applied chemistry (the famous ‘Greek fire’ - some kind of flamethrower) .

_Progress isn’t always positive for everybody_ 

One of the most famous Byzantine technologies illustrates neatly the complex interplay between technology, economics and society. Here’s part of the report of [Liutprand of Cremona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liutprand_of_Cremona), a western ambassador to the court at Constantinople:

> In front of the emperor’s throne was set up a tree of gilded bronze, its branches filled with birds, likewise made of bronze gilded over, and these emitted cries appropriate to their species. Now the emperor’s throne was made in such a cunning manner that at one moment it was down on the ground, while at another it rose higher and was to be seen up in the air. This throne was of immense size and was, as it were, guarded by lions, made either of bronze or wood covered with gold, which struck the ground with their tails and roared with open mouth and quivering tongue. Leaning on the shoulders of two eunuchs, I was brought into the emperor’s presence. As I came up the lions began to roar and the birds to twitter, each according to its kind, but I was moved neither by fear nor astonishment … After I had done obeisance to the Emperor by prostrating myself three times, I lifted my head, and behold! the man whom I had just seen sitting at a moderate height from the ground had now changed his vestments and was sitting as high as the ceiling of the hall. I could not think how this was done, unless perhaps he was lifted up by some such machine as is used for raising the timbers of a wine press

The Byzantines had clearly expanded on [Hiero’s engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile), a simple hydraulic device which the Alexandrian Greeks used to open temple doors as if by magic (it’s worth mentioning, by the way, that Liutprand is impressed but neither astonished nor terrified by this apparition. This is the year 949 but his only observation is “perhaps he was lifted up by some such machine as is used for raising the timbers of a wine press.”) The significance, though, is how it was used: not to increase industrial productivity or investigate the nature of matter, but in both contexts for propaganda purposes.

Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it serves the needs of a particular social moment. Without a vibrant middle class, a commercial economy, and a world view in which growth seems normal instead of one in which stability is the most cherished ideal the same information and the same intelligence produces toys instead of tech. The Byzantines very much followed in the track of their Greek and Roman forebearers in that they were [emphatically pre-industrial](https://www.quora.com/Why-didnt-the-industrial-revolution-occur-in-ancient-Rome-or-Greece).
