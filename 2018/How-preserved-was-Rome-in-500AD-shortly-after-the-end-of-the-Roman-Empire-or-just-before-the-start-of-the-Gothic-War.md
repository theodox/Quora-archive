The city had fallen on hard times, but it still had surprising vitality.

Rome underwent a major sack and depopulation in [410](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(410)) and another in [455](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(455)). The population already declined from its third-century peak: the [Plague of Cyprian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Cyprian) in the 250’s was as deadly as the Black Death,* and the (estimated) million Romans living cheek-by-jowl made for a terrible mortality. It’s no accident that the intensely urban culture of the early empire begins to center on the isolated country villa after the third century.

The two sacks and the plague accelerated depopulation in a number of ways. Beyond the immediate casualties, slaves and semi-free agricultural laborers took the opportunity to escape their bonds: the invading Goths, for example, swelled their ranks with escaped slaves. But for many the departure was involuntary — the city’s outsized population, even at a fraction of its old peak — could not be sustained without a vast importation of food from North Africa, Sicily and Egypt. The Vandal conquest of Africa in 435 disrupted the system, so for many the alternative to departure was starvation. The eroding market in Rome, in turn, began to undermine the North African agricultural system on which the city depended. The two trends fed each other, spiraling the city’s population downward towards its medieval nadir. While there are no solid numbers for the year 500, estimates hover in the range of 50–100,000 — a tenth or a twentieth of the city’s peak.

Against that background it’s not surprising that physical recovery from the disasters of 410 and especially 455 was limited. The imperial government in the 5th century was tottering from one disaster to another, so funds for major rebuilding projects were not easy to come by. More importantly, Rome was not really the capital of the western empire. While it retained symbolic importance, emperors after Constantine did not spend much time there. Western emperors adopted a variety of capitals of convenience in the fourth and fifth centuries; Ravenna, Milan, Arles and Trier all served that role for a variety of military and political reasons. The [cavalier attitude of the Roman emperor Honorius toward the Gothic invasion in 410](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging/answer/Steve-Theodore?share=20cb5c83&srid=zLvM), which can’t help but shock our sensibilities 1600 years, could be seen as simple pragmatism: with extremely limited resources, the emperor might simply have made a hard choice of substance over symbolism.**

The sack of 455 was particularly devastating to the city’s infrastructure, because the Vandals lived up to their reputation by sabotaging many of the city’s aqueducts (a tactic that would become even more common during the Gothic Wars in the 530’s). The shrinking population rendered repair a low priority, but this too fed into the downward spiral of urban density. The popes managed to keep some of the old lines functioning into the 9th century or so, but the mighty edifice of the old water network offered little beyond a standing lesson on the vanity of worldly glory.

Over the next several centuries much of the ancient fabric would be stripped for reuse — in a giant field of empty, decaying buildings there was no need to head to the quarry whether you were planning a new palace or patching up your barn. In 500 this trend will have been fairly new, but almost certainly in evidence. The Romans had a long tradition of architectural re-use — unlike us they were not shocked by the idea of ‘ransacking’ a ‘classical’ site to adorn a new building — much of classical Rome, after all, was decorated with the spoils of Greece.

On the other hand Rome remained an important center despite all of these depredations. The 5th century saw a number of new church buildings, reflecting the fact that the popes had become the effective rulers of the city as the empire collapsed. Many of these are not particularly impressive compared to the major works of antiquity but a few, such as [Santa Sabina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Sabina) (built in 423) are big and sophisticated buildings.

The churches — like the basilicas from which they take their styles — were the focal points of many community functions: not just worship but also judicial proceedings, bureaucratic operations, and social welfare support for the sick and the poor. They reflect the changing priorities of the Roman elite, which no longer had many opportunities for martial and political glory but still had avenues for public benefactions. The large church of [Santa Maria Maggiore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_di_Santa_Maria_Maggiore) — modeled very deliberately on an imperial basilica of the second century — sports the inscription _Xystus Episcopus plebi Dei,_ “From Sixtus the bishop to the plebs of God”. It reflects a full knowledge of the old Roman tradition of aristocratic display (and ‘plebs’ is a very deliberate, archaic choice) and makes a not-too-subtle statement of continuity with the grand past even in the straitened circumstances of the 430’s. The gold mosaics and abundance of (implied) precious stones also reflect the fact that even a diminished Rome could still make a powerful statement.

* We don’t have good statistical data for Rome, but the bishop of Alexandria in the same period gives numbers which sound like 60% of his city’s population had died or fled. Rome — more densely inhabited by far — was at least as vulnerable.

** Or, as I personally think, he might really have been the venal incompetent that he seems to be from our sources. Given his subsequent family history I think it’s likely — but not matter how you read the situation, 410 was clearly not a die-in-the-last-ditch moment for the empire.
