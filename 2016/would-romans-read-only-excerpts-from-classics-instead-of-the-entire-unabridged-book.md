Our word _[epitome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitome)_  comes from a Greek word that means, basically, “an outline” or “the highlights”.

This was a pretty popular genre in antiquity, since books were _very_  expensive. One of the reasons our knowledge of ancient topics is so unevenly distributed is that popular bits — in literature, history, and science — were excerpted freely and the copies for those fragments circulated widely. The more esoteric material, unfortunately, disappeared over time. In the later imperial period, when the economy was in steep decline, popular epitomes were extremely important for preserving pieces of works that few people could afford.

_A fragment of an epitome of Livy, from the_ _[Oxyrhynchus Periochae](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/livy/livy-the-periochae/)_ _, found in the Egyptian desert_ 

A few examples of antique epitomes off the top of my head would include [Florus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florus), [Orosius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orosius), [Isidore of Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville), and [Justin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_(historian)). In fine literature, collections of ‘good bits’ were known as [chrestomathies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrestomathy) and they were particularly popular in the Greek east. And , of course, there were plenty of excepts collected for schools — the papyrus-dumps of Greco-Roman Egypt are full of scraps of Homer, Pindar, and other authors regarded even back then as ‘classics’.
