I suspect in practice it would end up being http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game), although the rules governing reconnection of spaces would be more restrictive. 

Alternatively you could project the 4d space onto the 3d world and treat the fourth dimension as time, in which case you'd get at something along the lines of http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia:_The_Sands_of_Time
