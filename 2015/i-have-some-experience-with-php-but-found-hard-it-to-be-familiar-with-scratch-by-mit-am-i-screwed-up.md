Most observers would probably conclude that PHP is 'harder' than Scratch, but the hardness has more to do with how different systems communicate what's working and what's not. 

Visual programming environments can do real computing work, but they are also much more complex bits of application software than traditional text languages. You can write PHP with a lot of different text editors and get immediate feedback from a command prompt. To do anything interesting in Scratch, though, you have to learn the UI for the Scratch environment. While that is supposed to be 'easier' than a text interface it is still a new GUI to learn, just like Photoshop or GarageBand or any other GUI app it has its own quirks. And underneath it all you still have all the basic issues of any programming: logic, organization, and of course bugs. 


If you can accomplish anything with PHP you're obviously not dumb. You may have a learning style that's better at text than graphical stuff. You might want to jump straight to [Unity](http://unity3d.com/5?gclid=Cj0KEQiArK6lBRC5-_jv48uxgrgBEiQAuxdZ9Xr5Ea3bOF1r9wX5uQYJ82ACcUB38kGnSmEWGB8-RzwaAuws8P8HAQ) instead of working with Scratch; you're already past the fear-of-computers that Scratch is supposed to help young people get over.
