The age for entering the military was different in different places, but generally the it was somewhere between 16 and 18 years of age. Boys in that category were known as [ephebes](https://www.quora.com/Who-were-the-ephebe-of-Ancient-Athens-and-what-purpose-did-they-serve-in-Athenian-Society/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=39c93f77&srid=zLvM) (literally “coming out of _hebe_ , youth”) and were expected to learn the basics of military life. In the classical era the ephebes did around two years of light duty — scouting, guard duty and so on. After that they would become full members of the city militia, liable to call up in the full line-of-battle roles after around age 20.

After the time of Alexander, the traditional city militias became less and less important and professional armies ruled the battlefields. These were usually mercenary forces and so their practices varied quite widely.

Alexander the Great [commanded his first army at 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maedi), and led decisive cavalry charge at Chaeronea at 18. However in this respect — as in so many others — he was exceptional.
