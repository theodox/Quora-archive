I know for me, it's dampened my appreciation of a lot of things.

 Having an infinite amount of anything available makes it less special: if, for example, you like a particular genre of movie and you only see one or two movies of that genre a year, those films are special occasions for you. When a few minutes on YouTube can present you with hundreds or thousands of similar movies, you start to see all of them -- even the good ones -- as just _product._ The similarities tend to drown out the differences, making it harder to appreciate them as individual works and reducing them down to a simple consumer preference, like a brand of cereal or toothpaste.

The abundance of the internet does this to all tastes -- in books, music, movies -- and for me at least it definitely removes some of the savor of finding and discovering new things. It's easy to gorge on a specialty taste until you're sick of it and then move on, instead of appreciating things slowly against a wider cultural background.
