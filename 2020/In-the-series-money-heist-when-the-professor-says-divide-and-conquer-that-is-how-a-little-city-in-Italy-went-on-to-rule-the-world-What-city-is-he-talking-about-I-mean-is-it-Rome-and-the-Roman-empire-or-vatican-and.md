# In the series money heist, when the professor says "divide and conquer. that is how a little city in Italy went on to rule the world". What city is he talking about? I mean, is it Rome and the Roman empire or vatican and Catholicism?

It’s the empire; the tag line is [divide et impera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule). Ironically the idea is not supposed to be a Roman invention at all — it’s attributable to Philip of Macedon, Alexander the great’s father… who was very good at it.
