Thereâ€™s no original source that says so. The dates are approximately correct (Caesar would have been doing military service during the Servile War) but its more likely that he served in the east, since we know he spent time at the court of Nicomedes of Bithynia and was captured by Cilician pirates in roughly this time period.
