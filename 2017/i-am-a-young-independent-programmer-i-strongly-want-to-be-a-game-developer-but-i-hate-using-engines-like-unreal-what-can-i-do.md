If you’re serious about rolling your own, you should catch up with Casey Muratori’s [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/) website and videos — it’s a effort to build a game from the ground up using nothing but C. Casey’s a very talented programmer with a great track record and he does new episodes on Twitch where he takes questions. There’s a also a community of hands-on, bottom-up developers that hang out on the forums. If you really, really want to do it from scratch, that’s the community for you.

Be warned, however, that this is what programmers call a _non-trivial_  enterprise.



_Hand Made Hero day 337._ 

An engine like Unreal or Unity represents several hundred person-years worth of development time. Even a bare-bones framework for bottom up development will take you a couple of years at a minimum, and is unlikely to be as good or as reliable (much less as full-featured) as the big commercial products. And you won’t be distracted from making your game by wrestling with the engine: you’ll be distracted from making your game by the need to build the tools and tech you need — from image loaders to audio playback controls to framerate-independent keyboard input. The odds that you’ll finish a game engine, a tool set, and a game by your self are almost zero

You literally cannot imagine how much work goes into a modern engine. Unreal’s source code is about 2.5 million lines (not counting all the code you don’t see, for things like the FBX SDK, the audio libraries, etc). The usual estimate (it’s BS, but it’s the usual estimate) is 10–12 lines of code per developer per day. Do that math.
