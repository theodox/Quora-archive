# Why would the Roman Republic make a tribe or country all slaves (Greeks and Gauls for example) when they made others like the Jews (Judea) and Egyptians (Egypt) a vassal of Rome instead?

There’s really no examples of an entire people being enslaved, unless perhaps you count what happened after the battle of [Aquae Sextiae,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aquae_Sextiae) when Marius enslaved all of the survivors on the battlefield. That was a very unusual case, since it was an entire people on the move at once — the capture of the enemy baggage train involved the capture of the whole enemy civilian population.

Ordinarily, it was simpler and more cost effective to install a reliable friendly ruler to protect Roman interests. Even from a purely self-interested point of view, an intact society with its fields being farmed to raise tribute money and its manpower available for service as Roman allies was a better bargain than a mass of slaves. There’s more detail in [Roman Empire: What decided whether a conquered people became citizens or slaves?](https://www.quora.com/Roman-Empire-What-decided-whether-a-conquered-people-became-citizens-or-slaves/answer/Steve-Theodore)

Large scale enslavement generally only happened in cases where an enemy was unwilling to cut any kind of a deal and when resistance was particularly stubborn. It was almost always tied to the capture of cities which refused to surrender. You can see this pretty clearly in the way that the Third Punic War played out: the survivors of the city of Carthage itself, which was defended stubbornly for more than two years, were all enslaved — however the Punic cities like Utica which surrendered early were spared. The new Roman province of Africa remained Punic in language and culture for many centuries after Carthage’s destruction.

One important question from Roman standpoint was the stability and reliability of the client kings they wanted to safeguard their interests. The problem with the use of allies, rather than direct rule, was that allied kings sometimes decided to seek support from Rome’s enemies, or failed to maintain order in regions where the Romans worried about their strategic interests. A client kingdom which wasn’t able to keep its house in order was liable to be “provincialized” — that is, turned into a directly administered province. That’s what eventually happened in Judea, although in the imperial rather than the Republican era: the client dynasty dissolved in a frenzy of in-house assassinations and political instability, leading to the installation of a Roman governor in 6 CE.

Egypt was a special case: the Romans retained most of the existing governmental structure but the Roman emperors simply replaced the existing Ptolemaic kings. The economic importance of Egypt meant that emperors held on to the administration of Egypt as more or less a personal, rather than a national, possession.
