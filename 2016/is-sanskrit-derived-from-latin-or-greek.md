No, although they share a common ancestry. The usual theory — based on reconstructed sound shifts and literary data — is that the common ancestor dates back around 8 or 9 thousand years and has been splitting and evolving ever since.

There are several competing versions of the ‘family tree’ of languages, but the usual theory is that Sanskrit derives from the ‘Indo-Iranian’ branch of the Indo-European tree, sharing an intermediate ancestor with Persian and Avestan. Greek occupies its own (‘Hellenic’) branch and Latin sits on the Italic branch along with several other lost Italian languages. Here’s a decent, though pretty simplified, graphic representation of the family tree:

The center (“PIE” or Proto-Indo-European) represents about 8000 years ago and successive rings are rough approximations of 1000 year intervals over the last 5000 years. As you can see the Greek/Latin/Sanskrit split is at least about 5000 years in the past.
