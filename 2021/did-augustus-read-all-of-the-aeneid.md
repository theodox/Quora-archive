He probably did — for a given value of “all.” But it’s a bit more complex than it might seem.

Virgil’s fourth century biographer, [Aelius Donatus](http://the biography by Aelius Donatus (http://virgil.org/vitae/)) — relying heavily on Suetonius, writing two generations after Augustus and Virgil — tells us specifically that Virgil personally read second, fourth and sixth books to Augustus (and to Octavia, who fainted at VI.688, which mentioned her deceased son [Marcellus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus_(nephew_of_Augustus))) . Augustus corresponded with Virgil from as far away as Spain, and had pestered Virgil to see drafts of the poem in its infancy. So, it’s quite likely that he read everything he could.

The great question — the one that turns it into a philosophical puzzle — is _what did Augustus think he was reading_ ? An almost-perfect piece of art? Or one that was tragically, tantalizingly unfinished?

The ending of the Aeneid has been a puzzle to many readers for two millennia. The poem generally presents a calm, disciplined surface — the kind of mannered approach that one might call “Augustan” if it were not for the context of the question. But… the climax of the poem is this, the end of Aeneas’ duel with Turnus:

> Aeneas stood, fierce
in his armour, his eyes flickered, and he held back his hand:
and even now, as he paused, the words began to move him
more deeply, when high on Turnus’s shoulder young Pallas’s
luckless sword-belt met his gaze, the strap glinting with its familiar
decorations, he whom Turnus, now wearing his enemy’s emblems
on his shoulder, had wounded and thrown, defeated, to the earth.

> As soon as his eyes took in the trophy, a memory of cruel grief,
Aeneas, blazing with fury, and terrible in his anger, cried:
‘Shall you be snatched from my grasp, wearing the spoils
of one who was my own? Pallas it is, Pallas, who sacrifices you
with this stroke, and exacts retribution from your guilty blood.’

> So saying, burning with rage, he buried his sword deep
in Turnus’s breast: and then Turnus’s limbs grew slack
with death, and his life fled, with a moan, angrily, to the Shades.

That’s literally the end… Aeneas, the model of stoic dignity and good intentions, loses his temperature and kills a helpless defeated enemy. It’s almost the perfect inversion of the Iliad, where Achilles the remorseless killing machine shares a moment of mortal intimacy with Priam.

And it’s really puzzling in the context of the poem as a whole, which is usually so well behaved. The stark contrast in tone between the patriotic, go-team atmosphere of most of the poem and the sudden dark turn at the end has been a fertile ground for arguments: as [Barbara Weiden Boyd](https://www.bowdoin.edu/profiles/faculty/bboyd/index.html) put it, “No single scene in Latin literature has proved to be as great an ideological battleground as the end of the _Aeneid._ ” Modern readers of the Aeneid [frequently see its patriotic rhetoric in tension with darker undertones](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/is-the-aeneid-a-celebration-of-empire-or-a-critique): a critique of civil war and of empire which might not have gone down well with Augustus and his court. The abrupt ending is often a key part of the “critical Virgil.”

Did it raise an eyebrow with Augustus, whose early career as an avenger had been anything but serene?

Probably not: Augustus knew the poem was not actually _finished._ 

According to Donatus, Virgil was planning to spend three whole years revising the poem before publishing. However he fell ill after at trip to Greece (he met Augustus in Athens) and died of a fever — frantically demanding that the unfinished poem be destroyed since he would never be able to complete it to his own exacting standards:

> Before leaving Italy, Virgil arranged with Varius to burn up the _Aeneid_  if something should befall him; but [Varius] had insisted that he would not do so. Wherefore, when his health was failing, [Virgil] demanded his scroll-cases earnestly, intending to burn them up himself; but since no one stepped forward, it was to no purpose, even though he gave precise stipulations in this matter. For the rest, he committed his writings to the aforementioned Varius and Tucca, on the condition that they publish nothing which he himself had not revised. Nonetheless, Varius published them, acting under the authority of Augustus. But they were revised only in a cursory fashion, so that if there were any unfinished lines, he left them unfinished.

_[Donatus, Vita Virgilii 39ff](http://. Before leaving Italy, Virgil arranged with Varius to burn up the Aeneid if something should befall him; but [Varius] had insisted that he would not do so. Wherefore, when his health was failing, [Virgil] demanded his scroll-cases earnestly, intending to burn them up himself; but since no one stepped forward, it was to no purpose, even though he gave precise stipulations in this matter. 40. For the rest, he committed his writings to the aforementioned Varius and Tucca, on the condition that they publish nothing which he himself had not revised. 41. Nonetheless, Varius published them, acting under the authority of Augustus. But they were revised only in a cursory fashion, so that if there were any unfinished lines, he left them unfinished.1 )_ 

You’ll note that, in this account, it’s Augustus who sponsors the released of the Aeneid. In fact, Donatus quotes a poem (it [actually survives in the Latin Anthology](https://archive.org/details/anthologialatina01buecuoft/page/132/mode/2up)) which he believes to have been written by Augustus himself, on the dilemma this posed: to respect the sanctity of a dying man’s will? Or to destroy a great work of art?

> So then, could that voice, with the loftiest of words, have done something so wicked,
Commanded something so unspeakably cruel? Shall it go, therefore, into the flames,
Shall learned Virgil's great poem fall silent?

> […..]

> But we must be faithful to preserve the law; his last wish,
What he commanded, what he ordered to be done, must be obeyed!
Rather let the venerable power of the law be broken,
Than that his accumulated labors, days and nights,
One day should consume....

[Latin Anthology 672](https://archive.org/details/anthologialatina01buecuoft/page/132/mode/2up)

The authenticity of Augustus’ authorship has long been debated — but at least since the fourth century the tradition has been that Augustus personally made sure that the Aeneid was rescued from the flames and shared abroad.

One result is a large number of minor mistakes scattered around the whole poem (a roundup [here](https://latin.stackexchange.com/questions/1487/why-is-virgils-aeneid-considered-incomplete))). Variant editions circulated in antiquity, including swapped books and “helpful” emendations by lesser poets. The the slightly paradoxical text we have is tribute to Virgil’s prestige: in the end nobody wanted anyone else to finish the work.

The other result is imponderable: _what are we missing_ ? And how does the possibility that we are reading an unfinished work affect the way we read it? Is the dark undertone we think we see, especially in the later half of the book, just an artifact of incomplete editing? Is it a revelation of Virgil’s real thoughts which he’d have papered over with future emendations? An unconscious undercurrent which no-one noticed at the time? I think the last, at least, is unlikely — when Virgil spoke his contemporaries listened. But what ran through the mind of Augustus the avenger when reading those bleak final lines?

> … Ast illi solvuntur frigore membra
vitaque cum gemitu fugit indignata sub umbras.
