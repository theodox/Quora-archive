# Why did Alexander have to make the long journey to Siwa, which is out of his way to Persia? How can he know the outcome if he just improvised?

It was no accident. It was brilliant stagecraft, coming at the end of a long and complex history of Greek-Egyptian relations. There are two main things that play into the choice of Siwa

_Alexander as Amun, with ram’s horns._ 

__Courting the Egyptians.__ 

In general, the Persians get pretty decent marks as conquerors: their yoke was pretty light, and their attitude fairly tolerant. The exception was their relationship with Egypt. To some degree the fault lies with [Cambyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambyses_II), who comes across in our sources as kind of a nut (there’s probably a lot of source bias there: Herodotus, our main record, clearly gets a lot of his stories from vehemently anti-Persian Egyptian traditions). To some degree there was also Egyptian irredentism: the Persians had extinguished the last-ever native Egyptian dynasty, and the Egyptians never forgave them. However it comes about, Persian Egypt was never a happy place; [Athens](https://www.academia.edu/234203/The_rebellion_of_Inaros_against_Artaxerxes_I_and_the_Athenian_Disaster_in_Egypt_) and [Sparta](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/agesilaus-ii/) both supported Egyptian rebellions against Persia at different times.

So, Alexander’s choice of Siwa definitely fits into a deliberate strategy of courting Egyptian support against Persia.

__Egyptian propaganda__ 

Related to Greek political support for Egyptian resistance to Persia, there’s a long tradition in Greek thought of Egyptophilia. It may, in fact, hearken all the way back before the collapse of Mycenaen Greece — Homer often called the Greeks [Danaans](http://messagenetcommresearch.com/myths/ppt/Danaans_1.html), which reflects the legendary connection between the royal family of Argos and legendary [daughters of Danaus the Egyptian](http://mythics.info/english/mythology/danaiden_en.htm) — and, more historically it may be the the mysterious [Denyen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denyen) of the late Bronze Age. It might not be entirely coincidental that Alexander’s family, is (mythologically) related to the Argive royal house, although only through a maternal linkage.

Historical or not the Greeks clearly believed that Egypt had a major influence on their pre-history. Herodotus himself says that the Greeks learned the rudiments of religion from Egypt, and had no hesitation in identifying Amun with Zeus, say, or Osiris with Dionysus.

During the long Persian occupations, it seems clear that the Egyptians did what they could to encourage Greek belief in their kinship (Herodotus actually says, “I have it on the authority of the Egyptians themselves” when he says the Greek gods got their start in Egypt). So the Egyptians clearly leveraged that somewhat fuzzy mythological tie to try and court Greek support against Persia.

_This Amun-influenced coin is obviously similar to the famous Alexander-with-horns coins issued after Siwa — but it’s from the Greek colony of Cyrene, and predates Alexander by a couple of centuries_ 

__Why Siwa?__ 

The cult of Amun was a key part of this process. The Greeks of [Cyrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrene,_Libya) were enthusiastic devotees of Amun, who appeared on their coins at least two centuries before Alexander. There were [temples to Ammon in Sparta](http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias3B.html) and the Spartan port-city of Gytheion* and the kings of Sparta were particularly devoted to the oracle at Siwa.

_Nectanebo II, the last Pharoah_ 

The oracle at Siwa was the best possible stage for Alexander to announce his deity. It had been renovated and enlarged by [Nectanebo II ](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/nectanebo-ii/), the last Egyptian to sit on the throne of the Pharoahs — thus it was a symbol of both defiant Egyptian nationalism and Greek-Egyptian alliance. Contemporaries will not have forgotten that Nectanebo’s main military commander had been the wandering Spartan king [Agesilaus II](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/agesilaus-ii/),** and that the Amun cult was a key link between Egypt and Sparta’s royal house.

When Nectanebo was defeated by the Persians in 342 and fled into exile, the Egyptians never stopped hoping he’d return. It’s no accident that many Egyptians believed that Nectanebo was in fact Alexander’s earthly father (the mechanics involved are, to say the least, debatable — but the story was widespread enough to make it’s way into the [Alexander Romance](http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander1a.html) and subsequent pseudohistory). It’s important to remember that the dates almost work out: Nectanebo wasn’t Alexander’s father but he was a pharoah — reigning as a living god, at Siwa — when Alexander was a boy. The witnesses to Alexander’s pronouncement would have seen that as the obvious, critical backdrop of the whole affair.

Alexander’s journey into godhood is a [complex phenomenon](https://www.quora.com/To-which-religion-did-Alexander-the-Great-belong/answer/Steve-Theodore); it’s hard to separate out the personal from the political from the maybe-just-crazy. However the choice of Siwa as the place to begin it was eminently logical given the history of the time and place.

_This sarcophagus in the British Museum was made for Nectanebo II, though never used. It was brought to London from Alexandria under the mistaken impression that it had been Alexander’s —- a good example of how inextricably last Egyptian pharoah and the first Greek one were linked._ 

——
* It isn’t clear from Pausanias’ description when these were built, and one his stories is from the post-Alexandrine period — but given the bad relations between Sparta and the Macedonians, they seem more likely to date back before Alexander’s time.

** Agesilaius died in Cyrene in 359 BC. Nectanebo had him embalmed Egyptian style before sending his body home to Sparta — presumably the only mummified Spartan king.
