We use open source tools and projects all the time, and many of us contribute to open source projects when it makes sense.

However, we tend not to be enthusiastic about releasing the source of our games: we make our living selling software, and allowing anybody with a compiler to re-make it for themselves is a less than compelling business model. We already have major problems with cloners: many app store games, for example, are literally [renamed versions of closed-source copyrighted games](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/clones-clones-everywhere-1024-2048-and-other-copies-of-popular-paid-game-threes-fill-the-app-stores/). Making that easier for the cloners has no commercial appeal. 

Not surprisingly, we tend to prefer more permissive open source projects. Open engines like [Ogre](http://www.ogre3d.org/) and [Irrlicht](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/), for example, don't use the copyleft style, you-must-release-your-source-if-you-use-this. I once saw Bungie completely shutdown for a software audit because MS legal heard a rumor that somebody was using a copylefted tool, and the lawyers were afraid that this could put the entire Halo codebase into the public domain (as it happens the 'tool' was just an artist's program that never touched the code base in any way, but the lawyers are professionally paranoid about such things). 

Many game engines and related tools enter the open-source world when they are no longer commercially competitive: for example, the [id Software](https://github.com/id-Software) github publishes the source to older Doom and Quake series games.
