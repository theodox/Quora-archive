[Edward Conway](https://www.quora.com/profile/Edward-Conway) is right in suggesting that the right translation is usually “god”. However there are some contextual alternatives that are worth noting.

__“Heaven” or “The Divine”__ 

The deep proto-Indo-European root word is believed to be [*dyew-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Terms_derived_from_the_PIE_root_*dyew-), which means something like “bright sky” . In almost all Indo-European languages the word for God or gods is a descendant of that, from Zeus and Jupiter (via _dyeus-pater_ ) to the Hindu [Dyaus Pita](https://www.google.com/search?q=dyaus+pita+hindu+god&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjamv2g7dzXAhUI0GMKHagWC9cQ1QIIigEoBA&biw=669&bih=362) and the Norse [Teiwaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BDr) (Tyr).

If the context makes the ordinary translation awkward you can often substitute “heaven” for “God,” as is frequently done in translations of Chinese, such as “the mandate of heaven”. Greek (and Latin) writers often use the vaguer version in preference to the names of individual gods. However, capital-G God also works in most of those cases; as in modern Hinduism it’s often possible for speaker to switch back and forth between polytheistic and monotheistic habits of speech seamlessly (and it’s not a good idea to read to much into the switch).

Plato, for example, will frequently use that locution or sometimes τό θεῖον, which is a neuter substantive adjective which he uses to means “the divine” in the abstract. That kind of abstraction seems to be more common in later antiquity as well, particularly under the influence of Neo-Platonism.

__As an adjective__ 

θεῖος is the usual adjective for “god-like” or “divine”, but θεός sometimes doubles as an adjective, “divine” being probably the best English rendering (rather than, say, “holy” which has connotations in English that would be misleading).

Hellenistic and Roman kings often ascribed the title of θεός to kings, though almost no one took that literally as a statement of belief: it’s better read as a symbol of exaggerated respect. It could be used that way outside of politics too; for example, when the Jewish philosopher Philo describes Plato as θεώτερος (the ending is just the superlative form of θεός) he definitely does not mean that Plato is _a_  god. In some cases you can find Christian writers using this sense relating to, for example, Christians who have become θεοί by adhering to virtue: they have become “divine” — maybe here “holy” would work — but not deities.

In the Greek version of the Old Testament θεοί is sometimes used to indicate appointed authorities, especially judges, where the Hebrew has [Elohim. אֱלֹהִים‎](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elohim) (showing a different version of the one-many tension present in Greek). If you don’t know about that usage something like Exodus 7.1

> καὶ εἶπεν κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν λέγων ᾿Ιδοὺ δέδωκά σε θεὸν Φαραω

> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, behold, I have made you [theos] to Pharoah

becomes very surprising.

__Noun vs. proper noun.__ 

You’ll also run into a fierce technical argument about what to do with the definite article. It’s pretty common for the New Testament to distinguish between capital-G God and other uses of θεός by the use of the definite article: so ὁ Θεός for the Hebrew God, but θεοί πολλοί, “many gods” for angels and other intermediate beings at [1 Corinthians 8:5.](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/8/5/s_1070005) How much stress to lay on the presence or absence of the article is a hot topic among some kinds of theologians; if that’s what you’re trying to figure out there are plenty of links [here](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&strongs=g2316).

__TLDR__ 

As you can see there are a number of ways the word can be used, although this list may give a wrong impression of the relative frequency. Most often it’s just lower-case-g “god”. The ambiguities and ambivalences in Greek usage are not exactly an accident: they reflect deep ambiguities and ambivalences in Greek thought, any translation needs to be fairly cautious before laying too much stress on on any one reading of the word.
