“Right after” is more than a bit of a misnomer: the lapse of time between Constantine (312) and the collapse of the western Empire (476) is a bit longer than the lapse of time between, say, the French Revolution and the blitzkrieg. Just because the events are all quite distance the seem quite close in time _to us_  — but from the contemporary perspective it was a very different matter.

It’s even more of dubious correlation when you consider that the eastern half of the empire — which we label “Byzantine”, but which called itself Roman — lasted for another thousand years; in fact the Christian Roman empire (at 1153 years) lasted almost four times as long as the pagan version (339 years) and is longer than the period from the founding of the Roman republic to Constantine (509 BC to 312, or 821 years).
