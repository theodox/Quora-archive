We can’t be completely sure but it’s extremely likely that there are no descendants.

The only recorded child who might have survived his lifetime is [Caesarion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarion), Caesar’s son with Cleopatra. Most ancient sources claim that Caesarion was killed by Caesar’s adoptive heir, [Octavian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus), but a there were legends that he escaped to India with some of Cleopatras’s treasure. He is lost to history, but if he really did survive it is conceivable — though of course far from proven — that he still has descendants in India today.
