Not really.

The Spartans were not always the fiercest Greek opponents of Alexander. In the time of Alexander’s father, Philip, it was Athens under [Demosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosthenes) who tried to lead the opposition to Macedon while Sparta stayed more or less aloof. After his victory at [Chaeronea](http://www.livius.org/articles/battle/chaeronea-338-bce/) Philip forced most of the leading Greek city states into his[ Corinthian League](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/justin-epitome/the-corinthian-league/) - a kind of ancient Warsaw Pact consisting of unwilling ‘allies’. The Spartans, however, refused to join the league. There’s a famous story that the Philip tried to bully the Spartans into the alliance :

> … when Philip wrote thus to the Spartans: “If once I enter into your territories, I will destroy you all uttterly,” they answered him with the single word: “If.”

[Plutarch, On Garrulity, 17](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0288%3Asection%3D17)

In any event, they stayed aloof rather than contending openly with Philip and Alexander. When Alexander sent back the spoils of his victory at Granicus for display in the Parthenon he made a point of including this inscription:

> Alexander, son of Philip, and the Greeks (__except the Lacedaemonians__ ) dedicate these spoils, taken from the Persians who dwell in Asia

But that was the only penalty that Sparta paid for its isolationism.

Spartan policy changed suddenly in 333, when when the Spartan king [Agis III ](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/agis-iii/)tried to take advantage of Alexander’s absence to reassert Spartan power. At this point the war was still very much undecided; the Persian satrap [Pharnabazus](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/pharnabazus-3/) was trying to cut Alexander’s supply lines by controlling the Aegean, and he offered money and soldiers to Agis to open a second front in Greece.

The effort fell apart when news arrived of Alexander’s victory at [Issus](http://www.livius.org/articles/battle/issus/). But Agis was already compromised, having taken money and met with the Persians. He also could see that there would not be many other opportunities to stop the Macedonians. He invaded Crete in part as a buffer against Alexander’s fleets, and in part to use as a recruiting ground: the eastern Mediterranean was swarming with the remnants of Darius’ armies, in particular the large number of Greek mercenaries who had fought for him; Agis recruited these aggressively.

From the timing, it seems likely that Agis was happy to see Alexander bogged down at [the siege of Tyre](http://www.livius.org/articles/battle/tyre-332-bce/), which took place in 332 while he was occupying Crete. However, there is no evidence of coordination or communications between the two enemies of Alexander: they were co-belligerents, rather than allies. The Greeks of Cyprus had deserted the Persians and gone over to Alexander in the aftermath of Issus — their fleets and engineers were an important part of the siege of Tyre — so Cyprus sat square across the main line of communication between the Spartans and Tyrians. Agis’ main military effort -- the seizure of [Megalopolis](http://www.historyandheadlines.com/history-331-bce-battle-megalopolis-alexander-beats-spartans/) — took place after Tyre had already been destroyed.
