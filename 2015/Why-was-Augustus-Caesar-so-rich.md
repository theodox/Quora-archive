As [Gianluca Pica](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gianluca-Pica) points out, his private wealth came primarily from inheritance -- but not necessarily in ordinary economic terms.

Augustus -- though at this point in his life the title was still almost two decades in the future -- was Julius Caesar's adopted son and heir. The new heir ("Caesar" to his friends, "Octavian" to everyone else) was supposed to inherit 3/4 of Julius Caesar's considerable estate. We don't actually know how much that amounted to but we know that out of the _rest_  Caesar left 300 sesterces for every Roman citizen (the equivalent of 4 months wages for an ordinary working person!). So the amount of money that was due to Octavian was pretty staggering. 

However, the legal transition of property had to be ratified by Marc Anthony, who had largely stepped into Caesar's place when Caesar was assassinated and the tyrannicides fled Rome. Anthony -- correctly recognizing that a legitimate "Caesar" was a huge threat to his position -- refused to hand over the money. 

Here's where the non-economic part of Octavian's inheritance came into play: simply by bearing the mantle of Caesar, Octavian attracted support from Caesar's veterans and the legions that he had commanded personally: Octavian gathered up a private army (mostly unpaid, since he had never gotten Caesar's silver) and struck a deal with the Senate - which was looking for a chance to get rid of Anthony. When Anthony rallied the legions in Gaul and Hispania, however, Octavian abruptly switched sides, joining Anthony and Lepidus in the [Second Triumvirate](http://Second Triumvirate) , destroying once and for all the last remnants of representative government at Rome. Part of the deal allowed Octavian some portion of his legal inheritance, though again we don't know how much. More importantly of course Octavian now had a formal footing and a reliable budget for his armies. Much of this was funded out of proscriptions of political rivals (or simply those who had the misfortune to be wealthy and politically expendable).

When the triumvirate finally broke up in 32 BC, Octavian defeated Anthony in first at [Actium](http://Actium) and then in Egypt becoming the sole ruler of the Roman world. He set up a new system that kept military and economic power firmly in his own hands: although he kept a thin pretense of Republican government he retained personal control of the key military commands and also the most important provinces. In particular he treated Egypt -- the breadbasket of the Mediterranean -- as a personal fiefdom (this is slightly less odd than it sounds: the Ptolemies had essentially run the country as a vast private estate anyway; Augustus was merely replacing them as the head of the vast extractive machinery they had built).

 In theory the emperor (and his successors) maintained a private establishment distinct from the government and its revenues -- in practices Augustus and his successors felt little hesitation in moving money from the 'public' to the 'private' side of the ledger or the reverse as they found convenient. We know from the [Res Gestae Divi Augusti](http://Res Gestae Divi Augusti) that Augustus payed out over HS 600,000,000 from his 'private' funds for public projects -- we have no idea how much money flowed the other way.

Augustus' personal finances also benefitted from large inheritances , in particular from [Maecenas](http://Maecenas) and [Agrippa](http://Agrippa). Leaving a part of your estate to the emperor provided some political cover for your heirs -- in later years this would come to have a grim association since nastier emperors like Nero would extort a bequest from wealthy senators as the price of an easier death and the survival of family members.
