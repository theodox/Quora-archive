It’s important to remember that this is essentially part of philosophical dialog — actually, “religious” might be a more appropriate term. For Plutarch the key point is the cosmic vision laid out in the last chapters of the dialog. The narrator of this story (who is actually never introduced, unless Sulla discusses him in the lost opening chapter of the _De Facie_ ) is really there to impart cosmological truths; his authority derives from his origins in the land of Cronus and his access to its arcane secrets.

As far as the geographical details, they are a tightly knotted web of references from several sources: the legend of Atlantis, astrology, Homer, the myth of the Islands of the Blessed, and real-world voyages of the Greek explorer Pytheas of Massilia. It’s probably best treated as a kind of “head canon” — a bravura show of melding a lot of disparate references into something that’s at least superficially coherent — rather than a bit of actual geography. It’s extremely unlikely that Plutarch intended it as a travel guide.

Here are some of the key referents of the story told in _De Facie_ to help sketch out the key themes.

__Ogygia__ 

[Ogygia is the island of Calypso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogygia#Geographical_account_by_Plutarch) in Homer’s _Odyssey_ , which Plutarch’s speaker — places beyond the Pillars of Hercules, ie, somewhere in the Atlantic.

The Roman geographer Strabo (a bit more than a century before Plutarch) also [located Ogygia in the Atlantic](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/1B1*.html), though as part of a long discussion of the possible historicity of Homer’s geographical reference in which he is generally pretty skeptical of anything outside of the eastern Mediterranean.

Here, Sulla places Ogygia five days sail west of Britain; if there’s a real-world analog it’s either Ireland ([a possibility floated in the 18th century](http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&O=NUMM-074868)) or possibly Iceland — not a great match for the legendary Ogygia, but the source of a potential confusion with what the Greeks usually called [“Thule,” the farthest western part of the known world](https://www.quora.com/Was-Iceland-known-to-the-Romans/answer/Steve-Theodore). The notion that the sea beyond Ogygia is “muddy” and “congealed” does not come from Homer; it looks like a garbled version of the account of the Greek explorer [Pytheas of Massallia](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1078/on-the-ocean-the-famous-voyage-of-pytheas/), who visited Britain and the North Sea around the time of Alexander. His account of floating sea-ice, the midnight sun, and the northern lights was much commented on (but never, as far as we can tell, empirically tested) in antiquity. This would make sense if you identify Ogygyia with Thule — even though, as we’ll see below, Iceland is not necessarily a great candidate for the “Islands of the Blessed”.

__The great continent__ 

The Great Continent which lies beyond Ogygia is a reference to Plato’s __Timaeus__ and its discussion of Atlantis (in [chapters 24–25](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DTim.%3Apage%3D24)):

> in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together; and it was possible for the travellers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses that veritable ocean. For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak [= the Mediterranean] is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent

Plutarch was a dedicated Platonist, and quite familiar with the Atlantis story (he references it in his _[Life of Solon](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Solon*.html)_  as well, and says there that Solon also wrote a work about Atlantis based, like Plato’s on “Egyptian sources.” )

As far as visualizing the setup goes: Plato and Plutarch both have the great continent surrounding the known world — which is why the “stranger” quoted by Sulla describes the people of Europe as “islanders”.

In antiquity, as today, opinions about both the historicity and the location of Atlantis are said to be all over the map — though westerly locations were generally preferred; here Plutarch seems to be conflating Atlantis with the Islands of the Blessed, which were traditionally located in the west.

__Cronus__ 

[Cronus (or Kronos), the mythological father of Zeus](https://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanKronos.html), also has a long association with the west in Greek mythology. Most often he’s connected to Italy but here Sulla says he’s confined to one of the islands west-southwest of Ogygia by Zeus.

This is really a mixing of two different mythic traditions: in one, Zeus imprisons Cronus in Tartarus, but in the alternative version Cronus is demoted to ruling over the Islands of the Blessed, the “Elysian Islands”. Usually, Elysium is located in the underworld but in other versions (and here for Plutarch) it becomes the “[Fortunate Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortunate_Isles),” which are generally placed in the western Ocean.

The idea that the Fortunate Isles, Island of the Blessed, or some similar earthly paradise really did lie out in the western oceans was a pretty familiar one in Plutarch’s day. In his _Life of Sertorius_ , he has the runaway Roman dreaming of giving up his life as rebel and retiring to the islands:

> Here [Sertorius] fell in with some sailors who had recently come back from the Atlantic Islands. These are two in number, separated by a very narrow strait; they are ten thousand furlongs distant from Africa, and are called the Islands of the Blest. They enjoy moderate rains at long intervals, and winds which for the most part are soft and precipitate dews, so that the islands not only have a rich soil which is excellent for plowing and planting, but also produce a natural fruit that is plentiful and wholesome enough to feed, without toil or trouble, a leisured folk. Moreover, an air that is salubrious, owing to the climate and the moderate changes in the seasons, prevails on the islands. For the north and east winds which blow out from our part of the world plunge into fathomless space, and, owing to the distance, dissipate themselves and lose their power before they reach the islands; while the south and west winds that envelope the islands from the sea sometimes bring in their train soft and intermittent showers, but for the most part cool them with moist breezes and gently nourish the soil. Therefore a firm belief has made its way, even to the Barbarians, that here is the Elysian Field and the abode of the blessed, of which Homer sang

(Plutarch, [Sertorius, 8](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0062%3Achapter%3D8))

Sertorius’s dream islands are probably the Canaries, which were only tenuously known to the Greco-Roman world.

For a contemporary audience this would not be particularly surprising; other authors locate the Islands of the Blessed beyond the Pillars of Hercules too. However Plutarch is unique in mixing Cronus’ earthly paradise with a northern island like that in Pytheas where the midnight sun and the northern lights can be seen.

Plutarch has also combined the Cronus-as-prisoner myth with the Cronus-ruling-the-blessed-isles myth, since “sleeps confined in a deep cave of rock that shines like gold — the sleep that Zeus has contrived like a bond for him.” This becomes important later in the story, since the dreams of Cronus are communicated to the priests who taught the stranger about the fate of souls on the moon. A variant of this story is also mentioned in Plutartch’s _[De Defectu Oraculorum](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/De_defectu_oraculorum*.html#T420a)_ _—_ it might have been some kind of commonplace in middle Platonic allegorical thinking.

In addition to the story of Cronus as lord of the Isles of the Blessed, Cronus is also our planet Saturn (in Greek, Φαίνων or Φαίνοντος — it also shows up in the _Timaeus_ and Aristotle under variants of that name). So the inhabitants of “the continent” time their expedition to our known world when Saturn enters the house of Taurus — the thirty year cycle is dictated by the thirty year orbit of Saturn (it’s actually 29 years, according to NASA, but given the messiness of the Greek calendars that Plutarch was familiar with, 30 years is close enough for horseshoes and that figure was used by other sources as well).

The association of Saturn with Taurus and might also imply a Carthaginian connection. The Carthaginian Sulla says the “stranger” stayed in Carthage in part because of the city’s veneration of Cronus. Historically Cronus is the Roman Saturn, who in turn is the Carthaginian Ba’al. Plutarch may be thinking about the astrological symbol of Taurus:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4db513a0a337f1bfba4acca6473d45e1)

Which bears a superficial resemblance to a common representation of the Carthaginian Ba’al:

For symbolic reasons this might be an attractive one to Plutarch, providing important atmospherics for his ultimate point about the connection between the Isles of the Blessed understood as physically located in the Atlantic and the role of the moon in his vision of the afterlife.

__Astrology__ 

There’s a more abstruse astrological meaning as well. Greek astrology saw Taurus as the “exaltation” of the moon, the constellation within which the power of the moon to affect things on earth was greatest. Typically Saturn was supposed to be be the opposite of the Moon: it’s astrological profile was cold and dry, powers associated with death, while the moon was associated with fertility.

So, when Saturn occupies the house of Taurus, the powers of death are at their weakest. This makes a good transition point in the dialog, at the end of chapter 26:

> Among the visible gods​ he said that one should especially honour the moon, and so he kept exhorting me to do, inasmuch as she is sovereign over life and death, bordering as she does upon the meads of Hades.

After that point the dialog abandons geography and turns to death and rebirth in general, as symbolized by the moon:

> The statement concerning [Persephone] that now she is in the light of heaven and now in darkness and night is not false but has given rise to error in the computation of the time, for not throughout six months but every six months we see her being wrapped in shadow by the earth as it were by her mother, and infrequently we see this happen to her at intervals of five months,​ for she cannot abandon Hades since she is the boundary of Hades, as Homer too has rather well put it in veiled terms:

> But to Elysium's plain, the bourne of earth.​

> Where the range of the earth's shadow ends, this he set as the term and boundary of the earth. To this point rises no one who is evil or unclean, but the good are conveyed thither after death and there continue to lead a life most easy to be sure though not blesséd or divine until their second death.

Which returns us to the real point of the dialog: the process by which souls, after death, are purified of the “corruptions” which were inflicted on them by being associated with physical bodies. In this cosmology the moon is a kind of purgatorial borderland between the earthly world and it’s physical concerns and the true, eternal heavens beyond. The far side of the moon is “the Elysian plain” where the souls go to contemplate the highest good, symbolized by the Sun — an [elaboration of the idea in Plato’s Republic, 507](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy_of_the_sun)_._ The moon is simultaneously a physical place (the “face in the moon” is revealed in chapter 29 to be nothing more than topography but the moon itself symbolizes the endless process of recirculation by which unenlightened souls are returned to the earth while those that achieve enlightenment escape the cycle of death and rebirth.

Against that kind of backdrop it’s pretty clear that the geographical details that got us the whole story are self-conscious window dressing for this key philosophical concept. Plutarch threw a bunch of related ideas — Atlantis, the Elysian Fields, the Islands of the Blessed, the astrological potency of Saturn, and bits and pieces of practical geography — into a blender to produce a symbolically laded backstory for his interlocutor. But this was ultimately just set-dressing to lend some gravitas to his view of the relation between the physical world and its relation to the human soul.

The symbolism of the moon as a kind of cosmic way-station for deceased souls was very important to Plutarch’s version of the Platonic worldview, in which the spirt longs to escape the corruptions of the sublunary world. It figures, for example, in his _[Quaestiones Romanae 76](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/D.html#76)_ __ where attributes it to [Castor of Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_of_Rhodes). It may have been a common enough idea at this point (around the beginning of the second century) that it became a target for ridicule: Lucian of Samosata’s _[True History](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/true/tru01.htm)_ _,_ a generation or so later, uses a very similar setup to create a farce rather than a cosmic meditation. It begins

> Once upon a time, setting out from the Pillars of Hercules and heading for the western ocean with a fair wind, I went a-voyaging. The motive and purpose of my journey lay in my intellectual activity and desire for adventure, and in my wish to find out what the end of the ocean was, and who the people were that lived on the other side.

and ends with an interplanetary war between the inhabitants of the moon and the sun.

For what it’s worth, though, _somebody_ takes the geographical matters much more literally and thinks you can read this as a trip by Greek settlers in Newfoundland in AD 56:





Here’s the original text of the relevant bit of _De Facie_ (whole thing [here](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/The_Face_in_the_Moon*/home.html)). The speaker is the Carthaginian, Sulla.

> Well, I am but the actor of the piece, but first I shall say that its author began for our sake — if there be no objection — with a quotation from Homer:

> An isle, Ogygia, lies far out at sea

> a run of five days off from Britain as you sail westward; and three other islands equally distant from it and from one another lie out from it in the general direction of the summer sunset. In one of these, according to the tale told by the natives, Cronus is confined by Zeus, and the antique Briareus, holding watch and ward over those islands and the sea that they call the Cronian main, has been settled close beside him.​The great mainland, by which the great ocean is encircled,​while not so far from the other islands, is about five thousand stades [~550 miles] from Ogygia, the voyage being made by oar, for the main is slow to traverse and muddy as a result of the multitude of streams.​ The streams are discharged by the great land-mass and produce alluvial deposits, thus giving density and earthiness to the sea, which has been thought actually to be congealed.​ On the coast of the mainland Greeks dwell about a gulf which is not smaller than the Maeotis​ and the mouth of the Caspian sea.​ These people consider and call themselves continentals and the inhabitants of this land islanders because the sea flows around it on all sides; and they believe that with the peoples of Cronus there mingled at a later time those who arrived in the train of Heracles and were left behind by him and that these latter so to speak rekindled again to a strong, high flame the Hellenic spark there which was already being quenched and overcome by the tongue, the laws, and the manners of the barbarians. Therefore Heracles has the highest honours and Cronos the second. Now when at intervals of thirty years the star of Cronus, which we call 'Splendent'​ but they, our author said, call 'Night-watchman,' enters the sign of the Bull,​ they, having spent a long time in preparation for the sacrifice and the expedition, choose by lot and send forth a sufficient number of envoys in a correspondingly sufficient number of ships, putting aboard a large retinue and the provisions necessary for men who are going to cross so much sea by oar and live such a long time in a foreign land. Now when they have put to sea the several voyagers meet with various fortunes as one might expect; but those who survive the voyage first put in at the outlying islands, which are inhabited by Greeks,​ and see the sun pass out of sight for less than an hour over a period of thirty days,​— and this is night, though it has a darkness that is slight and twilight glimmering from the west.

> There they spend ninety days regarded with honour and friendliness as holy men and so addressed, and then winds carry them across to their appointed goal.​ Nor do any others inhabit it but themselves and those who have been dispatched before them, for, while those who have served the god together for the stint of thirty years are allowed to sail off home, most of them usually choose to settle in the spot, some out of habit and others because without toil or trouble they have all things in abundance while they constantly employ their time in sacrifices and celebrations or with various discourse and philosophy, for the nature of the island is marvellous as is the softness of the circumambient air. Some when they intend to sail away are even hindered by the divinity which presents itself to them as to intimates and friends not in dreams only or by means of omens, but many also come upon the visions and the voices of spirits manifest. For Cronus himself sleeps confined in a deep cave of rock that shines like gold — the sleep that Zeus has contrived like a bond for him —, and birds flying in over the summit of the rock bring ambrosia to him, and all the island is suffused with fragrance scattered from the rock as from a fountain; and those spirits mentioned before tend and serve Cronus, having been his comrades what time he ruled as king over gods and men.

> Many things they do foretell of themselves, for they are oracular; but the prophecies that are greatest and of the greatest matters they come down and report as dreams of Cronus, for all that Zeus premeditates Cronus sees in his dreams​ and the titanic affections and motions of his soul make him rigidly tense until sleep restores his repose once more and the royal and divine element is all by itself, pure and unalloyed.​

> Here then the stranger​ [never mentioned before in the text, perhaps introduced in the missing introduction] was conveyed, as he said, and while he served the god became at his leisure acquainted with astronomy, in which he made as much progress as one can by practising geometry, and with the rest of philosophy by dealing with so much of it as is possible for the natural philosopher.​ Since he had a strange desire and longing to observe the Great Island (for so, it seems, they call our part of the world), when the thirty years had elapsed, the relief-party having arrived from home, he saluted his friends and sailed away, lightly equipped for the rest but carrying a large viaticum in golden beakers. Well, all his experiences and all the men whom he visited, encountering sacred writings and being initiated in all rites — to recount all this as he reported it to us, relating it thoroughly and in detail, is not a task for a single day; but listen to so much as is pertinent to the present discussion.

> He spent a great deal of time in Carthage inasmuch as Cronus receives great honour in our country, and he discovered certain sacred parchments that had been secretly spirited off to safety when the earlier city was being destroyed and had lain unnoticed in the ground for a long time.​ Among the visible gods [= sun, moon and the planets] he said that one should especially honour the moon, and so he kept exhorting me to do, inasmuch as she is sovereign over life and death, bordering as she does upon the meads of Hades.
