The other big one is the siege of [Sestos](https://kosmossociety.chs.harvard.edu/sestos-and-byzantion/) in 479 BC. The capture of the city broke the Persian hold on the European side of the Bosporus and eliminated the last big Persian garrison in Europe. There were still other Persian-controlled cities in Thrace, particularly Byzantion (captured 478) and Eion (475) but both of these were smaller fights.

_Sestos dominated the southern entrance to the Bosporus_ 

Herodotus ends his history with the fall of Sestos ([9.114 -9.122](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herod/herodotus13.html)) and it’s traditionally been regard as the “end” of the war, even though there were mopping up operations and reciprocal raiding for several years to come.
