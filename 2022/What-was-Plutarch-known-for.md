He’s most famous today as the author of a very popular and influential set of biographies, known as the [Parallel Lives](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/home.html).

The _Lives_ are great read. The translation linked above, alas, is a bit stuffy (like many from the[ Loeb’s Classics Library](https://www.loebclassics.com/page/aboutloeb)) but even a clunky translation can’t hide what a canny biographer Plutarch is, which accounts for his enduring popularity down the ages.

_Sir Thomas North’s 1579 edition of Plutarch’s Parallel Lives was the inspiration for many of Shakespeare’s historical characters and for generations of writers looking for examples of ancient virtues and vices. From the_ _[British Library](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/norths-translation-of-plutarchs-lives)_ _._ 

Here’s a few famous anecdotes from the ancient world, all courtesy of Plutarch.

The Persians at Thermopylae demand that the Spartans surrender their weapons; the Spartans simply reply, “Come take them.” - Plutarch, Sayings of the Spartans

Aristides, known as “the Just,” was asked by an illiterate man to help him vote for the exile of a politician he hated: Aristides. “What has he done to you?” Aristides asked. “Nothing” was the answer, “I’m just sick of everyone calling him ‘the Just’.” Aristides filled out the form on his behalf. - Plutarch, _Life of Aristides._ 

Julius Caesar crosses the Rubicon, and knowing there’s no turning back he announces “Let the die be cast” - Plutarch, _Life of Pompey_ 

In Gaul, Caesar passes through a miserable little hamlet and looks around; “For my part, I had rather be the first man among these fellows than the second man in Rome.” - Plutarch, _Life of Caesar_ 

Socrates says he is not an Athenian or a Greek, but “a citizen of the world.” - Plutarch, _On Banishment_ 

Alexander the Great wept when he realized there were no more worlds to conquer - technically this is not what Plutarch actually said, but an [enduring misquotation](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2020/03/19/and-alexander-wept/) . Still illustrates that Plutarch popular enough to attract fake quotes five hundred years before there was an internet.

Plutarch’s biographies were unbelievably influential in the Renaissance and Early Modern era, creating many of the stereotypical images of ancient figures that still circulate today. Shakespeare’s _Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, Coriolanus_ and _Timon of Athens_  all base their characterizations on Plutarch’s psychological studies of ancient figures. The cold calculations of Augustus Caesar, Marc Antony’s infatuation with Cleopatra, the gruff philosophy of the Spartans and the wiliness of the Athenians — all of these and many more popular images of antiquity are all heavily colored by Plutarch’s writings.

The _Parallel Lives_ were considered essential reading in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Beyond Shakespeare, Plutarch was beloved by Montaigne, by Rousseau, by Goethe, by Hamilton, by Jefferson, by Madison… it’s hard to find anyone in Europe between 1600 and 1900 who was interested in antiquity who wasn’t cadging from Plutarch to some degree.

Heck, in Mary Shelley’s _Frankenstein_  even [the monster finds a copy of the Parallel Lives. ](https://www.shmoop.com/frankenstein/chapter-15-full-text-2.html)_“Plutarch” he says “taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.”_ 

Modern historians have a slightly more complicated relationship with Plutarch. Nowadays we are suspicious of the degree to which his philosophical leanings led him to rearrange facts to suit his moral tastes. We are irritated that he rarely cites his sources, making it hard for us to know why he so confidently characterizes events centuries before his own lifetime. He’s certainly capable of contradicting himself on matters of detail. So, we don’t take everything he says at face value.

But he’s still hard to escape.

Few biographers in antiquity (not too many in modernity, for that matter) can match the bold strokes with which he evokes a personality or his ability to find a telling anecdote. There’s a reason the Biographers International Organization calls their annual prize for biography [The Plutarch Award.](https://biographersinternational.org/award/the-plutarch/) Plutarch’s genius is always to make the alien and the ancient seem present and alive. As Goethe wrote

> “Was hat dich nur von uns enfernt?”
Hab’ immer den Plutarch gelesen.
“Was hast du den dabei gelernt?”
Sind eben alle Menschen gewesen.

> “What was it took you away from us?”
I read Plutarch over and over.
“And what did you learn from that?”
They were all _human_
