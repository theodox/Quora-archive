It’s the other way around — the Romans picked up the Greek habit of assigning divine names to the planets. However the Greeks. in turn. got that from the [Babylonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy).

For the Babylonians the five planets visible to the naked eye were

[Nabu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabu), the god of wisdom and literacy. The Greeks were not always consistent, sometimes assuming he matched up with their god Apollo and sometimes with __Hermes.__ Eventually Hermes won out. The Romans decided that Hermes was a good match for their __Mercury,__ so that’s were we get the name from.

[Ishtar](http://ishtar/), a goddes of love and violent empotion. The Greeks assumed the Babylonians meant their __Aphrodite__ . The Romans matched the Greek goddess to their own __Venus.__ 

[Nergal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nergal), a warrior god. He got matched up with the Greek __Ares__  and the Roman __Mars.__ 

[Marduk](http://marduk/), the king of the Babylonian pantheon, was a natural fit for Greek __Zeus__  and Roman __Jupiter.__ 

[Ninurta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninurta), a god of agriculture. He doesn’t have a good match in Greco-Roman mythology, but as a kind of predecessor to Marduk he reminded the Greeks of __Kronos__  and the Romans of __Saturn.__ 

The Greek and Roman traditions were around long before the habit of associating the god-names with the visible planets caught on. We are not sure exactly when the Greeks first started using the Babylonian connections, it’s probably some time between about 800 and 500 BC.
