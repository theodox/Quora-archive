There's not really an agreed upon date; many Byzantinists don't really like the term _Byzantine_  anyway, feeling (not always incorrectly -- see [Was the Byzantine Empire actually byzantine?](https://www.quora.com/Was-the-Byzantine-Empire-actually-byzantine?srid=zLvM&share=4e2cacd0) -- that it's derogatory) . 


Here's a few good candidate dates:

__476__ : the end of the functioning Western Roman Empire

__620:__ Heraclius officially adopts Greek as the primary language of the empire.

__730:__ The beginning of the [iconoclasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Iconoclasm), which accelerated the estrangement of the eastern and western churches, leading quickly to the collapse of the Byzantine exarchate in Italy. It's doubtful that any pope would have dared something like anointing a new western emperor before the years 730-787 

__752:__ The collapse of the [Exarchate of Ravenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exarchate_of_Ravenna) and the end of the East Roman foothold in Italy
