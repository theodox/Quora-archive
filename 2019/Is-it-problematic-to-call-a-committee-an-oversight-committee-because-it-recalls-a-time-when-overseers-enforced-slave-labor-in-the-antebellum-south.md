# Is it problematic to call a committee an "oversight" committee because it recalls a time when overseers enforced slave labor in the antebellum south?

“Oversee” has an interesting history that predates southern slavery by a long way.

There’s a thousand-year old Old English word [ofer-seón](http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/024223) which the same literal parts (“over” and “see”) but means something more like “survey” or “look over.” However _oversee_  and its derivatives begin showing their modern sense in the late 1300’s in both English and legal Latin. It’s not clear if the English word was translated into Latin, or whether medieval lawyers invented the Latin _supervidere_  (literally “over-see”) on their own and the English word got a new meaning from that.

In either case, by the 1300’s the person who ran a manor on behalf of the landlord was a _supervisor_  in Latin and the English _oversee_ had gotten the meaning of “run things”. For example here’s the [Pewterer’s Guild of London in 1348:](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/quotations?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=quote_everything&q=oversee)

> It be ordeined that iij or iiij moste trew & cunnyng of the crafte be chosen to ouersee the alayes and werkes aforsaide.

> It is ordered the the three or four most trustworthy and knowledgeable of the craft shall be chosen to oversee the alloys and works mentioned above

So, English was using “oversee” and its derivatives for “running things on behalf somebody else” long before the discovery of the Americas and the start of the Atlantic slave trade.

If the word recalls things, it recalls the fact that Indo-European languages use “see” as a general expression of the idea of knowledge, and so words with roots like “see” and “look” are everywhere in the vocabulary of organization. You can observe (!) this in the way verbs of seeing are baked into all sorts of activities: __Supervisors__ , it should be obvious, are just “overseers”; but __inspectors__  “look into” (_inspicere)_  things; __advisors__  “look at” (_advidere)_  them for you; even a __suspect__  is someone “under observation” (_subspectus_ ); and to judge them you consider the __evidence__  which “is seen out” (_evideor)._  Even “__Bishop__ ” comes from Greek _episcopos,_ a “looker-at”. The emperors of ancient Persia delegated their administration to “[The King’s Eyes](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/eye-of-the-king/)”. All of these words have close cognates in other European languages besides English: even in German an “overseer” or a “supervisor” is an [Aufseher](https://www.dict.cc/?s=Aufseher) (lterally an “on-looker”). The eye as administrator is a metaphor that’s buried deep in the history of European languages.
