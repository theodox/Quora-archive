No. The story that is commonly told includes a big, obvious chronological fallacy, detailed in this answer: [Did the Muslims burn the Great Library of Alexandria?](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Muslims-burn-the-Great-Library-of-Alexandria/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=5a942709&srid=zLvM)

The famous library was collateral damage in Julius Caesarâ€™s war in Alexandria, 700 years before the Muslim conquest. Not even the rubble of the original still remained when the Muslim armies arrived - the entire quarter where the library had once stood was leveled in fighting between the Romans and Palmyrenes in 279 and not substantially rebuilt because of the terrible tsunami of 365.
