You can simply save it out as a maya file of its own and import or reference it into scenes where you need it. Referencing ensures that lots of scenes always stay in sync, but it makes it a bit harder to make changes in any particular scene (everybody hates Maya referencing to some degree). Importing is effectively like copy-paste -- it's easy, but won't enforce any standardization if things change over time.
