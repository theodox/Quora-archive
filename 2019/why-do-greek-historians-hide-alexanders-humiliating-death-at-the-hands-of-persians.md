It’s rather difficult to hide something that didn’t happen.

__Babylonian sources__ 

If you insist on ignoring Greek sources, there are still Babylonian cuneiform documents. This one, for example, [records the defeat of Darius III at Gaugamela and the surrender of Babylon](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/oriental-varia/a-contemporary-account-of-the-battle-of-gaugamela/).

And this one [records the death of Alexander at Babylon in 323](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/oriental-varia/a-contemporary-account-of-the-death-of-alexander/). It even appears to include a mention of the story told by Arrian that the Babylonians advised Alexander to avoid entering the city by the Gate of Bel.

Both of which are pretty much exactly what you’d expect given the traditional Greek accounts.

__Persian sources__ 

There’s a less reliable Persian source in the form of the [Book of Arda Viraf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Arda_Viraf), a Zoroastrian religious text. Although the version we have was probably written down more than a thousand years after Alexander, it reflects a viewpoint which is profoundly hostile to him. It still says:

> the accursed Evil Spirit, the Wicked One… instigated the accursed Alexander, the westerner who was dwelling in Egypt, so that he came to the country of Iran with severe cruelty and war and devastation; he also slew the ruler of Iran, and destroyed the metropolis and empire, and made them desolate.

In the [Shahnameh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh), the 10th-century Persian national epic, Alexander is also depicted as a victorious conqueror ([although in that story he is also depicted as half-Persian and half “Roman”](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-evidence-that-Alexander-the-Great-was-not-European/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=d3251956&srid=zLvM)).

Neither of these sources has Alexander killed — humiliatingly or not — by Persians.

If for some reason you wanted to try to gin up a conspiracy theory about this you’d also have to come up with an explanation for [all of those Greek cities ](https://www.quora.com/How-many-cities-named-Alexandria-did-Alexander-the-Great-found/answer/John-Bartram?ch=10&share=54f71ace&srid=zLvM)and [kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire) ended up occupying the former territory of the Persian empire, which would remain in the hands of Alexander’s successors for hundreds of years — and the absence of Persian rulers between Darius III and [Arsaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsaces_I_of_Parthia). It will be particularly hard to explain away the fact that the capital of the Persian Parthian empire was [Seleucia](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-Seleucia-the-ancient-capital-city-of-the-Seleucids/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=0d8cf88a&srid=zLvM), named for Alexander’s general Seleucus, which retained its Greek language and institutions all the way through the Parthian era .

_A Parthian coin of_ _[Gotarzes II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotarzes_II_of_Parthia)_ _(40-51 CE). The reverse shows the king receiving a wreath from Nike (“Victory”), a traditional Seleucid coin design. The legend reads BAΣIΛEΩΣ BAΣIΛEΩN (“king of kings”) above and not very legibly down the left EΠIΦANOVΣ ΦIΛEΛΛHNOΣ (“the revealed” and “the friend of the Greeks”)._ 

Seleucus, incidentally, was married to a Persian princess named [Apama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apama) at Susa in 324 in the famous [“mixed marriage” ceremony which Alexander organized trying to unite the Macedonian and Persian elites](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/arrian/anabasis/the-weddings-in-susa/). This happened during Alexander’s return trip from India. Seleucus’s half-Persian dynasty ruled most of the former Persian territories for the next two centuries.

__Physical Evidence__ 

Lastly it’s a bit difficult to explain this coin:

If the Persians killed Alexander, did they wait until he’d marched all the way across their empire to the Indus Valley and fought their Indian vassals?

There’s a [different skeptical theory that claims Alexander’s Indian campaign was a defeat and not a victory](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-about-the-theory-of-Marshall-Zhukov-that-Alexander-had-been-defeated-in-India/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=8862e226&srid=zLvM). Both theories suffer from the same fatal flaw — they act as if the sparse written records exist in a vacuum. They don’t: Alexander’s career had innumerable consequences from Egypt to India, and you can’t simply erase it. There are hundreds of interwoven phenomena that derive from it which make no sense without the keystone.

I suppose you could try to add the Persians to the [list of suspects in Alexander’s death](https://www.quora.com/Was-Aristotle-responsible-for-the-death-of-Alexander-the-Great-given-that-Aristotle-was-furious-with-Alexander-for-killing-Callisthenes-Aristotles-nephew/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=1a58753d&srid=zLvM). Opinion has been divided for more than two thousand years on whether Alexander died of a disease, of poison, or whether he basically drank himself to death. It’s probably significant, however, that none of the ancient accounts which claim Alexander was murdered blame Persians for the death.
