# Are there undiscovered extant works of Greek/“classic” literature we expect to find in a dusty library somewhere? What might they be? Is there a field of scholarship actively looking for such?

Philologists dream of finding something truly unknown — but unfortunately such dreams only rarely come true.

The most common place for radical new discoveries is the Egyptian desert, where the dryness preserves papyrus fairly well. In recent years we’ve found bits and pieces of a number of otherwise unknown works — for example, the [Icheneutae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichneutae) of Sophocles and [a new poem by Sappho](https://www.thedailybeast.com/scholars-discover-new-poems-from-ancient-greek-poetess-sappho.html) (though that one is part of an [ongoing scandal](https://brentnongbri.com/2021/03/30/the-retraction-of-dirk-obbinks-sappho-chapter-and-the-question-of-authenticity/)).

It’s always possible that some forgotten tome will emerge from somewhere, but it’s very much an outside chance. For at least the last five hundred years scholarly careers have been by finding individual folios or even single pages, so most of the obvious places have been turned over many times by book hunters.

Even if something does turn up it might turn out to be a lost manuscript. The last five centuries of scholarship have had their losses as well as wins, so it might turn out that a precious “new” manuscript found in some dusty corner is in fact an already published one mislaid sometime between today and the 1400’s. There are, for example, several ms. of Tacitus’s _Germania_  which have gone missing since the Renaissance (and [the most famous one had to be hidden from the Nazis)](https://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2015/04/22/some-notes-on-the-modern-history-of-the-codex-aesinas-of-tacitus-germania-c/)
