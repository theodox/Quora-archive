It’s correct in the sense that (relative to the rest of the Roman period) it was a time of relative prosperity:

There were fewer large scale wars than in previous or subsequent centuries

The economy was developing rapidly because of the unification of the whole Mediterranean basin into a trading bloc with minimal interference from bandits or pirates.

Expansion of the cross-ocean trade to India was bringing new good and new ideas at a great rate.

However its also wrong in a typically Gibbonian sense — it simply ignores the experience of people Gibbon didn’t identify with, essentially, anybody who was not a classically educated male aristocrat. Some of the “happiness” he glosses over include:

Slavery remained the basis of the economy. Besides its political and economic dimension, Roman slavery in the Antonine period subjected millions of unfree people to the sexual uses of their owners. There were a few loosenings of the traditional owner’s rights during this era but for the most part, things we’d categorize as rape and murder were perfectly legal.

While mid-2d to mid-3d century Rome was prosperous, it was still ultimately a plutocracy in which the lot of the free poor was pretty tenuous — they had to compete with slaves economically and compete with the tremendously wealthy for access to good land. This was not an empire of prosperous peasant freeholders.

Peaceful for whom? Ask the [Dacians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Dacian_Wars) or the [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War) if it was a peaceful time.

Throughout this period, gathering in private home for private religious purposes was investigated by torture and punishable by death.

That the Roman state of the ‘5 good emperors’ was an improvement on its war-torn predecessors and the following century of endless civil wars is hard to deny. That it was an actual peak of human flourishing, however, depends a lot more on value judgements than on historical data.
