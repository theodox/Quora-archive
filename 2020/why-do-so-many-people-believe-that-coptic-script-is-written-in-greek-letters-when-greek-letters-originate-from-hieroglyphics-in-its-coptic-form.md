Actually the relationship between Greek letters and Coptic ones is… weird.

__Origins of the Greek alphabet__ 

The ancient Greek alphabet is pretty young. The oldest archaeological example date from the 8th century BC. This is one of the candidates for the ‘oldest example of written Greek’:

It’s the so-called [Nestor's Cup,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestor%27s_Cup_(Pithekoussai)) which was found in Ischia on the bay of Naples (at the time, a Greek settlement) . The decorations and stratigraphy of the burial where it was found place it around 700 BC. The other contestants for the crown of ‘oldest Greek inscription’ are from around the same time.

The letter forms are clearly derived from the contemporary Phoenician alphabet:

(Image: [Giorgios Bourogiannis](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Comparative-table-of-Phoenician-and-earliest-Greek-alphabetical-scripts-after-JN_fig1_331300441) ) Besides the obvious visual similarities, you’ll note that Greek retains variants of most of the letter names. In Phoenician these are meaningful: _aleph_  (the Greek “_alpha”)_ means “ox”, _bet (_ Greek _beta_ ) is “house” and so on. In Greek, they are nonsense sounds.

So, there’s not much controversy about the Near-Eastern origins of the Greek letter forms: [Herodotus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+5.58&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126), after all, says precisely that:

> The Phoenicians who came with Cadmus—amongst whom were the Gephyraei—introduced into Greece, after their settlement in the country, a number of accomplishments, of which the most important was writing, an art till then, I think, unknown to the Greeks. At first they used the same characters as all the other Phoenicians, but as time went on, and they changed their language, they also changed the shape of their letters. At that period most of the Greeks in the neighbourhood were Ionians; they were taught these letters by the Phoenicians and adopted them, with a few alterations, for their own use, continuing to refer to them as the Phoenician characters—as was only right, as the Phoenicians had introduced them.

The invention which the Greeks can claim for themselves is the addition of vowels: Phoenician (like Hebrew) only encoded consonants. The Greeks turned several soft consonants like _yod_  (“y”) into actual vowels like _iota_ “i”.

__Egyptian connection__ 

Even though the Greek alphabet is Phoenician, the Phoenician characters themselves had ancestors. The Phoenician script derives from [Proto-Sinaitic](https://omniglot.com/writing/protosinaitc.htm) (also sometimes called “Proto-Canaanite”) letters, which evolved in the region of modern Israel and the Sinai desert between around 1900 and 1700 BC. During this period, Middle Kingdom Egypt was the dominant regional power, so the new script evolved under the influence of Egyptian culture even though it encoded a different language. For example this Sphinx from Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai:

_The Serabit el-Khadim sphinx is inscribed in both Egyptian and Proto-Sinaitic. Photo:_ _[codex99.com](http://www.codex99.com/typography/11.html)_ 

is inscribed “Beloved of Hathor of turquoise” in Egyptian and _mʿh bʿlt “beloved of [the] Lady”_ in Proto-Sinaitic.

Some scholars think the Proto-Sinaitic script was a local invention by non-Egyptian speakers who learned literacy from Egyptians; some think it was the invention on an Egyptian colonial administration to communicate with its subjects (the mines where the sphinx above were found were worked primarily by slaves, captured in campaigns in Canaan). In either case, Proto-Sinaitic characters come from the marriage of an Egyptian glyph with it’s name rendered into a Semitic word. The first sound in the Semitic word provided the sound of the letter: so a picture of a hand became _kaph_  and thus “k” and so on.

Fast forward a thousand years or so and this becomes the Phoenician alphabet which spread into Greece.

__Coptic__ 

Ironically these characters eventually full circle.

Egypt lost its independence to the Persians in 525 BC (when the Greeks were only a century or two into literacy). In 332, Alexander the Great drove out the Persians, with a good deal of support from their disaffected Egyptian subjects. Alexander’s general, [Ptolemy I Soter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter), eventually claimed Egypt for himself out of the wreckage of Alexander’s empire and established a Greek-dominated kingdom in Egypt that survived down into the Roman era, ending with the death of Cleopatra in 30 BC.

During the Greek period (and on through the Roman empire for another six hundred years) Egypt was basically bilingual. The cities were dominated by Greek speakers, and the countryside by Egyptian speakers. The government conducted its business primarily in Greek, but it retained the traditional Egyptian temple hierarchy as a kind of parallel government for its Egyptian subjects. Civil law and government were conducted in Greek, but religious matters (at least, Egyptian ones) were conducted in Egyptian. The famous Rosetta Stone is one of many parallel texts which record the same message for both Greek and Egyptian audiences during this period.

One interesting aspect of this period is the gradual creation of a creole culture combining both Greek and Egyptian elements. To some degree this was deliberate: the government promoted hybrid religious cults, like that of [Serapis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapis), intended to provide a cross-cultural unifying ideal. But the mixing was also a classic colonial byproduct: as the Greek soldiers of Ptolemy’s mercenary army settled down with local women, mixed families became common. Politically or ambitious Egyptians adopted Greek names and Greek manners, while Greeks who found Egyptian culture to their liking “went native.” Egyptian ideas, particularly the worship of [Isis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysteries_of_Isis#:~:text=Isis%20was%20one%20of%20many,conquered%20by%20the%20Roman%20Republic), became a popular cultural export.

During this period the lower ranks of the Ptolemaic bureaucracy were staffed with native Egyptians who, to do their duties, had to be literate in both Greek and Egyptian. By this period, hieroglyphs was almost entirely reserved for formal religious usage: most ordinary Egyptians used [Demotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)) for day-to-day writing. The Rosetta stone (a temple dedication) has hieroglyphs for religious solemnity but repeats the Egyptian text in Demotic for ordinary people. There are [a few examples of Egyptians using Greek characters to write Egyptian words as far back as 201 BC](https://www.quora.com/What-factual-evidence-do-novice-and-professional-linguists-give-to-show-against-evidence-from-Jean-Francois-Champollion-that-Coptic-is-derived-from-Greek/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=171696ca&srid=zLvM), but Demotic remained the primary Egyptian writing method into the early Roman era.

The script we know as “Coptic” emerges in the first century of our era. So-called “[Old Coptic](http://www.coptic-magic.phil.uni-wuerzburg.de/index.php/2019/08/30/an-introduction-to-old-coptic/)” is really a grab-bag of different efforts to extend the Greek alphabet with extra characters that represent sounds that Egyptian has and Greek does not. For example ϣ writes the sound “sh”, which Greek had no easy way to represent. For the most parts these new letters are taken almost straight from Demotic. There were [competing dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language#dialects) which tried to solve the transcription problem in different ways, but eventually two — the Sahidic dialect of Upper Egypt and the Bohairic dialect of the Delta went — became the most common. Sahidic added six Egyptian letters to the Greek alphabet and Bohairic added a seventh.

Coptic literature flourished from the second century down to the thirteenth, when it was finally eclipsed by Arabic. Although it survives today only as the liturgical language of the Coptic church, it is an invaluable reference for scholars studying the history of Egyptian language: unlike all earlier Egyptian writing systems, Coptic includes _vowels_ (thanks to Greece’s distinctive contribution) and that provides us invaluable insights into the way earlier Egyptians spoke. Plus, as the product of long exposure to other cultures Coptic also includes loan words of Greek, Latin and Hebrew origin which help us fix sound values.

So, eventually those Egyptian hieroglyphic characters cribbed by Semitic miners in the Sinai and Canaan eventually came back — about two thousand years later — to become the final written form of the Egyptian language. A similar circle defines the history of [Old Nubian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Nubian) which combined Coptic characters with three characters from the [Meroitic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meroitic_script) — itself another offspring of Demotic Egyptian.



__Postscript.__ 

The question implies that the Greek alphabet derives from Coptic, rather than the other way around. That’s easily disproved by archaeology.

The oldest recognizable Coptic writings date from the first century or so; examples of Late Egyptian written in Greek characters go back maybe two centuries earlier. There are plenty examples of Greek script dating back to the seventh or eighth century BC, a good five hundred years before any examples of Coptic are attested.

Also, it’s worth mentioning that Greek loanwords are quite common in Coptic texts. The reverse is not true: if Greek literacy really depended on Coptic it would be natural for Egyptian words (particularly for unfamiliar things like the names of letters!) to come from Egyptian into Greek. But, as we’ve seen, letter names (along with quite a few other words, like the Greek words [λέων ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BB%CE%AD%CF%89%CE%BD#Etymology)“lion” and [χρυσος ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%87%CF%81%CF%85%CF%83%CF%8C%CF%82#Ancient_Greek)“gold”) come from the Near East, not Egypt.

So: there _is_ a historic connection between Greek script and Egyptian : but it goes back much farther than Coptic, to the Middle Kingdom.
