It would drag on, with many ups and downs, for a long time — say, seven hundred years.

The Romans would generally have the upper hand — but nothing permanently decisive. They’d get walloped quite a few times.

Eventually, they’d win one final desperate fight and put a pro-Roman shah on the throne, but both sides would be exhausted shells of their peak selves.

Then the Arabs would show up and pick up the pieces.
