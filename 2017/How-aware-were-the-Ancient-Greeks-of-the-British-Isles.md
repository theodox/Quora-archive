“Vaguely” is probably the best way to describe it, at least until the Roman conquest of the islands.

It seems that a lot of early Greek information about Britain was actually second-hand information, courtesy of the Carthaginians. Before the Carthaginians lost their empire in the second century BC, they monopolized trade with the Atlantic coast of Europe. As early as around 500 BC, a Carthaginian explorer named Himilco visited Britain, but we don’t have any more details than that. By the second century BC at least, the Carthaginians had a lively trade focused on the tin and lead mines of Cornwall — so it seems likely that they were the main source of what little information filtered back. The Greek historian Herodotus (writing around 450 BC) was aware of rumored “ [tin islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiterides)” in north-western Europe but had no precise idea of where they were or even if they were real.

In terms of direct mentions in Greek sources, the oldest one is in “[On the Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Universe)” — which is sometimes ascribed to Aristotle — dated between 350 and 200 BC. It notes that there are two islands called “Brittanic,” known as Albion and Ierne (= Ireland) beyond the Pillars of Hercules (= the entrance to the Mediterranean) but doesn’t add much more than that.

The Greek explorer [Pytheas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pytheas) seems to have visited the islands personally in the 4th century BC, though we only have summaries and quotations from his book. Pytheas’ account was controversial in antiquity — many Greeks [didn’t believe his depiction of sea-ice](https://www.quora.com/Can-someone-identify-a-particular-Ancient-Greek-word-in-this-text-by-Strabo) and the midnight sun in high latitudes. There’s not a lot more original information until Roman times — some sources repeat Pytheas or critique him, but not much new info is recorded until after Julius Caesar’s invasion in 55 BC.

You can get a pretty good idea of what the Greeks knew of Britain around the time of Caesar — when of course the island was much more “in the news” than it had ever been before — in [this chapter of Diodorus Siculus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5B*.html).

There’s more in the first century from [Strabo](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/strabo/4e*.html).
