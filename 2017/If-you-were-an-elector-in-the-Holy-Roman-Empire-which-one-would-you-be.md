Everybody knows the safe choice — _booooring! —_ is to be __[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electorate_of_Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg)__ ____ or as the amateurs know it the ___Electorate of Hannover___ _._ ____ At least, that is, if it comes with a side gig as king of England. You never know when some French lunatic and his band of rabble will show up and start expropriating the crap out of you, it's important to have a plan B. Sure, you could go Brandenburg if you wanted some side action — but, as history shows, you really want a nice wide expanse of salt water between you and the Jacobin rabble.

Still, sometimes you have to follow your passion. From a purely personal point of view, I have to confess that my deep need to pontificate definitely suits me better for a job as a Prince-bishop, or better yet, a Prince-_arch_ bishop.

In that case, I think I’d take the __[Electorate of Trier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electorate_of_Trier)__ .

In addition to that sweet, sweet bundle of temporal and spiritual power it offers I’d have the additional satisfaction of occupying a city which was also the capitol not only of the Roman empire (293- 395) but also — bonus points! — of the [Gallic Empire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Empire) I’d have [the only tomb of an apostle in Europe](http://www.sacred-destinations.com/germany/trier-st-matthias) _and_ my very own [circus maximus](http://www.livius.org/articles/place/augusta-treverorum-trier/trier-photos/trier-circus/?) — the best of the old and the new!

I’m really more partial to reds, but not every elector can [stock his own cellars](https://themanfrommoselriver.com/2007/06/06/the-wine-map-of-trier/).

On a related note, I think that _every_ elector should reconsider their color choices. Who wants a gloomy, brooding schloss when you can indulge your feminine side with a whimsical pink-frosted-cupcake of a palace like this?

I’m a little less enthused about the outfits, I have to say:

The ermine, I could take or leave; I _definitely_ look better in mink, but I hate to rock the sartorial-archepiscopal boat too much. That said, those little tails are a bit much for my taste. And I think maybe some cucumber facials are in order, that wig really accentuates the bags under the eyes.

The only big downside to this one is — as so often! — those darn Frenchies. It’s not so much that I mind the occasional sack and pillage, that’s just a cost of doing business. But surely, if you’re a Most Catholic King in the middle of Europe’s one massive religious conflict, couldn’t you at least sack the fricking _Protestants_ , Louis? And, m. Robespierre, if you demand that I expel the emigres lest you invade, it’s only common courtesy _not to invade when I expel the emigres._ 



For the record, my very first act as Prince-archbishop will be to get rid of these offensive, plebeian couches and coffee tables.

This is an electoral palace, people, not a goddamn Sofitel. Maybe I’ll install them in Versailles, just to show those jerks how it feels.
