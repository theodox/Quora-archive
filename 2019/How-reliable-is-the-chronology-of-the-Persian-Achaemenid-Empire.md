It’s not bad, by the standards of the time.

There’s a strong synchronism in the [Battle of the Eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Eclipse), which we know was fought between the Medes and the Lydian empire of Croesus on May 28, 585 BCE. The date is based on the written account of the battle being interrupted by a solar eclipse, which we can date independently of any historical source. The eclipse evidently convinced both sides that it was a good time to conclude a peace; this means we have pretty solid evidence for [Astyages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astyages) on the throne of Media in 585, and thus the Persian empire is yet to come into being. The traditional date for Cyrus’ overthrow of Astyages is 550, which is consistent with (though not proof of) Herodotus’ claim that Cyrus was Astyages’ grandson.

The end of the Persian empire is of course pretty well documented in the sources relating to Alexander the Great. Alexander’s adventures can be cross referenced to events in Greece that are pretty well dated. We also have another strong synchronism in the [Babylonian astronomical diary which mentions Alexander’s victory at Gaugamela in 331 BCE](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/oriental-varia/a-contemporary-account-of-the-battle-of-gaugamela/), which coincided with a lunar eclipse.

So, we’ve got two fairly objective markers for the whole Persian era, though there’s about 30 years of ‘slop’ between the Lydian solar eclipse and the traditional date for Cyrus’s rise.



It looks like the link attached to the question is trying to reconcile the Biblical account of “Darius the Mede” in the book Daniel with conventional chronology by reshuffling the dates for the whole Persian period. That does not work well, for the astronomical reasons listed above.

A more common approach to that question is not to reshuffle the actual dates, but to focus on the names. Many ancient authors used “Mede” and “Persian” interchangeably and haphazardly; this is the default behavior among Greek and Roman authors, who seem to pick whatever sounds best most of the time. So “Darius the Mede” can easily be “Darius the Persian” — in a Greek or Roman author that would raise no eyebrows.

Secondly, we know that Persian emperors did not rule under their own personal names, but took regnal names upon becoming king. For example the The last Darius, Darius III, was actually born “Artashata” and evidently also used “Codomannos” as well.

So, we can’t be completely sure if a “Darius the Mede” is a Mede or a Persian, and if “Darius” is given name or a regnal name; a minority of scholars could see “Darius the Mede” as “Cyrus the Persian” in this murky linguistic context.

However, the easiest explanation remains that Daniel — which was written some centuries after the events it portrays — is simply confused about names and dates. It’s entirely forgivable: Babylon was conquered by the Persians three times — once by Cyrus (conventionally, 539 BCE, defeating Nabonidus) and twice by Darius (in 520 and again in 519 BCE, defeating the so-called Nebuchadnezzar III and Nebuchadnezzar IV). So it’s easy to see how an author could confuse the sequence and the order of the three conquests after the lapse of some centuries.
