Queen __Adea__ , or more formally __[Eurydice II of Macedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurydice_II_of_Macedon)__ .

Adea was a niece of Alexander the Great. Her mother [Cynane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynane) was the daughter of Alexander’s father, [Philip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Macedon) and an Illyrian princess named [Audata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audata). Although she was a royal, though, she led anything but a sheltered life in the palace. Her grandmother and mother raised her in the fierce Illyrian way, as a huntress and a fighter. She could ride and throw a javelin with the hardest of uncle Alexander’s troopers.

Alexander conquered the known world while Adea was a child But he died, unexpectedly and with no plans for his succession — [suddenly the vast empire, stretching from Greece to India, was up for grabs](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-the-descendants-of-Alexander-the-Great). (This incredibly tangled period deserves, not a movie, but a TV series on the order of Game of Thrones; compared to history, GRRM is a piker).

In the ensuing chaos there were not one, but two kings — [Alexander’s infant son ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_IV_of_Macedon)and his half-brother [Arrhidaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_III_of_Macedon), an incapacitated adult with the mind of a child. In theory, the government was a regency for both kings but loyalties were deeply divided: some Macedonians rejected Alexander’s son because his mother was a Bactrian, from modern Afghanistan; others rejected Arrhidaeus because of his disability. Powerful generals jockeyed for position — grabbing key territories for themselves and trying to create some kind of stable following out of the disaffected, often mutinous mass of Alexander’s powerful but leaderless army.

In the midst of this madness, Adea’s mother saw an opportunity. Adea had Macedonian royal blood, and at about 16, was of marriageable age. If she married Arrhidaeus, she’d be able to produce an heir with the true royal bloodline on both sides, re-uniting the fractured empire…

… and, if she could gain the confidence of the halfwit king, she could become the regent, ruling the entire empire in all but name.

[Antipater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipater), the royal governor of Macedon was already marrying off his own daughters to several of the most important generals, spinning his own web of alliances and plots. He didn’t take kindly to more competition in an already crowded field. So the two women determined on a bold stroke: they secretly recruited a small body of men from the household troops and slipped away from their genteel life at court to find Arrhidaeus and somehow convince him to marry Adea.

As soon as they were discovered missing, Antipater knew something was up. He contacted the chief regent, [Perdiccas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdiccas) — the man who ruled in the name of the kings and, not coincidentally, had just married Antipater’s daughter. Perdiccas was a hard man — he’d already connived in the murder of Alexander’s Persian wife and her unborn child — and he dispatched his brother and a band of troopers to put an end to the errant princesses.

The assassins caught up with the royal pair just outside of Sardis, where Arrhidaeus was being lodged. Pretending to be bandits, they attacked the caravan. The warlike mother and daughter snatched up their javelins and fought the “bandits” alongside their guards. Cynane fell in the fight and, Adea cried out in fury that they had murdered a member of the royal family. The ordinary troopers in the death squad did not know who their targets were supposed to be — when they heard the princess swearing in the Macedonian dialect, they recognized her and angrily refused to carry out their orders. Instead, they brought the young girl and her mother’s body to Arrhidaeus, happily falling in with the idea of a royal marriage.

Perdiccas was caught flat-footed. Before he could react, the army was demanding the marriage. Worried about a mutiny, and terrified of being implicated in the murder of a royal, he grudgingly allowed Adea and Arrhidaeus to marry, while providing a lavish the mother he had betrayed. The young girl — today, she’d still be in high school — was suddenly a queen — but the queen of a chaotic empire in the process of tearing itself apart.

Almost as soon as the marriage was concluded, Perdiccas and his army and the young kings headed south to confront Alexander’s general Ptolemy who had made himself all but independent ruler of Egypt and who had hijacked Alexander’s body and its enormous gold casket as they were slowly trundling home from Babylon to Macedonia.

Ptolemy defeated Perdicass by blockading the banks of the Nile. When Perdiccas and his army tried to cross they were repelled by the defenders and their depleted ranks were savaged by crocodiles and hippopotami. The horrified survivors were so furious at the regent that they murdered him in his tent the next night.

The leaderless army almost handed the two kings and the teenage queen to Ptolemy — but he refused the dubious honor; instead they headed off to a hastily arranged conference where a new regency would be arranged. Along the march, Adea began to rally the men — besides royalist sentiment she never stopped reminding them that their pay was long overdue. The soldiers admired her spirit as well as her royal blood

For a while she had them eating out of her hand — but the increasingly ugly mood in the army (and the prospect of a strong willed queen replacing the pliant, handicapped Arrhidaeus) alarmed all of the senior generals. To shut her down, they chose Adea’s old enemy, Antipater, as the new regent.

Antipater brought both kings and Adea back to Macedonia, where he tried to centralize power in his own hands. However he was an old man; he died in 319 — Adea was now perhaps 18 years old — and named as his successor a nonentity named [Polyperchon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyperchon). The new regent was weak, and the political game spun up around him in earnest. Soon it came to blows. Antipater’s son [Cassander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassander), a cold-blooded reptile of a man who resented being passed over in Polyperchon’s favor, raised an army from disaffected Macedonian troops and began to battle Polyperchon for control of Macedonia and Greece.

Stunned, Polyperchon fell back. In desperation he recalled Alexander’s formidable mother [Olympias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympias) from exile. She was a ferocious woman with a reputation for witchcraft and poisoning — and she was determined to protect the rights of her grandson, the boy king, so she was an implacable enemy to Adea and her hopes for a royal child of her own.

Desperate for allies, Adea struck a deal with Cassander. She bundled up the hapless Philip and escaped to join Cassander. For about a year the royal couple were at least theoretically the masters of the world. But Cassander’s armies lost ground in southern Greece and the islands, so he departed to deal with those crises leaving the royal couple almost defenseless. Polyperchon and Olympias closed in with a new army, staffed largely by Olympias half-civilized kin from western Greece.

Adea was alone, trying to lead one side in a civil war between the two halves of the royal family. But she was far from helpless. Not yet twenty, she personally recruited an army of her own and drew it up for battle in the name of her husband, the halfwit king.

When the armies met, however, Adea’s untrained troops failed her. They refused to fight against Alexander’s mother and his son, and insisted on reuniting the warring royals.

Peace, however, was not to to be. The famously vindictive Olympias confined Arrhidaeus and Adea in a bricked up stable, planning to starve them to death and thus avoid the stain of royal bloodshed. However Cassander reappeared with a new army. As his troops closed in she dispatched assassins — Thracians who didn’t care one way or another about Macedonian royalty.

Arrhidaeus was killed on the spot but the Olympias offered Adea an ironic kind of mercy : the choice of a noose, poison or a sword. Adea browbeat the assassins into letting her lay out her husband for burial. Then she laid a last curse on Olympias, who would be murdered in much the same way less than a year later. Finally, she took the noose and hanged herself without shedding a tear, defiant to the last.

_That’s_  one badass teenage girl. Step over, Maximum Ride.
