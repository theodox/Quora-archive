# Is Coptic the “modern” language that has the earliest attested ancestor, or are there other languages spoken now or recently that have very early attested ancestors?

It is, since it’s a lineal descendant of ancient Egyptian — which is tied for the title of “oldest attested language” with Sumerian. Since Sumerian has no _living_ descendants Coptic takes the title.

You could quibble a little bit, because Coptic is the final phase of what linguists call “Late Egyptian” — essentially, the language of the New Kingdom, the Ptolemaic, and then the Roman periods on through the Arab conquest. The language of the classic hieroglyphs is “Middle Egyptian,” which faded out of use in ordinary life around the end of the Bronze Age. Middle Egyptian held on through the New Kingdom and Ptolemaic eras as a literary language. Before Middle Egyptian there was an even more archaic variety too. So, you can’t assume that a Coptic speaker today sounds “just like” the language of the early dynasties.

Nonetheless, there’s an unbroken chain of linguistic development from a Coptic church service today all the way back to the first complete sentence recorded in Egyptian:

> "Seal-bearer of all golden things; Nbwi ['the Golden One', a god], he united the Two Countries for his son, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Peribsen."

The verb “unite” (written (here written 𓂧𓆓𓈖 𓆑) comes from [a root we reconstruct as /ˈtʼaːmacʼ/ ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dm%E1%B8%8Fj)(we don’t know the vowels for certain, they are guessed at). In Coptic its [ⲧⲱⲙⲧ](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%E2%B2%A7%E2%B2%B1%E2%B2%99%E2%B2%A7&action=edit&redlink=1) (tōmt). This shows the degree of drift, but also the continuity of language from the 28th century BC to today.
