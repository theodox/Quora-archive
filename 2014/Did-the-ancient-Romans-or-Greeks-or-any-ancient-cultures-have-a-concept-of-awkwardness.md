There is a lot of very detailed social commentary in the Roman satires - poets like Juvenal, Martial and Horace all devote a lot of time to dissecting nuances of social behavior. They dissect different forms of boorishness and social ineptitude at length. Usually though it's in the context of an outsider who doesn't display good Roman manners and taste - a vulgarian liuk Trimalchio in Petronius' _Satyricon,_ who is shown as tasteless, vulgar, and brash. There are similar characters in Greek comedy too, again usually nouveaux-riches outsiders who don't know the delicate code of the traditional aristocrats.

Romans believed that social awkwardness showed up in your face, literally.
_pudor_  is usually translated 'shame' or 'modesty' but also means literally 'blushing' -- your face giving away your feelings. Somebody who doesn't know how to behave (especially to their betters) is 'impudent', lacking in the sense of appropriateness. _rubor_  is similar, but it emphasizes the blush as the physical manifestation of being caught in a bad spot or caught out in guilt. Conversely _candor,_  'whiteness', implies the lack of a blush - no consciousness of guilt or being out of place.
