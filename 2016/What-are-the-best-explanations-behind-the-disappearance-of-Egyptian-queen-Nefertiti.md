I don't think there's a solid consensus. There is a modern school of thought that looks at the end of Akhenaten's reign as a period of intensive political activity. We do know his religious reforms deeply alienated the traditional Egyptian temple hierarchies, who re-asserted themselves after his death. 

Some modern readers look at that and see a lot of opportunities for intrigue -- this background is an important element for those who believe that [ King Tut may have been murdered](http://www.unmuseum.org/tutmurder.htm) in a palace coup. 

On the other hand, our records for the end of Akhenaten's reign are spotty for the same reason: the reaction against his radical policies, the abandonment of his city at [Amarna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarna) and the score-settling that followed his death mean we aren't even sure when or how she disappeared from the scene. 

Some people think that a regent named [Neferneferuaten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neferneferuaten), who ruled briefly after Akhenaten and before Tut, was actually Nefertiti ruling in her own right as a 'pharoah', much as Hatshepsut had done. This is also not a settled debate - the link includes a rundown of the many variants of the theory.

_Followers of the Nefertiti = Neferneferuaten theory note that his stele, along with the famous bust, shows her in the double crown of Egypt. Despite appearances the figure on the left is not female: Akhenaten suffered from gynecomastia._ 

TLDR: it could be a simple case of a plain old decease that happens not to be recorded in our sources; it could be a palace coup replacing a strong, independent Queen with a more pliable replacement; She could have outlived Akhenaten and ruled in her own right as Nefernefernuaten; or we may be missing something even more complicated.
