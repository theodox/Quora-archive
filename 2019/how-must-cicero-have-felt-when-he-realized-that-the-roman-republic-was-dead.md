In [the letters](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0022%3Ayear%3D48) you can see a complex mix of emotions, all bad: he constantly speaks of “disasters,” “calamities” and “ruin.”

Many of the most immediate are really about anxiety. He had to wait some months at Brundisium, to know if Caesar would really allow him back to Rome safely; through these months Cicero wrote to many of Caesar’s friends and lieutenants trying to learn if he was really going to be able to return. He worried about being killed by Caesarian supporters acting without orders. He fretted about the fate of his Republican colleagues, and had to talk some out of killing themselves. He learned that his own brother had denounced him to Caesar. He worried about how the rest of the Republicans viewed his decision to thrown himself on Caesar’s mercy. He vacillated between hoping and fearing that the Caesar might still be defeated, knowing that his old allies would be less lenient than Caesar had been.

You can get a sense of the mood from what he wrote to [Atticus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Pomponius_Atticus)in the spring of 47:

> Worn out at length by the agony of my excessive sorrows, even if I had anything that I ought to say to you, I should not find it easy to write it; but as it is, I am still less able to do so because there is nothing worth the trouble of writing, especially as there is not even a gleam of hope of things being better. Accordingly, I no longer look forward to hearing even from you, though your letters always contain something that I like to hear.

And a month later:

> The candour of your letter does not offend me, because you do not endeavour even tentatively to console me, as was your wont, under the weight of public and personal misfortunes, but acknowledge that that is now impossible.

After he received Caesar’s pardon (in late 47), immediate worries about safety receded. They are replaced by a mixture of relief and survivor’s guilt, most eloquently set out in[ this letter to Nigidius Figulus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0022%3Ayear%3D46&force=y), where he explains how he ca no longer write freely on his favorite topics — politics and the law — and how

> there only remains a certain gloomy and wretched style of letter, and one suited to the state of the times: that, too, fails me. In it there is bound to be either a promise of some assistance, or some consolation for your sorrow. I had no such promise to give: for, cast down by a similar blow of fortune, I am myself supporting my disasters by the aid of others, and it more frequently occurs to my mind to complain that I am living as I do, than to rejoice that I am alive. For although no signal injury has been inflicted upon me personally apart from others, and although it has never occurred to my mind to wish for anything in such circumstances which Caesar has not spontaneously offered me, yet nevertheless I am being so worn out with anxieties, that I regard myself as doing wrong in the mere fact of remaining alive. For I have lost not only many very intimate associates whom either death has snatched from me, or exile torn away, but also all the friends whose affection my former successful defence of the Republic, accomplished with your aid, had gained for me. I am in the very midst of their shipwrecked fortunes and the confiscation of their property; and I not only hear—which in itself would have been bad enough—but I have before my very eyes the sharpest of all pangs, the actual sight of the ruin of those men by whose aid in old times I quenched that conflagration. And in the city in which I once enjoyed such popularity, influence, and glory, I am now entirely deprived of all these. I retain, indeed, Caesar's supreme kind-ness: but that cannot make up for violence and a complete upset of the established order of things.

And there still remained the tricky task of staying out of trouble in a regime where an anonymous denunciation or a stray remark could mean death or exile, as in this to Papirius Paetus:

> I receive such attentions, such politenesses from all Caesar's favourites as may not say or do anything foolish or rash against the men in power: that too, I think, is the part of the wise man. As to the rest - what this or that man may say that I said, or the light in which he views it, or the amount of good faith with which those who continually seek me out and pay me attention may be acting - for these things I cannot be responsible. The result is that I console myself with the consciousness of my uprightness in the past and my moderation in the present… considering that Greek history is full of examples of how the wisest men endured tyrannies either at Athens or Syracuse, when, though their countries were enslaved, they themselves in a certain sense remained free - am I to believe that I cannot so maintain my position as not to hurt anyone's feelings and yet not blast my own character?

Cicero remained in semi-retirement — consoling himself, as best he could, with philosophical treatises and translations — until Caesar’s assassination, which gave him hope that the Republic might be restored. He never really stopped mourning the old Republic, though his final campaign against Antony roused him to something like his old level of energy and zeal.
