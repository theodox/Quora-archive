The worst reputations in this regard were in the rugged parts of western Greece, north of the gulf of Corinth. Thucydides singles out the [Aetolians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetolia), the [Ozolian Locrians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozolian_Locris), and the [Acarnanians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acarnania) as particularly prone to banditry in his own day:

> And even at the present day many of Hellas still follow the old fashion [of plunder], the Ozolian Locrians for instance, the Aetolians, the Acarnanians, and that region of the continent; and the custom of carrying arms is still kept up among these continentals, from the old piratical habits. The whole of Hellas used once to carry arms, their habitations being unprotected and their communication with each other unsafe; For in early times the Hellenes and the barbarians of the coast and islands, as communication by sea became more common, were tempted to turn pirates, under the conduct of their most powerful men; the motives being to serve their own cupidity and to support the needy. […] An illustration of this is furnished by the honour with which some of the inhabitants of the continent still regard a successful marauder, and by the question we find the old poets everywhere representing the people as asking of voyagers- "Are they pirates?"- as if those who are asked the question would have no idea of disclaiming the imputation, or their interrogators of reproaching them for it. The same rapine prevailed also by land.

This reputation continued right up until the Roman conquest; the [Aetolian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetolian_League), which gave the peoples of this region a more or less respectable political face starting around the time of Alexander the Great, still had a less than savory reputation in the eyes of sailors in the Ionian Sea.

The eastern Mediterranean — with constricted sea lanes and abundance of isolated rocky hideaways — has often been a good place for pirates. According to legend king Minos of Crete was the first to put together a regular fleet for the suppression of piracy (this would have been in the late Bronze Age, if it’s not just a later story) but in the _Odyssey_ Crete is singled out for its pirates. [Samos ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samos)gained notoriety under the tyrant [Polycrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycrates) — a joint Spartan/Corinthian fleet tried to curb Samian depredations but was unable to oust him from power and eventually gave up. [Lemnos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemnos) played a similar role in the northern Aegean; “[Lemnian deeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemnian_deeds)” was a byword in Greek for cruel and inhuman treatment. The Lemnians were eventually conquered by Athens, and their piratical ways suppressed by an Athenian colony planted on the island.
