__Barbarians.__ 

… in, you might say, two very different meanings of the term.

βάρβαρος, _barbaros,_ could be used in a completely neutral sense where we would often use “foreigner.” The eminently civilized Persians and Egyptians, who had many Greek admirers, were still barbarous in this sense of the term. There was some ambiguity about who was or was not counted, since somebody with at least a generation or so of speaking and acting Greek in their family background could become a Hellene for most purposes. On the other hand, ethnic consciousness clearly wasn’t completely excluded either: a fluent and eloquent writer of Greek like the Jew [Philo](http://www.iep.utm.edu/philo/) or the Assyrian [Lucian](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lucian) would always be a “barbarian” in the eyes of some Greeks.____ Josephus and Lucian both referred to their own compatriots as “barbarians” — with what level of irony we can’t really know.

In another and more pejorative sense _barbaros_  meant “people who did not live the civic life.” The Greeks made fundamental distinction between a dispersed life centered on clans and families and a communal life centered on politics and law; when Aristotle defined man as a “political animal” he meant “an animal intended to live together in organized community settings”, ie, in a [polis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polis). Polis-people were disciplined, organized, cultured; non-polis-people were supposedly incapable of higher aspirations than having enough to eat. This is the distinction that Aristotle was trying to get at in his infamous declaration that barbarians were “natural slaves” : in a society without the discipline of communal law _everyone_  is a slave, subject to the arbitrary command of the local strongman.



Obviously, all Italians were barbarians in the first sense. Although Greek writers recognized the structural similarities between Greek and Latin there were dozens of other languages which were equally close to Greek, that didn’t offer any particular distinction.*

For the second sense — which is of course more closely tied to evaluative opinion — the picture is complex .

The Greeks colonized southern Italy and Sicily extensively between the 8th and 5th centuries BC, though they never penetrated the interior of the peninsula. The colonies — collectively known as [Magna Graecia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Graecia) — were the main way the rest of the Greek world learned about Italy so their local perspective mattered a good deal.

Central and southern Italy — the regions whose coastlines were dotted with Greek cities — were dominated by tribal confederations of hard-living, hard-fighting hill people. These groups didn’t mesh well with the Greek cities that occupied the coastal plains. The __Lucanians, Bruttians, Apulians__ and__Messapians__ all lost land to the Greeks and there was constant friction along the borders. These tribes were regarded as “barbaric”in every way: violent, untrustworthy, and unrefined. The Greeks affected to believe, for example, that the [Bruttians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruttians) were descended entirely from runaway slaves and bandits.

On the other hand in the northwest, the__Etruscans, Romans, and Latins__ were very urbanized, and their civic institutions were easily recognizable to Greeks — who were, for the most part, not too close for comfort. There were well established trading links with the Greek cities of Campania; all of the alphabets of Italy ultimately derive from the [Euboean version of the Greek alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Greek_alphabets#Euboean) used in [Cumae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumae) on the bay of Naples. These peoples fit into the same general bucket as places like Phoenicia or Phrygia: non-Greek regions where organized civic life was the norm — though always, in Greek eyes, conducted on a lower plane than among Greeks.

The Etruscans had a reputation for clever metalwork and luxurious living. They also had a reputation for piracy, at least until the rise of the Syracusan navy contained their naval power in the 5th century BC. The ebb of Etruscan power contributed to the rise of Rome — but as a landlocked power Rome was less visible in the Greek world until the Romans began to butt up against the Greek cities directly in the later 4th century. The [earliest surviving mentions ](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-ancient-Hellenic-references-to-the-Roman-Republic-before-the-Punic-Wars/answer/Steve-Theodore)are from around the year 300.

The most clear, if unwilling testimony to the recognizably “civilized” character of urban Italy comes from [Pyrrhus of Epirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus), a cousin of Alexander the Great who brought a large, up-to-date Hellenistic army to Italy in 280 BC and was met by the Romans at [Battle of Heraclea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Heraclea):

> he rode up to take a view of them, and seeing their order, the appointment of the watches, their method and the general form of their encampment, he was amazed, and addressing one of his friends next to him: "This order," said he, "Megacles, of the barbarians, is not at all barbarian in character; we shall see presently what they can do…

Plutarch, [Pyrrhus](http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/pyrrhus.html), 15

Still, that impression was not strong enough to gain Italians automatic recognition as equals: 75 years later, the first Roman army on Greek soil was still denounced as a “barbarian horde” by many Greeks, at least until the Romans adopted a popular policy which freed mainland Greece from Macedonian dominion. From that point on politics, rather than culture, would tend to dominate Greek opinions about Rome and Italy. Romanophiles like [Polybius ](https://www.quora.com/What-were-popular-Greek-opinions-of-Rome-especially-before-the-Second-Punic-War-and-Rome’s-ascension-to-supwerpower-status/answer/Steve-Theodore)emphasized Roman honor, discipline, and self-denial. Romanophobes depicted Romans as greedy imperialists with only a veneer of civilization.



_* Before the rise of Rome, there was some interesting speculation on the possible non-Italian origins of different populations: for example, In Greek the Etruscans were_ _[Tyrrhenians,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrhenians)_ _who Herododotus claimed were descendants of Lydians from Asia Minor, though other writers thought were_ _[Pelasgians,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelasgians)_ _the pre-Hellenic inhabitants of Greece. Many of the peoples of southern Italy were assigned a Pelasgian origin; this probably does reflect, dimly, real connections between western Greece and south-eastern Italy in prehistoric times. The_ _[Iapygians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapygians)_ _of the southeast were correctly recognized as relatives of the Illyrians on the other side of the Adriatic._
