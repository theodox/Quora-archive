In the Republic, there was no ‘city’ government independent of the government of the empire — the city magistrates, led by the consuls, governed the city directly as well as administering the empire. In that period there was no single mayor; the two consuls shared the running of the city and the management of its foreign affairs.

Under the empire, the very old and mostly forgotten office of _[Praefectus urbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praefectus_urbi)_ __ or “urban prefect” was revived and became something very similar to a mayoralty. The praefectus urbi’s main responsibilities were managing the public grain supply, maintaining the water system, and overseeing the the city’s corps of night-watchmen, firefighters, and the [Cohortes Urbanae](https://www.ancient.eu/Cohortes_Urbanae/) — the city’s paramilitary security force (a more detailed look at the responsibilities of the prefect [here](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Praefectus_Urbi.html)) The post was, however, appointed by the emperor rather than elective; no emperor wanted to risk unrest in the city or an independent politician with troops under his command so close to home. Unlike the traditional magistrates, who were elected for annual terms, the prefects were appointed at the emperor’s pleasure and many served for very long terms.

Over time the office of urban prefects became more and more powerful. Roman law always conflated administrative and judicial functions, and over the first two or three centuries of the empire the urban prefect became the most senior judiciary official in the empire after the emperor. Cases decided by the urban prefect set precedents for the whole empire and his writ extended even to privileged people like provincial governors.

After the end of the third century, the emperors rarely resided in Rome, so the prefect was the practical ruler of the city (the office remained an imperial appointment, however, and the prefects tended to be drawn from a pretty narrow circle of dependable aristocrats). The lessened importance of Rome meant that the office of the praetorian prefect — which had originally been the leadership of the emperor’s personal security force — became a more important legal office, eclipsing the judicial powers of the urban prefects.

The office of urban prefect actually outlived the Roman empire in the west — there was a praefectus urbi at Rome under the Ostrogothic and Lombard kings of Italy down to the 8th century; the same institution in Constantinople survived (under the Greek name of the _eparchate_ down to the of the Fourth Crusade.
