There’s no evidence for Homer being written down in any writing system that predates the early form of the Greek alphabet . The earliest _known_ written version is pretty late — it was purportedly commissioned by [Peisistratos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peisistratos). tyrant of Athens, sometime after 566 BC for performance at the Panathenaia, which he instituted in that year. The alphabet was still somewhat in flux at this time.

I originally wrote:

> The modern text has the [digamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digamma) (ϝ) which mostly dropped out use in the next century or so,

But commenters correctly pointed out that the digamma doesn’t actually show up in most modern editions. I probably should have said:

> Modern scholars think the original poem made liberal use of the [digamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digamma) (ϝ) — a letter which which mostly dropped out use in the next century or so and is visible in our texts only as otherwise unusual spellings or as failure to contract words that would otherwise be elided.

The text also has the eta (which which it uses quite liberally, like Τροίη for Τροίᾱ) — which didn’t make it to Athens until the Ionian alphabet was officially adopted there in 403 BC. So our text has already been combed over by ancient hands trying to ‘regularize’ it for orthography and scansion.

Thus, it’s not clear how exactly our version reflects that first written one. All of our surviving MS ultimately derived from editions produced in Alexandria during the Hellenistic period — though a lot of intense scholarly labor went into creating those — so a lot of hands touched the text before anything which has come down to us (that may be how those eta’s got into our texts).

So - as far are surviving evidence shows, Homer always had vowels.

As far as I know the only direct attestation of a potentially vowel-less form of Greek is Herodotus’ report of “[Cadmean letters](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&getid=1&query=Hdt.%205.62.1)” at Delphi — but that may be something transitional and not real vowel-less writing. Herodotus says one of the dedications in Phoenician script is from an “Amphitryon”, which would be very hard to get from an abjad “(m)(ph)(t)(r)(n)” — I’m not sure what you’d do with the dipthong there.
