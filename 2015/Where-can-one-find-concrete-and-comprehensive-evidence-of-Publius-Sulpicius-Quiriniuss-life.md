Quirinius was a pretty major figure under Augustus, serving as a consul, a military commander and a confidante to Gaius Caesar, who at the time was Augustus' official heir. He was also well regarded by Augustus' successor Tiberius.

His entry as consul for 12 BC in the [Fasti Capitolini ](http://www.attalus.org/translate/fasti3.html#p82)a listing of of officials inscribed under Augustus. He is marked as 'resigned' - but that was pretty common under Augustus when consul was no longer a meaningful executive office but a more or less honorary job. It was not uncommon for Augustus to appoint consuls who would quickly 'resign' so another one could step into his place, padding out the roster for the year and letting more politicians in on the honor roll.

A copy of Augustus' [Res Gestae ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_Gestae_Divi_Augusti)found in [Antioch of Pisidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioch_of_Pisidia) mentions 'the year when Publius Sulpicius was consul'; that would have been done near the end of Augustus' life in 14 AD.

Two undated inscriptions (listed in the [Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscriptiones_Latinae_Selectae) as #'s 9502 and and 9503 - these must be in volume IV which does not seem to be online, however) near that city also mention Quirinius as a _duumvir_  (a generic magistracy, probably connected to the foundation of a Roman veteran colony in the same place). These are probably connected with the campaign Quirinius waged against the Homonadenses (see below); if so they must come after the consulate.

Another inscription from _ILS_  ([# 2683) ](https://archive.org/stream/inscriptioneslat01dessuoft#page/530/mode/2up)records a Roman officer, one Quintus Aemilius Secundus 'under Quirinius, the legate of Caesar,' organizing a census in [Apamea, Syria ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apamea,_Syria)and capturing fortresses from the [Itureans.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iturea#Under_Hasmoneans.2C_Herodians_and_Romans)

[Tacitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus) discusses his messy divorce in [Annals 3.21 ](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/tacitus/TacitusAnnals03.html)and his public funeral in 3.48. He include the longest description of Quirinius' public career:

> [3.48] About the same time he requested the Senate to let the death of Sulpicius Quirinus be celebrated with a public funeral. With the old patrician family of the Sulpicii this Quirinus, who was born in the town of Lanuvium, was quite unconnected. An indefatigable soldier, he had by his zealous services won the consulship under the Divine Augustus, and subsequently the honours of a triumph for having stormed some fortresses of the Homonadenses in Cilicia. He was also appointed adviser to Caius Caesar in the government of Armenia, and had likewise paid court to Tiberius, who was then at Rhodes. The emperor now made all this known to the Senate, and extolled the good offices of Quirinus to himself, while he censured Marcus Lollius, whom he charged with encouraging Caius Caesar in his perverse and quarrelsome behaviour. But people generally had no pleasure in the memory of Quirinus, because of the perils he had brought, as I have related, on Lepida, and the meanness and dangerous power of his last years.

(Gaius Caesar died in Armenia in 4AD. Tiberius' brief retirement in Rhodes began in 6BC and lasted until shortly after Gaius' death)

[The Epitome](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2H*.html#XXXII) of [Florus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florus) mentions him (3.31) fighting in North Africa against the Garamantes (in Morocco) and Marmarides (in Libya). This is not dated; it's listed in between the Roman disaster in the Teutoburger Wald in 9 AD and the death of Gaius Caesar in 4 AD so it's not clear what the dates are.

The Gospel of Luke mentions him as controlling Syria during the census that sent Joseph and Mary back to Bethlehem in 2.2:

> 2 εγενετο δε εν ταις ημεραις εκειναις εξηλθεν δογμα παρα καισαρος αυγουστου απογραφεσθαι πασαν την οικουμενην

> 2 αυτη η απογραφη πρωτη εγενετο ηγεμονευοντος της συριας κυρηνιου

The text says literally 'When _Kyrenios_  was commanding Syria' even though it is usually translated, as "When Quirinius was governor of Syria". In addition to the usual, heat/light ratio of a contested biblical citation there's no guarantee that ηγεμονευοντος, corresponds to 'holding the office of governor': ηγεμον is a generic term for 'leading' that _can_  but doesn't have to mean holding a particular office; the Latin Vulgate has _praeside Syriae Cyrino, 'When Cyrinus [sic] was presiding over Syria'_  which is equally vague.

The Jewish-Roman historian [Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus) refers to him in collecting taxes in Judea in book 18 of the [Antiquities of the Jews ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-18.html)(This translation uses 'Cyrenius' but the Greek original would be the same Kyrenios as above)

> 1. Now Cyrenius, a Roman senator, and one who had gone through other magistracies, and had passed through them till he had been consul, and one who, on other accounts, was of great dignity, came at this time into Syria, with a few others, being sent by Cæsar to he a judge of that nation, and to take an account of their substance: Coponius also, a man of the equestrian order, was sent together with him, to have the supreme power over the Jews. Moreover, Cyrenius came himself into Judea, which was now added to the province of Syria, to take an account of their substance, and to dispose of Archelaus’s money; but the Jews, although at the beginning they took the report of a taxation heinously, yet did they leave off any farther opposition to it, by the persuasion of Joazar, who was the son of Boethus, and high priest; so, they being over-persuaded by Joazar’s words, gave an account of their estates, without any dispute about it.

And

> 1. When Cyrenius had now disposed of Archelaus’s money, and when the taxings were come to a conclusion, which were made in the thirty-seventh year of Cæsar’s victory over Antony at Actium,

Which translates to 6 AD (Actium was fought in 31 BC).

St. Jerome's [Chronological Tables ](http://www.attalus.org/translate/jerome2.html#2010)presumably using Luke's gospel, list the date he was sent to Judaea as the 194th Olympiad.

The dubious Byzantine chronicler [Johannes Malalas ](http://www.attalus.org/translate/malalas.html#222)seems to have him leading an army for the Augustus in Asia Minor under the misnomer 'Curio'.

The main contention about Quirinius concerns the conflict between Josephus - who puts Cyrenius/Quirinius in charge of Syria in 6 AD, whereas Luke says the that Caesar's decree sent Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem in 2 BC. This had been argued for the last 150 years. The main camps over that time have been that

Luke got the dates wrong

Josephus got the dates wrong

Quirinius was governor twice

"When Quirinius was running Syria" is not the same as his official governorship

Luke's απογραφεσθαι doesn't refer to a taxation census but something else: like the administration of a loyalty oath which Josephus mentions for the last year of Herod's reign.

All of these are possible, none are incontrovertible. In ancient history these kinds of conflicting opinions are the norm, but when it intersects with religion people have a harder time accepting the ambiguities.
