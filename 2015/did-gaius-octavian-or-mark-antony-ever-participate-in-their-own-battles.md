Octavian was 'present' at his battles, but not usually in the front lines. He seems to have suffered from ill health that made him an uninspiring battlefield leader: 

This was the source of persistent rumors about his lack of physical courage. At [Philippi](http://www.livius.org/place/philippi/) he was certainly not in his tent when Brutus army took his camp -- one source depicts him huddling in a swamp. At [Actium](http://www.livius.org/battle/actium-31-bce/), he was reportedly sidelined with terrible seasickness, 'commanding' from a cot in the hold of one of his ships (the actual direction of the battle -- luckily for him -- fell on Agrippa).


 Of course, after he became emperor there was a lot of propaganda making him out to be a bold and forthright commander: Virgil's depiction of Actium has him standing tall on the deck surrounded by flaming missiles. So, there wss some room for debate in antiquity. Nobody except the flatterers, howerver, put him on the same plane as Caesar for battlefield heroics.
