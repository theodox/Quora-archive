It's highly unlikely for at least three big reasons.

__The unknown.__ 

The willingness to sail off into the limitless blue with no idea what lay beyond is a historical rarity -- before the 15th century only the Polynesians, and perhaps the Vikings, would willingly sail away from land into unknown waters. In a world without magnetic compasses or mechanical clocks it's extremely difficult to figure out where you actually are out of sight of land. Unless you have developed the art of stellar navigation and have extremely good rubrics for deducing landfalls from weather patterns it's almost suicidal. It's worth noting in that context that the Polynesians their [learned their skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesian_navigation) in the South Pacific where islands are comparatively common -- and that they often undertook long voyages as an alternative to starving at home on overpopulated islands.

 _Polynesia means 'many islands': it's how the Polynesians gained the confidence to try longer and longer voyages into the unknown._ 

The Carthaginians, at least, learned their trade in the Mediterranean, where coastwise sailing was the norm. They did learn how to cross blue water by dead reckoning but in the Mediterranean a mistake is only really dangerous to your schedule: you're unlikely to starve or run out of water before you hit someplace. Their longest documented voyage -- [Hanno the Navigator's ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanno_the_Navigator) southward exploration of the African coast -- always followed the land.

  For what it's worth [Juba II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II) of Mauretania (a part-Punic Roman client king in the 1st century) did leave an account of the Canary Islands (quoted by [ Pliny the Elder) ](http://www.ing.iac.es/PR/lapalma/pliny.html)that's evidently the only surviving mention of them, which suggests they weren't visited often. Evidently nobody found the Cape Verdes before the Europeans showed up in the 1450s.

__Supplies__ 

Partly because of the distances they covered and the availability of ports, Mediterranean galley's didn't carry a lot of supplies. And they tended to carry more people. A good sized galley could run to about the size of Columbus' _Santa Maria_ , or about 140 tons displacement -- but the galley would have a crew of more than a hundred (including all those rowers) where Columbus' ship crew was only about 40. This meant that long distance voyages out of sight of land would be extremely scary: food shortages are bad enough but running out of fresh water would be worse. 

Herodotus preserves an account (which he himself doubts) of a Phoenician crew sailing around Africa makes a point of mentioning that they had to stop and plant crops and wait for them to grow in order to make the trip: 

> Libya is washed on all sides by the sea except where it joins Asia, as was first demonstrated, so far as our knowledge goes, by the Egyptian king Necho, who, after calling off the construction of the canal between the Nile and the Arabian gulf, sent out a fleet manned by a Phoenician crew with orders to sail west about and return to Egypt and the Mediterranean by way of the Straits of Gibraltar. The Phoenicians sailed from the Arabian gulf into the southern ocean, and every autumn put in at some convenient spot on the Libyan coast, sowed a patch of ground, and waited for next year's harvest. Then, having got in their grain, they put to sea again, and after two full years rounded the Pillars of Heracles in the course of the third, and returned to Egypt. These men made a statement which I do not myself believe, though others may, to the effect that as they sailed on a westerly course round the southern end of Libya, they had the sun on their right - to northward of them. This is how Libya was first discovered by sea

For "Libya" substitute "the continent of Africa" -- but you get the picture.

__Routes__ 

Probably the most important reason old-world sailors had a hard time crossing the Atlantic is the combination of winds and currents. The winds and currents in the Atlantic make it fairly easy to head west from, say, Morocco and hit the Caribbean. However that also makes the return trip much harder.

Even as late as the 18th century the bulk trade across the Atlantic followed the infamous 'triangle trade': Sugar from the New World following the gulf stream to northern Europe, manufactures from Europe to Africa, and slaves from Africa to the Americas. It's hardly impossible that a Carthaginian ship woulds make it across the Atlantic thanks to a storm -- but without compasses, familiar landmarks, and a method of estimating longitude the odds of them making it back to familiar waters are almost nil. The Carthaginians did make the British Isles now and then but that was regarded as a risky adventure.
