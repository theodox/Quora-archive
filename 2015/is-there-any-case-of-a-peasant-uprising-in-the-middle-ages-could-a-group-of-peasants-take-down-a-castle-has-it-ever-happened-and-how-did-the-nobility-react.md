# Is there any case of a peasant uprising in the Middle Ages? Could a group of peasants take down a castle? Has it ever happened, and how did the nobility react?

There's also the [Jacquerie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquerie) in France, which was particularly violent, and the the [revolt of the Ciompi ](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/118187/Revolt-of-the-Ciompi)in Florence (which is sometimes regarded as the first example of a proletarian revolution in Europe).

It's worth noting that the two peak periods of peasant rebellion were the 14th and 16h centuries. 

In the 14th century, the Black Death upended the traditional relations between rich and poor: the huge mortality of the plague made labor much more valuable, and gave the peasantry bargaining power it had not had before (particularly during the long population peak which started in the early 13th century). In western Europe, the lower classes gained power at the expense of of the landlords and aristocrats; in eastern Europe, though, the aristocrats generally managed to retain their positions at the expense of the the peasantry, which is often cited as a key difference between the future development of the two regions.

In the 16th century, the revolts were frequently ideological in nature: the Reformation posed a stark challenge to the traditional order of society and many "religious" movements of the period also reflect revolutionary efforts to change the social and economic structure of society (sometimes from below, with the rise of millenial movements like the [Anabaptists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnster_Rebellion), and sometimes from above as many kings seized the opportunity to take power away from the Church). As always, knowing what's the "real" motivations were is very tricky -- but on the material plane, at least, this perios the transition from armies built around knights and their retainers to armies built around firearms and pikes also shifted the balance of power between the aristocracy and the peasantry in this period.
