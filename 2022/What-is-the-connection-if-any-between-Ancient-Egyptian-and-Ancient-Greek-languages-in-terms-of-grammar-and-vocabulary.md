There’s precious little.

If you just want a total, a [recent study suggests](https://www.academia.edu/18460110/2004_The_context_of_loanwords_in_Egyptian_Greek_in_P._B%C3%A1denas_S._Torallas_Tovar_E._Luj%C3%A1n_M.A._Gallego_Lenguas_en_Contacto_el_testimonio_escrito_Madrid_2004_57_67) there are fewer than 150 words of Egyptian origin in Greek. For the most part these describe Egyptian realities, as you’d expect: for example Herodotus says that southern Egyptians called crocodiles χάμψαi, _khamsai._ This is his effort to render the Egyptian ___ms___ __sȝ__ _mes-suh_ , “born from the egg”, a word which survives in Egyptian Arabic as _timsah_ , التِّمْسَاح. Other Egyptian words included things like the αὔσις, which is our “oasis”, and βᾶρις_,_ an Egyptian sailing vessel known in Egyptian as a _byr;_ this is probably the origin of English “barque” and “embarkation,” by way of Latin _barca._ 

What’s notable about these is that most of them are very specific to the Egyptian context. If you were not in Egypt you’d have no trouble living a life without any Eyptian-originated vocabulary. It’s pretty much exactly what you’d expect in ancient conditions of limited communication and relatively slow movement of peoples: proper names, exotica and fancy trade goods dominate the selection of choices, the same reasons why English gets words like _balkan, coffee, ottoman,_ and _sofa_ from Turkish.

That’s the simple answer.



However, the question of Egyptian etymologies in Greek has a more dubious component.

The late [Martin Bernal](https://www.quora.com/What-if-any-is-the-part-of-truth-to-Martin-Bernals-Black-Athena/answer/Steve-Theodore) tried very, very hard in [Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization](https://amzn.to/3Tn6JDh) to prove that Greece was essentially an Egyptian colony laden with important Egyptian cultural borrowings. A key part of his thesis was his contention that Greek is full of words and ideas borrowed (or “stolen”) from Egyptian.

Bernal’s [third volume](https://amzn.to/3TsfLib) is the one which attempts to demonstrate that the Greek language is full of linguistic borrowings as well — it’s very dense and doesn’t get a fraction of the attention as the headline-grabbing claims in his first book. Part of the reason for that is that hardly anyone who specializes in any of the languages Bernal discusses buys his claims. Bernal’s professional career was spent studying Chinese — not Greek, Egyptian, Akkadian, Canaanite or linguistics. His evidence is cherrypicked across numerous languages and often seems to consist of nothing more than finding a few similar consonants between a known Greek word and an Egyptian one of an arguably similar meaning.

For example the Greek word for army is __[στρατός](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%83%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%82)__ __,__ _stratos._ Bernal tries to derive this from an Egyptian root __[sḏr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/s%E1%B8%8Fr)__ __*__ which means “to lay down” or “to lie in bed.” In late Egyptian there’s a word __sḏryt__  which Bernal chooses to translate as a “bivoauc”, that is, a camp for an army on the move, giving him a plausible sounding connection to _stratos_ .

Unfortunately there are several problems here:

The “military” meaning of __sḏryt__  is very much an implication, not a solid identification; in the overwhelming majority of cases it just means “rest stop” or “place to sleep.” There’s a different Egyptian word __sḏy__ which does mean “fighter” — but you can’t play the consonant game only when it’s convenient. Where’s the “r”?

Latin has _stratus,_ Sanskrit has _stṛtá,_ Irish and Scottish have _srath,_ and Welsh has _ystrad,_ and Greek itself has _στρωτός._ This root connects to ideas of scattering (Sanskrit, Latin, and “strew” in English) to ideas of breadth or flatness (Latin, _στρωτός.,_  and the Celtic examples). Given that Greek warfare was famous for being limited to the scarce flat lands of Greece — a place where seeds are strewn — a derivation from “field” seems a lot easier than one from “sleeping place.”

We don’t know what the vowels in __sḏryt__  would be; Egyptian does not record them explicitly. What if __sḏryt__  was actually something like ‘sidiriyot’ — would that really be a stronger contender than _στρωτός (“strōtos”) ?_ 

There’s precisely no archaeological evidence for Egyptian military camps in Greece — in contrast with, say, Canaan, where the physical evidence of [Egyptian military infrastructure is blatantly obvious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beit_She%27an#Egyptian_period). Egyptian trade goods, yes: but

As you can see there definitely is room, for some interpretation: the traditional derivation of στρατός from the Indo-European root word for ‘strew’ or ‘level’ is ultimately an informed guess. Bernal’s competing guess, however, is more of a stretch: his word has to cross both a linguistic and a cultural boundary and also to change meaning quite radically.

Ancient history is all about balancing probabilities, because the nature of the evidence demands a certain amount of caution. But Bernal’s brand throws caution overboard: huge assertions resting on very tendentious evidence are his stock in trade as a philologist. Linguists are warned about the “_Sirene des_  _Gleichklangs”_ , the seductive appeal of chance similarities. Unlike Ulysses Bernal refused to be tied to the mast: when he heard the sirens singing he jumped overboard and swam like mad. That’s why he suggests that maybe the Greek word ἄτομος, “atomos” — the word used by the Greek philosopher Democritus to describe the ultimate building blocks of the universe — might be “really” derived from the name of the Egyptian god [Atum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atum) rather than the perfectly obvious combination of ἀ- “not” and -τομος, “cut”. In ancient Greek ἄτομος can be an un-cut lawn or a field that has not yet been harvested — there’s no need to invoke an Egyptian deity (and, in case you’re wondering, there are a [plenty of related Indo-European sources](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/temh%E2%82%81-)) .

The kindest way to sum up the value of Bernal’s scholarship comes from a fond, if clear-eyed, [obituary article by Alex Joffe](https://www.asor.org/blog/2013/08/08/remembering-martin-bernal/), a one-time student of Bernal’s who discovered (much to his own surprise) that one of his undergraduate papers had been used as a footnote:

> He knew enough to challenge accepted paradigms, but he rarely drilled down into the local debates and quandaries, the date of an artifact, alternative explanations for the shape of a letter. And the racist nature of 19th century Classics, so ably discussed later by Suzanne Marchand and others, was a kind of trump card Martin played often.

> But, his indignation did not equip him with a fuller understanding of archaeology or linguistics. He had little understanding and less time for the intricacies of stratigraphy, chronology or typology, or the exceptions to linguistic rules. His dogmatism was a source of strength but also a source of blindness to the weaknesses in his own arguments. The possible became the likely, the suggestive became the probable, and the heterodox nature of the argument itself became confirmation of the truth while opposition was simply reactionary. Why else would he cite an undergraduate paper except if it seemed to support his views?



For the record, if you just want a single answer about the grammar part:

No, there’s no evidence for Egyptian grammatical influence on Greek. Greek __grammar__ is fundamentally Indo-European in character; the whole notion of an “Indo-European” language family rests on the strong grammatical similarities between Greek, Sanskrit, Latin, German, Persian and Slavic languages — similarities which Egyptian does not share.

The Greek [case system](https://daedalus.umkc.edu/FirstGreekBook/JWW_FGB3.html#:~:text=There%20are%20five%20CASES%20in,grammatical%20function%20of%20each%20word.) will be quite familiar to anyone who knows Latin, German, Sanskrit or Farsi. In Greek the grammatical role of a noun is indicated by its ending, rather than by position. This system is shared with most old Indo-European languages. Egyptian., on the other hand, expresses grammatical role by a mix of position and helper words. English has a vestigial case system (that’s why we use different words for _he, his_ and _him)_ but in this sense its’ closer to Egyptian than Greek is.

Greek verbs have an [elaborate system for indicating the nature of an action](https://pressbooks.pub/ancientgreek/chapter/4/). A single Greek verb may have dozens of forms to cover all of these possibilities — actions in the past, present or future, completed or ongoing actions, activity and passivity and so on. Egyptian verbs are quite complex as well — but they don’t map directly onto the Greek categories or ones that are found in modern European languages. For example an Egyptian offers a verb prefix that turns a verb of statement into a verb of causation, for example converting _mn_ , “remain”, into _smn_ , “establish” or “cause-to-remain.” Another distinctive feature is the [stative](http://egypt-grammar.rutgers.edu/Grammar%20Points/Stative.pdf), which similar to a participle for indicating the end-state of some process : this resolves the ambiguity in English between something like “I returned from the store” and “there’s a returned letter on your desk”). One the most obvious differences between Egyptian and Greek is that Egyptian verbs are grammatically gendered in the third person; thus “he heard” is _sḏm.n.f_ but “she heard” is _sḏm.n.s._ 

There actually are some demonstrable connections between Egyptian and Semitic grammar, particularly in verb forms. Nevertheless Egyptian is a fairly unique language, and its relationships with neighboring language groups (Semitic, Chadic, and Berber) are debatable enough to keep scholars busy for a long time to come. There’s no known language which is as close to Egyptian grammatically as, say, Greek is to Latin.



* Egyptian does not record vowels. so __sḏr__ is conventionally pronounced _“sedjer”_ but Egyptologists treat the vowels as placeholders unless they can find solid evidence for them.
