Well, [Herodotus](https://www.ancient.eu/herodotus/) — widely known as the “father of History” — was also known in antiquity as the “father of lies.” [Here’s a “top 10” list of classic Herodotus mistakes.](https://listverse.com/2015/04/08/10-historical-facts-that-herodotus-got-hilariously-wrong/)*

Critics ancient and modern love to mock Herodotus for his tall tales and morality plays, his willingness to retail local myths, and his generally accepting attitude towards what he was told. When “history” begins with stories like giant ants that dig for gold, or a Assyrian queen leaving a practical joke in her tomb, or a Persian emperor putting up an inscription crediting his crown to his horse…. well, it’s fair to say that historical misinformation was present at the creation: __there’s never been a time when the mirror of history didn’t have its funhouse distortions__ .

On the other hand it’s to be a bit idea of capital-H history in the first place. One of the things Herodotus did a lot of was to compare conflicting accounts and try to make sense of them. Even though sometimes he gets it wrong, he’s doing the right thing by recognizing that it’s not time which creates the distortions in the historical picture: it’s _people._ 

The study of history is full of honest mistakes, like somebody misreading a manuscript or confusing two obscure, similarly-named kings a century apart. In general, those get sorted out over time. But, it’s also full of dishonest mistakes made by people trying make somebody look better or worse than they might deserve. That case is far more common than the former, and far harder to avoid. Just imagine yourself on a bus with a bunch of strangers trying to reach agreement about the “real” story of Donald Trump, or Brexit, or ISIS or hundreds of other topics — how much agreement can you reasonably expect? From Herodotus’ gold-digging ants to Moon landing hoaxers, history is and always has been as full of “alternative facts” as any internet chat room.



* This is not counting two thousand years or so of royal propaganda on temple walls and clay tablets: I doubt that Rameses II [single-handedly stopped the Hittite army at Kadesh](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/kadeshaccounts.htm) in 1274 BC or that [Urukagina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urukagina) really eliminated every trace of corruption from Lagash in the 25th century BC. But that stuff is propaganda aimed at contemporaries, not “history” in the strict sense.
