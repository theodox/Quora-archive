# When the Romans deified someone, what was the theological thinking? Did they think they could make someone a god?

At least officially, the idea what that they were _recognizing_  somebody who had been accepted into the company of the gods already. Often the deification was accompanied by official records of omens or prodigies which signaled the celestial event; the most famous of these is [Caesar's comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_Comet), whose appearance was taken as the sign of Caesar’s ascension. When Augustus was cremated, a former praetor “took oath that he had seen the form of the Emperor, after he had been reduced to ashes, on its way to heaven” according to [Suetonius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html).

An important aspect to remember is that posthumous deification was not a huge stretch for the Roman imagination. Roman traditional religion involved a large element of ancestor-worship, and many of the major observances of the Roman year involved offerings to the _[di parentes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parentalia)_ _,_ “the ancestral gods.” As Ovid put it in the [Fasti](https://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidFasti2.html), his poem on Roman holidays:

> Honour is paid, also, to the grave. Appease the souls of your fathers and bring small gifts to the tombs erected to them. Ghosts ask but little: they value piety more than a costly gift: no greedy gods are they who in the world below do haunt the banks of Styx.

It’s certainly true that a deified Caesar was more important than the _manes_  of uncle Lucius and Grandpa Marcus — but the difference was one of magnitude, not necessarily one of kind.

So, the role of the state was not to confer immortality: it was to authorize the public act of worship. Even people who believed that a given individual truly was divine didn’t believe that the Senate had the power to deify someone by fiat.

The official imprimatur was critical because the Roman state was always _intensely_ nervous about private religious observances of any kind: offerings to your own ancestors were an immemorial tradition but getting together to pay public honors to any deity required the sanction of the state. This was a fundamental aspect of Rome’s approach to religion: in his book [Regarding Laws](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/cicero-treatise-on-the-laws),__ Cicero laid it out quite clearly:

> Let no one have private gods—neither new gods nor strange gods, unless publicly acknowledged, are to be worshiped privately—let the temples which the fathers have constructed in the cities, be upheld—let the sacred chapels and consecrated groves in country places be protected—let the rites of the fathers be observed in the families—let the gods who have always been accounted celestial be worshipped, and those gods likewise who have merited celestial honours by their illustrious actions, as Hercules, Bacchus, Æsculapius, Castor, Pollux and Quirinus.

This quote also illustrates the segue between ancestor worship (the “rites of the fathers”) and the formal cult of the emperors: notice that the names in his last sentence are all traditional examples of mortals who were accepted into the company of the gods for their outstanding achievements. When Caesar or Augustus were added to that list, most Romans would say, “of course: they earned it.”

There is of course another side to the question: how seriously was the whole thing taken?

For many Romans the issue was more likely to be the gap between a conventionally divine figure like Hercules and the living (or at least, _recently_ living) emperor whose faults and foibles were known to many first hand. Many Romans, particularly those in the political classes who new the _divi_  personally, were less than awestruck: Vespasian’s famous last words were the less-than-orthodox “dear me… I think I’m becoming a god,” and Seneca wrote the _[Apoloncyntosis of the Deified Claudius](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10001/10001-h/10001-h.htm)_ , a bitter satire depicting Claudius’s embarrassing fate when he arrives in heaven. One person might smirk at a former emperor’s deification on skeptical grounds, and another simply might feel that that the late emperor didn’t merit mention alongside the great names of the past. Almost noone, however, expected that the Senate could simply confer immortality the way it handed out tax-exemptions.
