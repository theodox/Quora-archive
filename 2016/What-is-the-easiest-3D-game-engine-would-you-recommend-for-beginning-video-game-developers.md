If you explicitly want to avoid Unity: 

Unreal is great for artists and designers -- if your project does not involve complex code, Unreal is very pretty and has a good graphical scripting environment. It won't scale to large projects without using C++ code, which is probably not a good choice for beginners because it's a much more tweaky, punishing language than Unity's C#

[Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/) from Carnegie Mellon uses Python, so the coding side is less intimidating. The graphics performance however isn't going to match Unity or Unreal. If the project is intended for beginning coders it may be a good choice.

 [Torque Engine](http://www.garagegames.com/) is a little long in the tooth but it's capable enough for beginner projects. It's programmed in a C-like scripting language, so might be a good choice in a context were C-style languages were being taught.

[BabylonJS ](http://doc.babylonjs.com/)is much less mature than competitors but, being JavaScript based, it's a essentially zero-setup installation. On the other hand, JavaScript programming is... special.. Good for people with web backgrounds.
