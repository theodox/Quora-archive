# Are there any detailed accounts about the fate of Hannibal Barca after the loss at Zama and about the inhabitants of the Carthaginian cities other than Carthage itself after its ultimate fall to Rome?

__After Zama__ 

The fate of the other Carthaginian cities is fairly simple. After Zama and the Carthaginian surrender, the Carthaginian empire was dismantled.

Carthaginian territories in Spain became part of the Roman empire. It’s not clear what will have become of their Punic populations. The largest city, [Qart Hadasht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cartagena_(209_BC)) or Carthago Nova, was sacked and depopulated, but other centers seem to have survived. The most strategic ones (Qart Hadasht, Tarraco, Gades) became Roman garrison towns; smaller ones probably fell under the control of local Iberians allied to Rome.

In North Africa, many of the Punic cities became subject to the Numidian kingdom of Scipio’s ally [Massinissa](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/massinissa/). The Numidians and Carthage would fight several times after the war. The Numidians were culturally quite close to Carthage after centuries of trade and intermarriage, but they were also ambitious and expansionist. In theory both Numidia and Carthage as Roman “allies” should have had their disputes mediated by Rome. In practice, however, the arbitrations almost always favored Numidia thanks to Roman suspicions of Carthage and Massinissa’s friendship with Scipio and other prominent Romans. One of the causes of the Third (and final) Punic was in 151 was another of these Numidian raids, which provoked Carthage into war — and into breaking the formal terms of their treaty with Rome.

Punic cities that ended up under Numidian control generally retained local government and Punic culture. The whole of North Africa would retain many distinctive Punic features until the end of the Roman empire in the west, although after the [Jugurthine War (106 BC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugurthine_War) the Romans began planting colonies of veterans in the area, and over the following two centuries North Africa would become very thoroughly and enthusiastically Romanized.

__Hannibal’s fate.__

_This is believed to be the only contemporary portrait of Hannibal_ 

As for Hannibal — he had a rough time.

Despite his successful campaigns in Italy Hannibal had a lot of enemies back home. Hannibal’s family had been the driving force behind the anti-Roman policy that led to the war, which was enough to earn him bad blood with many; but the Barcids were also populists opposed to the aristocrats who ran Carthage. Ironically Hannibal wanted to negotiate — on his return from Italy his first act was to recruit Massinissa as a go-between for a peace feeler — but he was forced to fight by the popular party. After Zama, Hannibal again wanted to surrender and again the populists wanted to fight: Hannibal himself forcibly removed a die-hard speaker from the podium before pleading with the Carthaginian council to accept the Roman terms.

In the aftermath, Hannibal was left at liberty by the Romans. The aristocrats still distrusted him, suspecting him of aiming at a dictatorship, but the populist still supported him. Within four or five years he was elected _suffete_ (the Carthaginian version of a consul) and he organized some important populist reforms. The agricultural policies he championed would eventually bear fruit in Carthage’s surprisingly swift recovery from the war. However his position was precarious and Carthaginian politics was pretty fierce. Soon, his aristocratic opponents told the Romans that he was planning on abrogating the treaty and allying with the Seleucid emperor [Antiochus III ](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/antiochus-iii-the-great/?)against Rome.

When the Romans sent a commission to see for themselves if this was true, Hannibal fled to Tyre in Phoenicia, the original mother-city of Carthage. However, he soon found his way to the court of Antiochus. In 193, Hannibal was among the envoys to a conference between Antiochus and the Romans held at Ephesus. This resulted in [one of the most famous tete-a-tetes in ancient history](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/appian/appian-the-syrian-wars/appian-the-syrian-wars-2/) , when Scipio Africanus and Hannibal met on neutral ground:

> It is said that at one of their meetings in the gymnasium Scipio and Hannibal had a conversation on the subject of generalship, in the presence of a number of bystanders, and that Scipio asked Hannibal whom he considered the greatest general, to which the latter replied, "Alexander of Macedonia."

> To this Scipio assented since he also yielded the first place to Alexander. Then he asked Hannibal whom he placed next, and he replied, "Pyrrhus of Epirus," because he considered boldness the first qualification of a general; "for it would not be possible," he said, "to find two kings more enterprising than these."

> Scipio was rather nettled by this, but nevertheless he asked Hannibal to whom he would give the third place, expecting that at least the third would be assigned to him; but Hannibal replied, "To myself; for when I was a young man I conquered Spain and crossed the Alps with an army, the first after Hercules. I invaded Italy and struck terror into all of you, laid waste 400 of your towns, and often put your city in extreme peril, all this time receiving neither money nor reinforcements from Carthage."

> As Scipio saw that he was likely to prolong his self-laudation he said, laughing, "Where would you place yourself, Hannibal, if you had not been defeated by me?" Hannibal, now perceiving his jealousy, replied, "In that case I should have put myself before Alexander." Thus Hannibal continued his self-laudation, but flattered Scipio in a delicate manner by suggesting that he had conquered one who was the superior of Alexander.

Peace conference or no, Antiochus was preparing a fight with Rome and Hannibal was happy to egg him on. Antiochus was unrealistically optimistic about Greek enthusiasm for his campaign, failing to see how popular the [recent Roman defeat of Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Macedonian_War) had been in Greece. Hannibal warned him that his army was too small, and — predictably — tried to convince Antiochus to invade Italy, creating one of history’s great what-if’s but failing to convince the emperor.

[Antiochus invaded Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman%E2%80%93Seleucid_War) in 192. His campaign proceeded very poorly: his too-small expeditionary force received no local support and was badly beaten by the Romans at [Thermopylae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)) when an ancestor of the famous Cato followed the same path that the Persian immortals had used to flank the Spartans. Antiochus did not make use of Hannibal on the battlefield: oddly, he took one the greatest generals of the age and confined him to a minor naval command in the eastern Mediterranean. Hannibal, who had never commanded a battle fleet, lost to a Rhodian squadron allied with Rome at [Eurymedon ](http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_eurymedon.html)in 190. The Romans then humbled Antiochus at [Magnesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Magnesia) in one of the great phalanx-vs-legion contests, bringing the war to an end.

As part of the peace treaty the Romans demanded the surrender of Hannibal (the Seleucids, never known for chivalry, agreed). Hannibal fled, first to Crete where the Romans nearly caught up with him and thence up the Aegean to the Black Sea. He eventually found service with [Artaxias, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artaxias_I)a rebellious satrap of Antiochus, who created a new kingdom for himself in Armenia with Hannibal’s help. The Carthaginian is s[aid to have drawn up the plans for the capital city of the new state](http://hannibal-barca-carthage.blogspot.com/2011/12/hannibal-in-armenia.html).

A few years later Hannibal took up a commission from king [Prusias I of Bithynia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prusias_I_of_Bithynia) who around 186 or so was preparing a war against [Eumenes II of Pergamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumenes_II). This may have appealed to Hannibal as a chance to strike at Roman interests, since the Pergamenes were staunch Roman allies. Hannibal won several battles against Pergamon — including, famously, a sea battle in which dropped clay pots full of snakes onto the decks of enemy ships — but in 183 the Romans intervened. They forcing Prusias to make peace — and Titus Flamininus, the Roman envoy, demanded Hannibal in chains.

Hannibal was not taken alive. The exact date and manner of Hannibal’s death are unclear; the sources don’t agree. Plutarch’s version in the [Life of Flamininus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plut.%20Flam.) is the most quoted:

> Hannibal took to flight once more, and after many wanderings, finally settled down at the court of Prusias in Bithynia. No one at Rome was ignorant of this, but all ignored him on account of his weakness and old age, regarding him as a castaway of Fortune. Titus, however, who had been sent by the senate as ambassador to the court of Prusias on some other business, and saw that Hannibal was staying there, was incensed that he should be alive, and although Prusias made many fervent intercessions in behalf of a man who was a suppliant and a familiar friend, would not relent….

> [Hannibal] had always distrusted the weakness of Prusias and feared the Romans, and therefore even before this time his house had been provided with seven underground exits leading from his own chamber. These ran in different directions beneath the surface of the ground, but all had secret issues far away. Accordingly, when he now heard of the behest of Titus, he set out to make his escape by way of the underground passages, but encountered guards of the king, and therefore determined to take his own life. Some say that he wound his cloak about his neck and then ordered a servant to plant his knee in the small of his back, pull the rope towards him with all his might until it was twisted tight, and so to choke and kill him; some, too, say that he drank bull's blood in imitation of Themistocles and Midas; but Livy says that he had poison which he ordered to be mixed, and took the cup with these words: "Let us now put an end to the great anxiety of the Romans, who have thought it too long and hard a task to wait for the death of a hated old man”…

> Such are the accounts of the death of Hannibal. When the story of it was brought to the senate, many of them thought the conduct of Titus odious, officious, and cruel; for he had killed Hannibal when he was like a bird permitted to live a tame and harmless life because too old to fly and without a tail, and there had been no necessity for his doing this, but he did it to win fame, that his name might be associated with the death of Hannibal. Men also pointed to the clemency and magnanimity of Scipio Africanus and admired it all the more, since after defeating a Hannibal who had not been conquered before and was filling Africa with fear, he neither drove him from the country nor demanded his surrender by his fellow citizens, nay, he actually gave him a kindly greeting when he held conference with him before the battle, and after the battle, in making terms of peace, he did not insult or trample upon the fortunes of his foe.
