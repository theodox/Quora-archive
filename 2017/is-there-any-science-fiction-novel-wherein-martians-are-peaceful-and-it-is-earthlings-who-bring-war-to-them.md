[The Martian Chronicles](http://amzn.to/2zj9y3w) fits the bill pretty well. All of the stories in the book analogize human contact with Mars and the European colonization of the Americas. The humans bring disease, cultural dislocation, and eventually colonization in their wake.

The Martians in the stories are not pacifists, exactly, but their resistance is psychic, rather than military or political. Devastated by human diseases their primary way of fighting back is by manipulating the imaginations of the conquerors.

Whether or not it fits the question perfectly, itâ€™s a wonderful read.
