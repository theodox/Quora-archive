If you’re using it to win an art contest or to land a job, yes: you’re adding a few minutes of your own work on top of hours of somebody else’s, so you should be clear to anyone who will trying to judge your skills based on the content how much of the work is yours.

If it’s not about your modelling skills, that’s fine. If you’re building a gothic cathedral and you download a high-poly gargoyle from Turbosquid, retopologize it and use it all over your scene that’s just doing assembly work. It’s still a good idea to credit the original model, however.
