Nine queens â€” the famous one is [Cleopatra VII of Egypt . ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra)Her daughter with Marc Antony, [Cleopatra Selene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_Selene_II), survived the Roman conquest; Augustus married her off to [Juba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II), the king of Mauretania (=Morocco).

Cleopatra was a pretty common Macedonian name so there was one more unrelated queen, [Cleopatra Thea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_Thea) of the Seleucid empire.
