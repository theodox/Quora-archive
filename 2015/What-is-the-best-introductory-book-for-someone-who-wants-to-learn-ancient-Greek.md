There are several decent books. The one I've seen most is from the Joint Association of Classical Teachers and comes with two books, a reader and a grammar/lessons book:

[Reading Greek: Grammar and Exercises: Joint Association of Classical Teachers: 9780521698528: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Greek-Association-Classical-Teachers/dp/0521698529/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y)
[Amazon.com: Reading Greek: Text and Vocabulary (9780521698511): Joint Association of Classical Teachers: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Greek-Association-Classical-Teachers/dp/0521698510)

Learning the alphabet is not too tough, but you'll have to pay careful attention to the accents and aspiration marks which are very important (and which costly me a letter grade in my freshman year, so I know first hand). 

 The vocabulary is of course going to be tricky, although if you are well read in english and have a good ear you'll start to see familiar roots quickly. In the internet era, of course, memorizing will be less important than it used to be but you'll need to do some if you want to read at any speed.

Grammar will be hard if you've never done formal grammar. Greek, like Latin and German, uses word endings to convey the role that words play in the sentence -- who is the subject or the object and so on. This means that many words will appear in lots of forms and you'll need practice to recognize the endings. There are the usual 1st, 2d, and 3d person versions of verbs, and multiple tenses. There are a couple of concepts like the [middle voice ](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/middle_voice) and the [aorist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorist) tense which have no direct equivalent in English and take some getting used to.

 The [grammatical case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case) structure is also more complex than English. This means extra word forms -- though like everything else these days the [ Greek grammar tables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_grammar_%28tables%29) are available on line -- but also a little more attention to formal grammar than most people pay in contemporary English: you may find it helpful to brush up on your grasp of English grammar before getting in to Greek so you don't have to learn both new technical terms and a new language at the same time. If you've done any formal foreign language study, but particularly Latin or German, you'll have a big head start.

Once you're going, there is actually a good amount of bilingual material to work with. The [ Loeb Classical Library](https://www.loebclassics.com/) provides Greek-on-one-side, English-on-the-other versions of all the standard Greek texts, so its easy to work through a passage with a translation right there to start with. There are also a zillion versions of the New Testament available with Greek and English side by side or line-by-line along with notes, although there are some notable differences in the language over the 7 or 8 centuries between Homer and Paul.
