# The ancient Greeks are believed to have used mirrors to reflect the sun's rays onto invading ships and set them on fire. Is such a thing possible and has any modern group tried to duplicate this?

You’re thinking of the __[Archmedes Mirror.](https://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Mirrors/Tzetzes.html)__

Most moderns are [sceptical](http://www.unmuseum.org/burning_mirror.htm), including the TV show [MythBusters](https://mythresults.com/episode46). However I’m pretty sure the story is true.

Since it’s a compelling story the experiment been attempted several times. For example, a [recent attempt in 2005](http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/experiments/deathray/10_ArchimedesResult.html) definitely got a fake ship to smolder; however, the MIT students who ran that test said they felt the results were inconclusive.

However I think the test actually is a very strong argument for the truth of the story.

__Solar power__ 

For one thing, the MIT students cited sun power as a limiting factor. However the MIT kids ran their test in Cambridge MA—almost 500 miles farther from the equator than Syracuse. At the summer peak , Boston gets about[ 6.8 kWh of solar energy per square meter—](https://weatherspark.com/y/26197/Average-Weather-in-Boston-Massachusetts-United-States#Sections-SolarEnergy)[Syracuse gets 8](https://weatherspark.com/y/78340/Average-Weather-in-Siracusa-Italy#Sections-SolarEnergy), or about 12% more.

[June and July are mostly cloudless in Syracuse](https://weatherspark.com/y/78340/Average-Weather-in-Siracusa-Italy#Sections-Clouds) as well. For the very specific case of the siege of Syracuse, we can be sure that the Roman ships would only be targets during the summer campaigning season, for reasons I’ll get to in a minute.

__Range__ 

The real limitation of the mirror as a weapon is range. The MIT experiment worked at a range of 100′—shorter range than a bows or catapults, which definitely limits the general use of the weapon.

However when people dismiss the story on that account they are not paying attention to the other side of the equation. The Roman ships at Syracuse were [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambuca_(siege_engine)):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-81cf72ca2e4d227179728bf088309766-c)

That’s a reconstructed picture of a sambuca, a siege galley with large scaling ladder. (If you look closely you’ll notice it’s a catamaran made of two galleys lashed together to support the siege engine.) A sambuca’s job is to row right up to the city wall and deposit soldiers onto the battlements. This means not only will the ship be close enough for a 100′ beam to be dangerous—it will also be almost stationary, a perfect target for the focal point of many mirrors.

We know that another key weapon employed by the defenders was [Archimedes’ Claw](http://www.oddlyhistorical.com/tag/archimedes-claw/)—a giant crane which was used to overset Roman galleys attacking the walls. This gives a good idea of how close the attacking ships had to be to do their job…as well as demonstrating that short range is not enough to discount the story.

__Timing__ 

The unwieldy design of the sambucae also explains why the attacks were going to happen primarily in the summer months. From October through May the Ionian Sea is prone to serious storms, and the topheavy sambucae would be extremely vulnerable to bad weather.

In the first Punic War, the Romans lost two entire fleets to storms in Sicilian waters—mostly thanks to their disregard for the sailing seasons. In the second war they were more prudent.

__TL__ ;__DR__ 

Lots of people have tried recreating the Archimedes mirror. There’s even large [library of YouTube videos of people trying it out](https://www.google.com/search?q=archimedes+mirror&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=vid&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3npCluNLVAhVN5WMKHR1uCqMQ_AUIDCgD&biw=2327&bih=1213). They usually demonstrate that you can set things on fire at a baseball-infield distance without much trouble. Under the unique circumstances of the siege of Syracuse—where big, slow moving galleys had to creep right up to the city’s seawalls—the mirror is a totally plausible, though extremely specialized, weapon.
