There are quite a few. The boring ones, of course, are Egyptian/Greek; there around 450 examples in the [Corpus of Ptolemaic Inscriptions](http://cpi.csad.ox.ac.uk/about/) (which has a website, but unfortunately does not seem to have published the actual documents online yet.

The interesting ones are _other_ language combinations.

There are few texts which are bilingual in Egyptian (usually demotic) and [Meroitic](http://www.ancientsudan.org/writing_02_meroitic.htm), the language of the Nubian kingdom of Kush across Egypt’s southern borders. Sometimes we find Meroitic (a language[ we still know very imperfectly](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7786361.stm)) transcribed in Egyptian characters — usually Hieratic or Demotic. Sometimes we find Egyptian language inscriptions from Nubia with Meroitic proper names or individual words — early “official” Kush used Egyptian but there were clearly some concessions to local realities. Around the fourh century BC, Kushites adapted Egyptian hieroglyphs to write their own language (though their system was far simpler and more phonetic than the Egyptian variety). A couple of hundred years later they mostly switched to a cursive script adapted from Demotic Egyptian. The similarity in characters means we can often sound out meroitic but, unfortunately, have a very hard time actually understanding it.

There a few commercial documents in a mix of (usually Demotic) Egyptian and Aramaic, which date from the Persian period. The [Caylus vase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caylus_vase) has an extremely exotic quadrilingual inscription in Hieroglyphic Egyptian, Babylonian cuneiform, Elamite cuneiform and Old Persian cuneiform. It’s actually very important in [the early decryption of cuneiform](https://www.quora.com/How-did-historians-learn-Sumerian-How-was-such-an-old-dead-language-decoded/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=6f1c236c&srid=zLvM), because it established rough sound values for some of the Persian cuneiform characters and suggested that cuneiform could be used to write Persian, a language which 19th century scholars could more or less understand.

_The inscription on the Caylus vase._ 

By far the coolest example is not exactly a multilingual. The (sadly misnamed) [Eternal Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%E2%80%93Hittite_peace_treaty), which concluded the war between Egypt and the Hittite Empire in 1259 BC was important enough that both sides retained copies. The original treaty was inscribed on silver tablets in both Egyptian and Akkadian (the Hittites had a language of their own, but Akkadian was an international language of diplomacy at the time). The originals are losts but copies of the text were also preserved by both sides — the Egyptian version is carved on a wall of the [Temple of Karnak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnak) and the Hittite copy was found in the ruins of the Hittite capital at [Hattusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattusa). Since these were found hundreds of miles and about 60 years apart they did not contribute to the decryption of either Akkadian or Egyptian — but the ability to compare the same treaty in two different language is a rare and precious treat historians of both cultures.

_Apparently, you can get an iPhone case decorated with the Hittite version of the Eternal Treaty. This is probably the only good thing about the year 2020… except that it’s for older iPhone.._
