The state retained final control over all religious expression. Augury, in particular, was traditionally very tightly controlled because of concerns about social order. _Unlicensed_  soothsayers and astrologers were periodically expelled from the city, although they always turn up again pretty quickly -- the expulsions tended to happen whenever social tensions were running high and authorities worried about the popular mood. Anything that might get the general public too enthused was strictly controlled: unofficial copies of the [ Sibylline Books](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Sibyllini_Libri.html) were hunted down to prevent prophetic disorder, and when excavators found what purported to be the [ books of Numa Pompilius](http://romanhistorybooks.typepad.com/roman_history_books_and_m/2006/01/the_books_of_nu.html) -- the founder of the Roman state religion! - the praetor had them burned, unread, for fear of disturbing the people.

The official augurs, on the the other hand, were closely allied with the government. In the republic the augurs were a _collegium_  -- essentially, a religious order -- and chose their own members; however we can assume that the politics which led Caesar to be chosen _pontifex maximus_  in the college of Pontifices probably also extended to bribery and horse-trading in selections to the augural colleges. Certainly deep belief seems not to have been a requirement: Cicero, whose [ de Divinatione](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Divinatione/home.html) is a takedown of augury worthy of The Amazing Randi, nevertheless was chosen as an augur, and regarded it as the capstone of his post-consular career.

All formal Roman acts - from an election to a meeting of the Senate to the start of a battle -- had to be 'inaugurated'; that is, the presiding magistrate had to affirm that no negative omens could be seen before business could begin. Strictly speaking this was a religious duty of the magistrate, not of the augurs themselves: the augurs were supposed to be technical consultants who made sure that the magistrate followed proper procedures and helped interpret more complicated signs. The augurs could, theoretically at least, invalidate an official act if they decided retrospectively that it had be inaugurated improperly or the signs misinterpreted. For this reason Cicero described augurs as the most powerful officials of the state.

 Not surprisingly this power was abused. Livy tells the story of [faked omens](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.865?rgn=main;view=fulltext) in the Samnite wars (justly punished, of course, since this Livy). The [Lex Aelia et Fufia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Aelia_et_Fufia) of 150 BC was intended to break the exclusive hold of the college of augurs on the power of cancelling official business due to abuse. Caesar's enemy and co-consul [Bibulus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Calpurnius_Bibulus) tried to use bad omens to keep Caesar from enacting his program in 59BC, but failed in the face of mob violence and opposition from the tribunes; while Dio Cassius says Caesar himself tried to [pack the augural college](http://lexundria.com/dio/42.21/cy). By the time Augustus tried to restore the traditional forms, the belief system that sustained the practice had mostly faded, leaving only a formal set of ritual observances (and, needless to say, under the empire nobody could tell the Emperor what to do).
