Generally, you’d be able to read something simple, like the easier bits of Caesar, at the end of your first year of a college level course. Cicero and Livy will be a bit tougher: they are more literary and less direct, plus it’s often less clear how the subject matter works; for me those were later second year. Poetry can be better for some readers and worse for others; I have zero ear for scansion so I get very little out of the structure of the lines — but at least the music tends to discourage the overwhelming pileup of clauses that you get in more ambitious prose writers. Most courses doe some poetry — typically Catullus or Horace — in the second year. My impression is that Ovid usually comes later.

You may find [this article](http://latinandgreekselftaught.blogspot.com/2011/05/teaching-yourself-latin-and-greek.html) a useful measuring stick. It points out that there are bits and pieces of Caesar, Cicero, Livy and Ovid in [Wheelocks’ Latin Reader](http://amzn.to/2m1m0Nt) which is a second-or-third year text.

One nice thing to remember is the [Loeb Classical Library](https://www.loebclassics.com/) which presents all of your Roman authors in a facing-page format. The translations are often a bit stodgy but the parallel pages are an invaluable help when you start to flounder. Plus the middling quality of the translations makes you feel great when you decipher something more fluently on your own.

For medieval stuff: the Vulgate is often a fairly easy read, particularly the psalms (especially if you’re familiar with them already) — unlike Augustan rhetoric it rarely strains for grammatical effect, although the classicists tend to sniff it at its straightforward construction. Medieval Latin is a mixed bag; sometimes it’s surprisingly easy because it contains a lot of Germanicisms that come naturally to English speakers, but sometimes it is gnarly indeed due to vocabulary or to the extremely technical subject matter (eg, scholastic theology or law). Reading the manuscripts is a whole separate discipline too; the Middle Ages loved their abbreviations & shortcuts (though technically the ampersand is not Medieval, it goes back to Cicero’s secretary Tiro).
