A bit shaky, actually. There’s good reason to think that Alexander’s success owes a lot to the way Persian politics had been running for the previous 50 years or so.

There were three serious rebellions among the Persian satraps (372–362, 366–363, and 362) which underlined the weakness of the Persian satrapal system: it worked really well when the regional governors were loyal but it gave them a lot of room for independent maneuvering that was not good for the empire.

_[Datames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datames)_ _, the most potent of the rebel satraps. This coin is a quintessentially complex Achaemenid piece: Greek workmanship, an Aramaic legend, the faravahr of Ahura Mazda on this side but on the reverse, the Ba’al of Tarsus, depicted more or less as a Greek Zeus. The name here reads TRKMW, the name Datames used in the local language of Tarsus Photo:_ _[Numismatics.org](http://numismatics.org/collection/1977.158.561)_ 

One really worrisome aspect of the satrapal revolt was the fact that the rebel satraps worked with the Egyptians. The Egyptian rebel pharaoh [Amyrtaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyrtaeus) had driven out the Persians in 404 (in part, because of the chaos that followed on a different Persian rebellion: the failed coup of [Cyrus the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Younger)). Once the satraps were brought to heel, the Persians shifted their focus on retaking Egypt. Unfortunately for imperial prestige, they were humiliated by the Egyptians in 351. Both sides of the conflict relied heavily on Greek mercenaries, a sign of the shifting balance of tactical power in this period.

This failure and the appearance of weakness triggered new revolts in Phoenicia and Cyprus. These were put down at great cost: the final Persian force numbered 330,000 — but again, the striking power of the army was concentrated among Greek professionals. The ancient city of Sidon was annihilated, which might have been satisfying but also put a serious dent in imperial revenues.

_Two coins illustrating the shaky nature of Persia’s hold on the west. Above, a coin of Sidon in Phoenicia with the Persian “archer” motif opposite a Sidonian galley (coin of_ _[Abdashtart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdashtart_I)_ _, 365–352 BC). Below, a coin from the same city and the same king at the same time, but minted with Greek tastes in mind: Abdashtart (known in Greek as Straton) collaborated with the Greek and Egyptian backers of the Satraps’ revolt. He was eventually allowed to keep his throne — however Sidon revolted again under his successor_ _[Tabnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennes)_ _and was destroyed by Artaxerxes III.

In 343, Artaxerxes finally retook Egypt (again, both armies had Greek mercenaries at their cores). The second Persian occupation was, if anything, worse than the first in its approach to Egyptian sensibilities — when Alexander appeared, less than a decade, it was easy for him to pose as a liberator.

At that point, things looked alright for Persia: Egypt and the Levant retaken, the satraps more or less in hand, and the treasury replenished with the loot of the western campaigns. But things took another turn with court intrigue: this sinister eunuch vizier [Bagoas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagoas) — a figure right out an Orientalist melodrama — had Artaxerxes III murdered (at least, that was the ancient gossip, widely believed). The replacement king, [Artaxerxes IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arses_of_Persia), was essentially a puppet of of Bagoas. When he tried to free himself from the vizier’s influence, Bagoas had him killed (in 336).

[Darius III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_III), the emperor who finally faced Alexander, was from a cadet branch of the Achaemenid house. He was a war hero (assuming, of course, that his exploits weren’t embroidered by the Persian equivalent of a friendly press) but not distinguished for political savvy or organizational aptitude. He was, however, smart enough to rid himself of Bagoas in short order — it’s said, after discovering that the power hungry eunuch was plotting to have him replaced on the throne like his cousin and uncle before him. Darius took the throne in 336, the same year as the far more capable Philip II became “captain of the Greeks” in preparation for his anti-Persian campaign. While Alexander was securing his throne in Macedon after Philip’s assassination, Darius was getting rid of Bagoas (technically, the last war of the Persian empire had already begun — Philip’s forces were already on Persian territory, north of the Maeander, in 336).

So — when Alexander had finally secured his own throne, put down his restive Greek “allies” and destroyed Thebes he face a Persian emperor who had only been his own man for two years. The empire had been shaken by court intrigue, it’s western extremities were recently pacified and disaffected, and it was heavily dependent on foreign military expertise. Alexander’s achievements looked miraculous to his contemporaries, but with the benefit of hindsight it’s clear he was also dealing with a Persian foe that was far from its historic peak.
