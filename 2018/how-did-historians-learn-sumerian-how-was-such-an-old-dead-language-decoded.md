Sumerian really is kind of a miracle baby among deciphered languages.

Ordinarily it’s almost impossible to decode a language with no living descendants — the range of possibilities in the relationship between written symbols and a spoken language is immense. That’s why most of the work on things like the [Vinca symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_symbols) or [Elamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language) remains guesswork, and why the understanding of hieroglyphics foundered until people found a phonetic connection between a handful of symbols and known proper names. Without some kind of key that connects the graphic and spoken versions, there is nothing to work with.

__The necessary background: cuneiform__ 

Sumerian would still be a complete mystery today, except for two happy accidents of preservation.

The first puzzle-piece is the decryption of the cuneiform writing system by [Sir Henry Rawlinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Henry_Rawlinson,_1st_Baronet) in the middle of the 19th century. Rawlinson was a British soldier-diplomat in Mesopotamia. During his time in Mesopotamia, Rawlinson became interested in the [Behistun Inscription](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Persia/Behistun.html), a very late cuneiform text inscribed by the Persian emperor Darius I around the beginning of the 5th century BC, more than a millennium and a half after Sumerian had declined into obscurity.

Rawlinson wasn’t just a soldier and a diplomat — he was also a climber. He scaled the nearly inaccessible rock cliff where the text was inscribed, producing a careful transcription of the cuneiform text. He then drew on the work of a few European scholars (particularly [Georg Friedrich Grotefend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Friedrich_Grotefend)) who had already identified a small handful of cuneiform signs and conventions, which helped him spot Persian proper names in the portion of the inscription which was written in Old Persian. That, in turn, began the unravelling of cuneiform by pinning some of the signs to phonetic values.

__Persian to Akkadian__ 

Behistun turned out to be an extraordinarily lucky find, because the cuneiform version of Persian is a neat, artificial script — it exists in only a handful of official inscriptions, and it never became widespread. Persian cuneiform is almost entirely syllabic, and thus much easier to read, than the older cuneiform systems. So, it only took a few years for Rawlinson to produce a fairly complete reading of the Persian Behistun text. By around 1850 there were dozens of well-established syllabic values to work with.

By a second lucky accident, the Behistun monument was — [like the Rosetta Stone ](https://www.quora.com/How-were-the-Hieroglyphics-deciphered/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=391c9e0f&srid=zLvM)— _trilingual._  It included the same message in Old Persian, the Babyonian dialect of Akkadian, and Elamite — and all three were written in cuneiform. The solid Persian reading enabled a generation of scholars to begin deciphering the other texts, armed with a handful of proper names, the sound values for several of the signs.

Since Akkadian was a Semitic language, related to well-known languages like Aramaic, this work went fairly quickly. There are a lot of cuneiform texts, including the vast cache from the [Library of Nineveh ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Ashurbanipal), so a whole generation of scholars were able to get in on the act. Thus, the basics of written Akkadian were established less than two decades after Rawlinson published his work on Behistun. A famous experiment at the Royal Asiatic Society in 1857 saw Rawlinson, [Julius Oppert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Oppert), [Edward Hincks ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hincks)and [Henry Fox Talbot ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fox_Talbot)given copies of the same inscription to translate and all producing substantially similar readings — proof that the basics of Akkadian cuneiform were on a firm scientific footing.

(This part of the story is, incidentally, very well told in [Empires of the Plain](https://amzn.to/2rULVZ6) by Lesley Adkins.)

__Sumerian__ 

So, by around 1860 Akkadian cuneiform was well understood — but that didn’t bring Sumerian back from the dead. Cuneiform is a writing system — not a language. The breakthrough in Akkadian cuneiform rendered Sumerian to some degree legible without making it intelligible.

Here’s where another piece of serendipity comes in.

We owe a great debt to the priests and scribes of the ancient Near East who painstakingly preserved Sumerian as a language of literature, religion and poetry long after it had died out as a living tongue. The deep conservatism of Mesopotamian literary culture kept Sumerian alive on clay long after it had died as a spoken language. So, as 19th century archaeologists began to systematically study cuneiform tablets they discovered [a tremendous number of bilingual Akkadian-Sumerian word lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_lists): study aids for the generations of young scribes who had to learn Sumerian in order to pass their school exams. It’s as if Latin had entirely died out and had to be reconstructed from copies of _[Wheelock’s Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelock%27s_Latin)_ __ or similar modern texts.

The cheat-sheets were incredibly useful. They frequently included not only the Akkadian and Sumerian words, but even guides to pronunciation and usage. These study aids and encyclopedias offered modern scholars a huge and ready-made corpus of Sumerian words with matches in Akkadian; thus, a large portion of the Sumerian vocabulary was reconstructed in fairly short order in the last decades of the nineteenth century.

However, Sumerian is apparently a complete language isolate with no living descendants. This put early students of the language in an interesting position: they could ‘read’ Sumerian texts — at least those which contained items from the word lists — with almost no understanding of their grammar and structure. It did not help that Sumerian cuneiform was more complex and less systematic than later cuneiform versions — it relied much more heavily on contextual clues, ideograms, and shorthands , all far harder to read than the neat, consistent syllables of Rawlinson’s Persian cuneiform.

This meant that Sumerian took a good deal longer to really unpack — in fact, from the 1870’s through the end of the nineteenth century not a few scholars, like [Joseph Halévy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hal%C3%A9vy), argued that the Sumerian texts were not a language at all, but a kind of cryptographic system.

It was not until the eve of World War I that scholars achieved a reliable, though still limited understanding of Sumerian as a language. Stereotyped inscriptions and things like proper names were already well understood, but more complex texts were very difficult to translate and didn’t really become common until the inter-war years. The most famous modern translations are those of [Samuel Noah Kramer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Noah_Kramer), which he began publishing in the 1940’s . [His books ](https://amzn.to/2AlcqeT)are still some of the most accessible reads of Sumerian texts. Even today, though, the finer points of the language are the subject of intense scholarly debate.

So — our ability to read Sumerian today is the lucky end product of both a lot of painstaking scholarship and a long chain of fortunate accidents. Without the link between Darius’s faux-cuneiform Persian to Akkadian and then the preservation of so many Akkadian-Sumerian word lists the language might still be a mystery today.

I’m not qualified to pass judgement on the accuracy of this reconstruction…



…but the fact that we could even attempt it is nothing short of astonishing.
