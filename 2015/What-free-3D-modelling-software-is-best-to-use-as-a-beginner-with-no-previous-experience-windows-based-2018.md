If you are just experimenting, blender (http://www.blender.org ) is very full featured and free, but a bit clunky. Maya http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview and Max http://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview offer student and trial versions at reduced cost. Houdini http://www.sidefx.com has a free version and is very good for algorithm driven modeling, but is more complex for conventional modeling and animation tasks
