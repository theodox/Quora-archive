Any take is bound to be subjective, my own included. That said, the odds of Alexander’s empire outliving him were never very good.

The Macedonian kingdom had risen to prominence under Alexander’s father Philip, and had taken a series of remarkable steps in the direction of institutional maturity. However if you rewind the calendar just one generation from Alexander’s death the picture looks pretty chaotic: the “kingdom” is very much dependent on the abilities of individual kings and the idea that Macedon was be a world power would have been almost laughable. This is the foundation on which Alexander had to build.

Consider the reign of Alexander’s father, Philip’s (r. 359–336 BC): a remarkable and somewhat unlikely success story.

There’s a tremendous irony in how this great conqueror started his career: he was a diplomatic hostage, a disposable younger son sent off as collateral for Macedon’s good behavior. Instead of learning the art of kingship at home, he was off in Thebes where he saw the strategic genius of [Epanimondas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epaminondas) and the battlefield panache of [Pelopidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelopidas) at first hand: probably a better introduction to his destiny than he could have gotten in Pella. The Argead Dynasty had a long, messy history of fratricidal succession fights: Between 400 BC and Philip’s accession in 359 there were 14 claimants to the throne and 4 distinct civil wars. Philip only claimed the throne after his eldest brother, [Alexander II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Macedon), was assassinated (after having lost much of his kingdom to a Thracian-backed relative, and only regained it with Athenian help). Alexander’s assassin was deposed with Theban help — that’s how Philip ended up in Thebes — and another brother [Perdiccas III ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdiccas_III_of_Macedon)placed on the throne as a Theban proxy. When Perdiccas died, Philip overthrew his infant nephew [Amyntas IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyntas_IV_of_Macedon) and took the throne himself. To give Philip credit, however, he didn’t have the child killed: an unusually restrained act for a Macedonian king.

Philip was unquestionably a political genius: he parlayed his tenuous toehold in this shaky kingdom into a near-complete hegemony over the Greek heartland. His military innovations were remarkable (though many of them ultimately go back to the Thebans of his youth, or to the innovative Athenian general [Iphicrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphicrates), who had saved the throne for Philip’s brother Alexander in the 360’s — still Philip was smart enough to know how to copy with style). He also labored mightily to create an efficient bureaucracy and a regular army and turn Macedon from a struggling, shambolic outpost into a first rate power.

Without question his creation clearly outclassed his rivals. Nonetheless, it was still a hothouse flower: outside the (few) cities the old Macedonian life of clan vendettas and frontier banditry went on unabated. His genius allowed him to bring most of Greece to heel — but not the rest of his countrymen. Like so many of his predecessors Philip was assassinated by a fellow Macedonian.

And, like so many of _his_ predecessors, Alexander inherited the throne with a host of potential rivals. He promptly removed a few of them, including the unfortunate Amyntas, a couple of cousins, and [Attalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attalus_(general)), Philip’s chief of staff. Alexander’s mother, meanwhile, had [Cleopatra Eurydice ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_Eurydice_of_Macedon)— Philip’s seventh and last wife — murdered along with her children.

_Olympias, Alexander’s mother, personally arranged the the death of at least six members of the royal family at different times. It was widely suspected in antiquity that she also arranged Philip’s assassination._ 

Meanwhile outside the messy confines of the royal family, Philip’s carefully constructed series of alliances and his nominal position as leader of the “[League of Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Corinth)” crumbled quickly: Alexander had to impose his will upon the league at swordpoint: the destruction of Thebes underlined the real basis of Macedonian hegemony in the Greek world in ways that nobody could miss.

None of this augurs well for Alexander’s empire. It would have taken a rare kind of brilliance to build something cohesive out of this inherently unstable power base. The civil wars and contested successions which follow Alexander’s death seem very much of a piece with the mores of the old Macedonian kingdom. The [extinction of his own heirs](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-the-descendants-of-Alexander-the-Great) was not much different than the messy events which followed his own rise to the throne. The baroque duplicity of the Successors and their kaleidoscopic series of alliances and betrayals was just an epically upscaled repeat of the factional double-dealing that had accompanied previous transfers of power.

The institutional framework which Philip had built actually did survive Alexander’s death, and it set the pattern for the royal bureaucracies of the Hellenistic era (it was Philip’s choice of Athenian scribes as his preferred pen-pushers which would eventually [create the common international “koine” Greek of future centuries](https://www.quora.com/Who-created-the-Koine-Greek-Writing-Why-was-it-written-more-like-Hieroglyphics-and-Demotic-than-its-mainland-Greece-dialectic-writing-Why-were-most-ancient-mainland-Greeks-not-able-to-read-Koine/answer/Steve-Theodore)). However this new organization was not strong enough or deep rooted enough to seriously contend against the warrior class that dominated Macedon and eventually the Successor kingdoms. The fascinating, tragic career of [Eumenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumenes) — Alexander’s chief secretary — is a perfect metaphor for the imbalanced relationship between the civil and military sides of Macedonian power. Eumenes was not a Macedonian, a point which Alexander’s generals and companions frequently threw in his face and which quite seriously hampered his career. The Athenian and Ionian scribes who managed Alexander’s correspondence, oversaw his logistics, and did his accounting were even farther removed from the social circles of the Macedonian warlords. Indeed, the only reason we know about Eumenes is that he managed to transform himself from a secretary into a warlord. Despite his civilian origins he proved to be the most innovative and wiliest — though, alas for him, not the most ruthless — of the Successor generals. His rise and fall are fodder for an amazing movie (albeit one with a downer ending) but also a sign of how institutionally immature Alexander’s kingdom really was: any sane set of would-be kings ought to have fallen all over themselves to keep Eumenes happy as a guarantor of bureaucratic stability — instead, they alternately patronized and bullied him until he turned himself into the only thing they respected: a brazen bandit.



With all of that said, it’s certainly possible that another ten or fifteen years on the throne — along with an heir old enough to command respect and loyalty — might have made a difference. Ptolemy managed to set his portion of the empire onto a fairly solid footing in a single generation. Macedon itself took a bit longer to give up its fratricidal ways: dynastic stability didn’t really settle in until [Antigonus II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigonus_II_Gonatas), almost fifty years after Alexander’s death. The Seleucid domains finally stabilized around the same time. A long reign and a surviving, competent heir are two of the key things that help any historical ruler avoid being relegated to the footnotes.

However, it’s worth noting that in all of these kingdoms the old Macedonian fondness for contested successions never really vanished: the Ptolemies, for example, were busy assassinating one another right up until the Romans arrived (Cleopatra fought a war with one brother, poisoned another, and had her sister executed). It was the combination of compact, manageable territories and sophisticated, entrenched bureaucracies which allowed those states to survive the chaos at the top.

Thus, it’s not absolutely impossible that Alexander’s empire could have remained as a super-sized version of what Ptolemaic Egypt eventually became. If he’d lived to sixty and his son Alexander had made it to adulthood, if he’d been able to tap the pre-existing governmental structures of Mesopotamia, Egypt and Iran (as Seleucus and Ptolemy did do) he might have ended up as another Cyrus. Nonetheless, given the dubious building materials and the greater structural stresses that come with such a vast and heterogeneous domain, it still seems to me that the odds were never very good. To be fair, his whole career was a statistical anomaly: does that mean he could have had pulled off both a military _and_  a civil miracle? Or is one one-in-a-million achievement all you have a right to expect?
