They actually used both swords and spears.

The defining weapon of the legions was the _pilum,_ which was primarily a throwing spear but could also be used as a thrusting weapon. Most legionaries carried two _pila_ in addition to the familiar shield and short swords. Ordinarily the legionaries would charge the enemy line, throwing their _pila_  from about 20 meters then drawing their swords to follow up. The pilum had a heavy iron head capable of punching through armor and shields. It was also designed with barbs like a fishhook to make it hard to dislodge if it were caught in a shield; a _pilum_  could still render an enemy shield useless even if it didn’t do any actual damage. The one-two punch of the _pilum_ followed by sword charge was the foundation of Roman tactics.

There were other spear types in use as well:

The most common was the _[hasta](http://specialweapons-rome.weebly.com/the-hasta.html)_ _,_ a six-foot or so fighting spear not meant for throwing. In the early Republic this was the primary weapon of the Roman soldier, but it was mostly replaced by the _pilum_ sometime before 250 BC. However the veteran reserve troops, or _[Triarii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triarii)_ _,_ continued to use the _hasta_ until about 100 BC.

The _[lancea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancea_(weapon))_ and the _[verutum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verutum)_ were javelins, shorter and lighter than the pilum or the hasta. These were primarily used by skirmishers and light troops.

Compared to, say, Greek infantry the Romans did rely more on the sword. This has a lot to do with the mountainous terrain of Italy, which was not favorable to the kind of tight-knit shoulder-to-shoulder pike formations that dominated Greek warfare. The Romans started off fighting in Greek-style spear phalanxes, but particularly after their [long wars against the Samnites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samnite_Wars) in the 4th century BC they adopted looser, more mobile formations which emphasized individual fighting instead of close-order shield pushes. The lack of heavy cavalry opponents also lessened the need for spears.
