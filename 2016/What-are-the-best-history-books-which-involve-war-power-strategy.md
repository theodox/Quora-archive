Thanks for the A2A. I'm Hardly an expert, but here's a few I've found striking.

 [Thucydides](http://amzn.to/1WZ8YJH). While the tactics are not particularly up to date the geo-politics and their intersection with psychology are pretty timeless. It's also marvellously understated: compared to most ancient authors Thucydides is not given to big rhetorical flourishes -- but his passion for material burns through his efforts at sounding detached, which makes it even more powerful. Donald Kagan's [Peloponessian War](http://amzn.to/1UVLQOo) is a modern bookend to Thucydides covering the same events from a modern perspective.

Edwin Luttwak's [The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire](http://amzn.to/1RMrbpo) and [The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire](http://amzn.to/1M2aNFt) are both very modern takes on an ancient subject, but they do a good job of applying a professional military outlook to the realities of ancient conditions.

The conclusions drawn in Alfred Thayer Mahan's [The Influence of Sea Power On History](http://amzn.to/1PGZa1i) are rather dated -- it's a book about force projection written before the aircraft and the submarine. It is, however, a good example of how a strong idea, strongly expressed can actually shape history as well as describe it: this was the handbook for many would-be imperialists at the end of the 19th century.

In the same period, but much less high level, Peter Hopkirk's [The Great Game: Struggle for Empire in Central Asia](http://amzn.to/1onAW5W) covers the fascinating and often very obscure machinations of the British, Russians, Germans and Persians in late-19th century India, Afghanistan and Central Asia. Some of it is eerily familiar in the 21st century.

Winston Churchill's [Marlborough](http://amzn.to/1RrEXly) -- a biography of his famous ancestor -- is an interesting example of a lost genre; the book about history written by an actual statesman. It was once not that uncommon for political leaders to be be actual authors addressing actual topics, rather than for them to be nothing but names emblazoned on ghost-written campaign materials. This lends the analysis of the complex military, diplomatic and domestic political juggling of the War of the Spanish Succession amazing verve and depth for a fairly arcane subject. Combined with the usual stentorian Churchill prose, it's a great read.
