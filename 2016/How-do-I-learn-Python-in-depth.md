Lots of great answers here, so I will try to touch on a couple of standouts that haven' tbeen mentioned:

[Python Module of the Week ](https://pymotw.com/2/index.html) comes in both [Python 2](https://pymotw.com/2/index.html) and [Python 3](https://pymotw.com/3/index.html) flavors. It's an exhaustive coverage of the Python standard library, so it covers a lot of the _breadth_ of Python -- everything from how to connect to an http server to how to use a database or format unicode text. It's also well written with good examples.

Check out some of Peter Norvig's [ipython notebooks](http://norvig.com/ipython/README.html) to get inspired about what Python can do with great efficiency and economy of effort.

Spend some time with [Raymond Hettinger's](http://pyvideo.org/speaker/138/raymond-hettinger) Python videos or his [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/raymondh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). He's one of core Python developers and he does a great job of covering code that is really _pythonic_  as opposed to just code that just happens to be Python. I'm particularly fond of [Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python](http://pyvideo.org/video/1780/transforming-code-into-beautiful-idiomatic-pytho), which is also linked in [Cody Jackson](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cody-Jackson-13)'s answer. It's a key to getting from 'competent' to 'confident' in Python.
