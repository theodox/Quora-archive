# Why are Russia and France such minor players in Battlefield 1? Did anyone at EA bother to look up WW1 before making a game about it?

With the caveat that I don’t have any first-hand information of any kind, I’d suggest a couple of possibilities:

The Anglophone market is way bigger than the Francophone one (the UK market alone is about 25% bigger than the French one one in sales terms). The Russian language market is far smaller: it’s a [tough, piracy-ridden market](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6565/gunning_for_russia_a_market_worth_.php?print=1) for PC games and the [console market is even dicier](http://kotaku.com/5955739/welcome-to-russia-where-most-of-your-friends-are-video-game-pirates), since it’s effectively out of reach of a lot of people’s ability to pay legitimately. So I’d assume that the decision was to go with the Anglophone powers first reflects revenue predictions.

With that background, I suspect the the decision to do the French forces as a DLC probably is a way of maximizing revenue: it’s a DLC which will probably do pretty well in any market with an emotional tie to WWI and especially well in France — whereas I don’t think that say, including France but not Austria-Hungary in the base game will significantly impact sales in North America or the English speaking world.

I’d be willing to bet that the inclusion of Austria, Turkey and Italy has as much to do with map-making as history: if you want something more dramatic than brown, muddy trenches you need Caporetto, the Adriatic, Palestine and Gallipoli. Otherwise it’s mud and barbed wire and not much else.

Unlike WWII, Russian memories of WWI are blunted by subsequent history — German players might give a damn about Tannenberg, but Russophile players might not even recognize the name. And, like the western front it’s pretty flat terrain.

All that said, it’s a damn shame.

Of course I will be eagerly awaiting a [Monastir DLC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastir_Offensive)so I can chase fat King Carol back over Vardar where he belongs.
