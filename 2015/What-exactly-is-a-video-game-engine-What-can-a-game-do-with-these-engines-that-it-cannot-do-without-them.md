In the earliest days of the business, every game was a completely custom piece of software with every design and content decision implemented directly, by hand, in the code: really old games frequently include the pictures and sounds directly in the code as big blobs of numbers.

As with everything, there were exceptions, like the Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI), by Sierra On-Line, originally developed as the game engine for King's Quest (1984).

As PC games broadened the base of the business, past the one-off coin-op games and tightly coupled console hardware and software, people started to notice that big portions of the game code were really re-usable. [John Carmack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack) is usually credited with the term "game engine", which was his term for splitting the reusable aspects the game programming from the parts which were best left to other specialists: artists, designers, and sound people could add their own contributions to the game without writing actual program code.

Nowadays, as the other answers point out, commercial engines like [Unity ](https://unity3d.com/)or the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4) are used by many companies and also by hobbyist developers who want to focus on game content (story, artwork, music or game design) rather than on hard-core software and graphics programming.
