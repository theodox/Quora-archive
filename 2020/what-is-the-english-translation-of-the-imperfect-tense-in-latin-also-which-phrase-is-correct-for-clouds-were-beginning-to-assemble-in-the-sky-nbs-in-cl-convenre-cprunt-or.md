In English we are less sensitive to Latin’s hard distinction between the imperfect and perfect. Latin uses verb tense to stress the difference between past-action-extended-in-time (imperfect) and past-action-completed (perfect) where we rely on a couple of different mechanisms for this.

The closest English analogue is a [past progressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_of_English_verb_forms#Past_progressive)— in the phrases above _nubes in caelo convenire incipiebant_  can definitely be done as “clouds were beginning to gather in the sky”. But this tense rarely makes a simple 1:1 translation.

So the translator can — in the right context — use the plain old past tense when it flows better as long as the distinction between a _completed_ past action and and a past action extended over some time is maintained. This reflects the way English just doesn’t care as much about the distinction between complete and ongoing actions in the past. So in this case the _nubes in caelo convenire incipiebant_ could be rendered as “clouds started to gather in the sky” ___if___ ____ you put it in a passage where it didn’t break the original intent to show the gathering as a _process_ and not something that just happened and was done.

Other ways English expresses the imperfect idea are phrases like “always” or “used to.” So in the right context

_domum ibat Tertia Via_ 

might be “s/he was going home by Third Avenue,” but it could also be “used to go home by Third Avenue” or “always went home by Third Avenue” or “kept going home by Third Avenue.” The right translation really depends on the rest of the passage. The key thing about the imperfect is that it emphasizes __ongoing action rather than__  __done-ness__ .

All that said: for a single-sentence translation exercise the old standby _was ______-ing_ indicates that you see the difference between the perfect and imperfect. Contrariwise _nubes in caelo convenire coeperunt_ is “the clouds _began_  to gather in the sky”
