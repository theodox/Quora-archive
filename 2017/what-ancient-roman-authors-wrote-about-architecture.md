The big one is [Vitruvius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/vitruvius/home.html)’ _de Architectura_ , which is available online at the link. It’s a rare example of a practical technical book from antiquity; in general, the literary classes of the Roman Empire didn’t bother themselves with that kind of practical stuff, which was left for the grubby members of the lower classes. However architecture was prestigious enough (since lots of Roman aristocrats had fancy villas, or wanted to commission show public buildings) that Vitruvius made it into a lot of libraries.

Another one is [Frontinus,](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/frontinus/de_aquis/text*.html) who left one on the building and administration of the Roman aqueduct system.

There are bits and pieces in other places, but those are the big ones. There’s some stuff in [Columella’s](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/columella/home.html) book on agriculture about farmhouse design. [Marcus Terentius Varro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Terentius_Varro) wrote an architecture book but it’s lost.

These links are to the books themselves (in English) . You should be able to find the biographies pretty easily using the names.
