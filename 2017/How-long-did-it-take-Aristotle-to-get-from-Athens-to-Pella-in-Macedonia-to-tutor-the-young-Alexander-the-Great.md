If you’re talking travel time, the journey on foot would probably have been about 18 days, and a voyage by sea would have been about about a week in good summer weather — at least according to [The Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World](http://orbis.stanford.edu/), which should be pretty good for this period.

It might be wise to add a couple of extra days to the journey in Alexander’s time because the political fragmentation of Greece before the Roman conquest may add some friction to the journey.
