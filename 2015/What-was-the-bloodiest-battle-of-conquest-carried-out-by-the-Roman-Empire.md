For sheer bloodshed, it's probably the capture of Carthage at the end of the third Punic War in 146 BC. This was, however, not a single 'battle' but a siege that lasted more than two years. At the beginning of the campaign the city of Carthage had a population of 500,000*. At the end of the siege, which lasted over two years, the survivors numbered only 50,000. The level of destruction was far more complete and vindictive than the Roman norm: they deliberately razed the entire city and [ritually cursed the site](https://ancientcarthage.wikispaces.com/The+Destruction+of+Carthage-+Scipio%27s+Curse) to render it uninhabitable. Ordinarily the Romans preferred a defeated and submissive client to annihilation -- but Carthage was Rome's greatest rival and enemy, and the Romans had [had also convinced themselves -- probably wrongly -- that Carthage had treacherously reneged on an earlier surrender](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Rome-destroy-Carthage).

If you're thinking of bloodshed on a single day, probably the [Battle of Vercellae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vercellae) (101 BC), where Marius defeated the Cimbri -- killing or capturing a combined 200,000 people. It's a bookend Marius' battle a year earlier at [Aquae Sextiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aquae_Sextiae) against another Germanic tribe, the Teutones, which also accounted for 110,000.

 These battles were exceptionally bloody because German tribes were moving as whole peoples -- entire nations, rather than just armies on the move (at Aquae Sextiae, many captured women killed themselves and their children rather than submitting to slavery -- an act which left a powerful mark on the Roman imagination).

* All ancient numbers are famously inaccurate, but there's no reason to think these numbers are worse than others.
