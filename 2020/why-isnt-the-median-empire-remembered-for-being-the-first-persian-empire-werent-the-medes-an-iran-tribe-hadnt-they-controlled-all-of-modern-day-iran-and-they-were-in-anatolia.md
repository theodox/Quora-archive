The Medes were an Iranic people, but they weren’t “Persians”. Persians proper were the inhabitants of Parsis, the part of modern Iran that’s roughly equivalent to [Fars Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fars_Province) in the mountainous southwest of the country. The Medes came from Mada, which is in the north of Iran closer to the Caspian Sea. Linguistically the two groups were related but not identical — Median is not well preserved but it’s a different language from Old Persian. The relationship is roughly similar to the difference between modern Kurdish, also a northwest-Iranic language, and modern Farsi, which is southwest-Iranic.

The [relationship between Medes and Persians was complex and ambiguous](https://www.quora.com/Is-one-man-s-Mede-another-man-s-Persian/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=079d57f2&srid=zLvM). There were clear elements of cultural and linguistic similarity but also of rivalry; you can see the succession of Median-Persian-Parthian-Sassanian reflects a seesaw of influence between the north and south of the Iranian plateau.

To outsiders the differences were often obscure — Greek and Romans use “Mede” and “Persian” interchangeably most of the the time — but the differences will have been fairly clear to people within Iran. You can think of the Greek terminology like the Arabic habit of referring to all Europeans as “Franks” or the European habit of seeing everybody south of the Mediterranean as “Moors.” It’s probably also why later Persian sources felt no awkwardness referring to Alexander as “Roman”.
