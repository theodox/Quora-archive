# What exactly happened to the Argyraspides or "Silver Shields" after the Wars of the Diadochi? Is it conceivable that some of them could have been sold into slavery to space aliens like the defeated Romans in David Drake's "Ranks of Bronze"?

Clearly, the cover story was tight enough to deceive Plutarch:

> Eumenes thus slain, on no other man than Antigonus himself did Heaven devolve the punishment of the soldiers and commanders who betrayed him, but he himself, regarding the Silver-shields as impious and bestial men, put them into the violence of Sibyrtius the governor of Arachosia, ordering him to wear them out and destroy them in every possible way, that not a man of them might ever return to Macedonia or behold the Grecian sea.

[Plutarch, Life of Eumenes, 19.2](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/eumenes*.html)

_Obviously, a coverup. Arachosia (roughly modern Helmand province in Afghanistan) is a well-known extraterrestrial hot-spot; you can see the obvious “ancient astronaut” pose in this tetradrachm from Quetta. The alien “pilot” here is clearly wearing Apollo-style headgear, while on the reverse of the coin he is manipulating the controls of his craft._ 

If they aliens got the Silver-shields, both sides probably got what they deserved; they were an ornery band of bastards. As Eumenes told them as they dragged him off to his doom:

> May the gods, then, the avengers of perjury, look down in judgement upon you, ye accursed wretches, and bring upon you such deaths as you have brought upon your leaders. It was you, the same who now stand before me, that were lately sprinkled with the blood of Perdiccas, and that planned a similar end for Antipater. You would even have killed Alexander himself, if it had been possible for him to fall by a mortal hand: what was next to it, you harassed him with your mutinies. I, the last victim of your perfidy, now pronounce on you these curses and imprecations: may you live your whole lives in poverty, far from your country, in this camp where you are exiled; and may your own arms, by which you have killed more generals of your own than of your enemies, sink you in utter destruction.
