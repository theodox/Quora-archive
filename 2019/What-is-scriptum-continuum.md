It’s usually written as _scriptio continua,_ which translates as “continuous writing.” It’s the way ancient and medieval scribes wrote without word breaks or punctuation:

It’s a fairly common situation in many different writing systems down the ages. In Latin script, for example, spacing and punctuation in the modern manner did not become common until the late middle ages.
