The Spartans basically turned down the chance to lead an ongoing war against Persia.

After the Greek victory at [Plataea](http://www.livius.org/articles/battle/plataea-479-bce/), the allied army chased the Persians northwards out of mainland Greece. They fought a succesful battle at [Mycale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mycale#The_Greeks) and captured the towns of Byzantion on the European side of the Bosporus.

However, the Spartans quickly lost their enthusiasm for the war. There are several overlapping reasons for this. They’d never maintained a serious expeditionary force before: the whole _raison d’etre_  of the Spartan military was not foreign conquest but keeping the [helots](https://www.quora.com/How-long-did-the-Spartans-have-slaves) down — and with a significant fraction of the Spartan military caste off in Asia Minor, the leadership began to get nervous. Perhaps equally important was the worry that [Pausanias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pausanias_(general)), the Spartan victor at Plataea, was getting a bit too big for his britches. There were rumors that he had colluded with the Persians during the siege of Byzantion, and some people even believed that he’d offered to turn his coat and work for the Persians against the Greek cause.

That last one is unlikely to be true (the Spartans recalled him but exonerated him of those charges). Even if false, though, the rumors reflect a deep unease about what victory was doing to the Spartan military: the famously ascetic, simple life of the Spartan warrior was a harder sell to soldiers who had seen first hand the lush life of the Persian nobility. [Herodotus tells this story](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0016,001:9) about Pausanias in the first flush of victory:

> This other story is also told. When Xerxes fled from Hellas, he left to Mardonius his own establishment. Pausanias, seeing Mardonius' establishment with its display of gold and silver and gaily colored tapestry, ordered the bakers and the cooks to prepare a dinner such as they were accustomed to do for Mardonius. They did his bidding, but Pausanias, when he saw golden and silver couches richly covered, and tables of gold and silver, and all the magnificent service of the banquet, was amazed at the splendor before him, and for a joke commanded his own servants to prepare a dinner in Laconian fashion. When that meal, so different from the other, was ready, Pausanias burst out laughing and sent for the generals of the Greeks. When these had assembled, Pausanias pointed to the manner in which each dinner was served and said: “Men of Hellas, I have brought you here because I desired to show you the foolishness of the leader of the Medes who, with such provisions for life as you see, came here to take away from us our possessions which are so pitiful.” In this way, it is said, Pausanias spoke to the generals of the Greeks.

But that contrast didn’t hold. During the campaign in the north Pausanias became increasingly haughty and unapproachable; he even [dropped his Spartan costume for luxurious Persian outfits and held court like a king](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0247%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D130) (though a member of the royal house, Pausanias was not one of Sparta’s kings). To the conservative ruling classes of Sparta this was a terrifying prospect — not only the possible subversion of their most successful general, but the incipient rot of their whole value system.

So, the Spartans quickly tired of the war against Persia. Mycale was the last military success of the united Greek command; not long afterwards the Spartan king Leotychides actually proposed transplanting the Greek population of Asia Minor back to the mainland as a way of ‘freeing’ them from the Persians — a plan which can’t be seen as much more than a face-saving cover for the abandonment of the traditional Spartan leadership role. The Athenians — buoyed by their military success (in particular, by their lead role at Salamis and Mycale) and culturally much closer to the Ionians — were willing to pick up the mantle that the Spartans had dropped.
