Suprisingly little has changed in the core modeling-rigging-animation workflow. If you look at Max and Maya — and Blender, which is kind of a running average of the two — they’re still pretty close to their mid-90’s roots (for example, they are not is fully multicore). The workflows have gotten incrementally better but they are still recognizably they same programs they were back then. The community around the programs has gotten infinitely more sophisticated and much of the best development for Max and Maya happens out in the wild, rather than at ADSK.

The biggest disruption in that time frame has been the rise of programs like [ZBrush](http://pixologic.com/) and [3D Coat](http://3dcoat.com/home/), which really do change the way modelers work — particularly on high poly characters where sculptural freedom and surface texture are essential. Both of those are invaluable for almost any modern film or game production, but neither one really replaces the conventional Max-Maya type all-in-one apps; the work they create is usually going to consumed by another program which will do animation, simulations and effects work.

Another, less popular but very powerful disruptor is [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/), which is a very left-brained procedural modeling and effects package. It’s even more abstract and techy than Max or Maya — but it’s super-powerful procedural tools can do really amazing things in the right hands. It’s pretty niche in games, but it’s very important in VFX production.

Rendering tech has improved a lot in the last decade; there’s been a prolifieration of highend renders with [Turtle](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/ENU/123112/files/turtle-html.html) and [Arnold](https://www.solidangle.com/) joining the old Maya renderer, Mental Ray and Renderman as options.

Dynamics simulations — physics, hair, and cloth — have gotten a lot more sophisticated in the last decade as well; all of these existed back in 2002 but they were slow, buggy and highly technical. Now they are faster and less buggy, but still a demanding specialty. Nevertheless the improvements are real — OTOH Maya’s built-in cloth pales next to something dedicated like [Marvelous Designer](http://www.marvelousdesigner.com/).

Ultimately, the 3d market has really slowed down in the last decade. Even though lots more people use the software, it’s a pretty uncompetitive market (Max and Maya, and the late lamented SoftimageXSI, are owned by the same company; this has really reduced the pressure to innovate). And since so much work has been done by studios that use Max or Maya as platforms, the incentive to switch to some new upstart is very limited — the lock in effect of a decades worth of bespoke pipeline tools is very daunting.

Barring somebody coming out of left field with a real killer app, I suspect this is going to stay pretty much in the same rut for the forseeable future.
