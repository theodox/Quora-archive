# If we weren't taught history in school, is there any proof that we would actually make the same mistakes as our ancestors?

<sarcastic answer>

Given the level of ambient historical knowledge in contemporary culture, and the speed with which we seem to re-invent the mistakes of our ancestors, the proof is all around us.

_“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”, by Rene Magritte, Smithsonian Museum, 1962_ 

In a more serious vein:

The notion that _those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it_  has very little to do with the reason history is taught in schools. The kind of history taught in primary or secondary school has almost nothing to do with “learning from the past;” it’s actually a lot more like a what you get in Sunday School. It provides a series of parables, intended to create a sense of community and shared purpose. This kind of history is there to illustrate a particular view of how things ought to work — to teach you that _Democracy Is Good_ or _Racism Is Bad_ (or, less pleasantly, _Those People Did Mean Things To Us And It’s All Their Fault_ ). The lessons of the past you’re supposed to be learning are not timeless pieces of wisdom— not even “[never get involved in a land war in Asia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LUUk6wVNrY).” They are the lessons that the school wants you to learn in order to help you grow into a particular kind of citizen.

Don’t misunderstand: that’s not a bad thing. Democracy Is Good and Racism Is Bad, and 10th grade history is one of the many ways we try to teach those lessons. Communities telling stories about themselves and their shared values is one of the basic activities of humankind, and has been since the last Ice Age.

But… it is a different job altogether than the one which the famous quote (usually attributed to [George Santayana ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santayana)) is imagining.

Santayana was imagining a kind of historical study devoted to recognizing fundamental patterns in human affairs and — hopefully — to teaching us to make better choices. You look at the way the French Revolution produces Napoleon, and you can expect that the Russian Revolution will produce Stalin; knowing both, you may conclude that your Glorious People’s Uprising Of Lower Slobovia is going to end in military dictatorship rather than prosperity and equality. Hopefully you’ll concoct some other tactic.

This isn’t a difficult concept — it’s a basic reflection of how humans learn. Experiences — especially bad ones — are critical learning tools. People tend not to return to restaurants where they’ve had food poisoning, or to revisit streets where they’ve been mugged. Just enlarge those basic facts up to a societal scale and you get “learning from history.”

The problem, of course, is knowing when you’re using the _right_  lessons from history to guide your decision making. More often than not the same very small stock of familiar analogies gets trotted out in every crisis — it sometimes seems like everything is either Another Vietnam or Isolationism 2.0.

Now, most people can agree that avoiding both of those scenarios is a good thing. Unfortunately, it does not take much insight to realize that they hardly encompass the complete range of political and military outcomes, even in the narrow realm of American foreign policy.

Which brings us back to the heart of the question: why study history?

The best reason for studying history is not that it provides a set of obvious, cut-and-dried answers for all possible questions. It doesn’t. The best reason for studying history is that it does offer a huge range of possible analogies to help you understand your own world. These are analogies, not precise formulas. But they do help you sharpen your thinking and force you to examine the facts in front of you from more than one or two tired old angles. More than anything else, learning _means_  learning from experience. The job of history is to provide a broader range of experiences you can learn _from_ .
