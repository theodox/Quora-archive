All good answers, and [Alexandros Mastas](https://www.quora.com/profile/Alexandros-Mastas) covers the main types of Athenian fighters well. 

It's worth adding, though, that during the classical era (usually defined as the interval between the Athenian victory at Marathon in 490 BC and the fall of Athens at the end of the Peloponessian war in 404 BC) the most characteristic Athenian force was the navy, rather than the army.

Republic of Rowers

The Athenian navy, was uniquely democratic. Unlike the army - which was deeply connected to social status since soldiers provided their own armor and weapons -- the navy was open to everyone. In practice rich citizens would appear as officers or hoplite marines, but unlike the regular land army the bulk of the navy was drawn from the working class. The 'galley slaves' you might imagine from _Ben Hur_  were found in some rival navies but the Athenians were proud of the fact that their ships were manned by free citizens -- the superior performance of the Athenian navy during most of their golden age reflected the willing and intelligent participation of people who in other Greek cities would never have had a stake in a fight.

The Athenian navy was, in large part, a kind of government jobs program. It really began when the Athenians discovered a valuable silver vein at [Laurium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurium) in 486BC. [Themistocles](http://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/characters/themistocles_p7.html) -- the wiliest of Athenian politicians -- convinced the city to spend the money on a large new fleet instead of distributing it as a one-time bonus. He was thinking of Athens' arch-rival [Aegina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegina), just over the water -- but also of the Persians who had landed an invasion fleet on Athens' coast just four years earlier. He clinched the deal by making sure that the navy would be manned by paid citizen rowers -- which guaranteed a strong vote in the assembly from the working class who saw the navy as a reliable employer.

The new fleet was tested in the [second Persian invasion of Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Persian_invasion_of_Greece) in 480 BC (the same one made famous, if barely recognizable, in _300)._ The Athenian fleet (led by Themistocles, who was as wily a general as he was a politician) was the key to stunning Greek victory at [Salamis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis), which destroyed the Persian fleet and forced the Persians onto the defensive. Naval leadership meant that the Athenians, rather than the Spartans, ended up driving the Greek counter-offensive against Persia. Over the generation from 480 to 450 that leadership gradually transformed into an empire in all but name: the strong Athenian fleet dominated the islands and coastal cities of Greece and Asia Minor. The fleet protected and expanded Athenian trade and provided the power to intervene on behalf for friends everywhere from Libya to the Black Sea.

Because the Athenian empire depended on the navy, the Athenian state had to reflect the wishes of the working people who manned the triremes. The Athenian writer Xenophon put it like this:



> It is right that the poor and the ordinary people there should have more power than the noble and the rich, because it is the ordinary people who man the fleet and bring the city her power; they provide the helmsmen, the boatswains, the junior officers, the look-outs and the shipwrights; it is these people who make the city powerful much more than the hoplites and the noble and respectable citizens. This being so, it seems just that all should share in public office by lot and by election, and that any citizen who wishes should be able to speak in the Assembly

'
One of the most jarring things to read about in Athenian sources is the fact that 'democracy' and 'aggressive imperialism' are almost synonymous: the working classes liked the empire, because it empowered them. The rich and influential were much less enthusiastic for foreign adventures.

Ramming Speed

_Although this is photoshopped, the ship is real: it's a_ _[reconstructed trireme built by the Greek navy](http://www.hellenicnavy.gr/en/history-tradition/ships-museum-exhibits/trireme-olympias)_ _in the 1980s'._ 

Classical [trireme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trireme) galleys were built long and slim, like racing shells - for short bursts they could top 9 knots (somewhat over 10 miles per hour), and they could turn around in less than three times their length. They carried a crew of about 170 sailors and a 30 marines. Most navies of the ancient era relied on grappling tactics - essentially ramming and boarding then fighting a land battle. The Athenians however perfected precise, coordinated tactics based around the beaked ram at the front of the ship : at full speed the mass of a 70-ton trireme could shear right through the hull of an opposing ship (another common tactic was to slide along side the enemy vessel at speed , breaking its oars and leaving it helpless). At the height of their power they routinely bested fleets three or four times their size. 

Unfortunately for Athens, the fatal link between naval power and expansionism led to increasingly aggressive behavior. Not only did the city alienate many potential allies, it launched an unprovoked and foolhardy [invasion of Sicily](http://www.livius.org/pb-pem/peloponnesian_war/sicilian_expedition.html). The invasion failed, and the cream of the Athenian navy lost trying to sustain the beachhead far from home. The combination of Spartan arms, Sicilian ships and eventually Persian gold wore down the once mighty Athenian navy in the years between 413 and 405. 

The last great Athenian fleet was destroyed by overconfidence and poor command at [Aegospotami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aegospotami) in 405, leading directly to the surrender of Athens to the Spartans and the temporary end of the Athenian democracy. However the remnants of the scattered naval forces banded together under [Thrasybulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrasybulus) and freed Athens from the [Thirty Tyrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Tyrants) in 403 -- proving that the link between naval power and democracy remained unbreakable. The Athenians remained a notable naval power until they faded into irrelevance after the collapse of Alexander the Great's empire, though they never regained the complete dominance of the sea they enjoyed between 480 and 415.
