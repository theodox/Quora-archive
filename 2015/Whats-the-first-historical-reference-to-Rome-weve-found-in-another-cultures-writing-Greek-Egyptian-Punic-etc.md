Rome shows up surprisingly late. The Phoenicians, Greeks and Etruscans were the neighbors who dealt with early Rome the most. The Egyptians had lost their independence to the Persians before the Republic was founded (although some people think that they Egyptians hired Sardinians or "Sherdana" as mercenaries as early as the 13th c. BC). The Persians never really made much of an effort to investigate anything further west than Greece, particularly once they found the Greeks in their way.

Greek sources: The earliest known reference to Rome by a Greek author is probably by [Timaeus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(historian)), a Greek writer from Sicily who wrote around 300 BC. An alternate hypothetical candidate is [Antiochus of Syracuse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_of_Syracuse) who lived about a century earlier. Neither of their works survives except in quotations by later writers.

Phoenicians: The [Pyrgi Tablets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrgi_Tablets) are not exactly a 'mention' of Rome, but they are sometimes regarded as evidence for a treaty (mentioned by Polybius) between Rome and Carthage conducted around 500 BC. The tablets are in Punic and Etruscan.

Etruscans: The [Fran√ßois Tomb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Tomb) from the 4th century BC contains an image of [Caelius Vibenna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caelius_Vibenna), who figures in the legendary pre-history of Rome, and someone identified as 'Cneve Tarchunies Rumach' or 'Gnaeus Tarquinius of Rome'.

_Gnaeus Tarquinius far right._
