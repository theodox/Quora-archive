Athens started the war under the leadership of [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles), the most successful politician of the democratic era. He was able to keep the Athenian people committed to a basically defensive strategy that suited their geographical position and naval strength. However the crowding and short rations involved in keeping the whole population of Attica inside the city walls brought on a plague, which terrorized and demoralized the city and, in 429, killed Pericles too. 

After that Athenian politics returned to its ordinary pattern, which was an erratic jump between populist leaders like [Cleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleon) and aristocrats like [Nicias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicias), with the occasional self-serving adventurer like [Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades) in between. 

The war lasted for an entire generation, so politics returned to its usual very rough-and-tumble course with a lot of faction fighting, intrigue and personal vendettas. Alicibiades, the most talented Athenian general, was hounded into exile by his political enemies, switched sides and worked with the Spartans, then switched again and led a successful overthrow of an unpopular aristocratic government in Athens. Not long after he lost a battle -- his first major defeat -- and fled into exile again. Other losing generals were executed. As you can imagine, this didn't always encourage the most imaginative leadership.

 The lack of a solid, long-term policy helped to ensure the city's defeat because th different camps advocated wildly different policies; attempts at compromise often produced a worse outcome than either extreme: the classic case is the [Sicilian Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Expedition): the demagogues wanted to launch a risky (and unjustifed) attack on Syracuse; the conservatives tried to dissuade the Assembly by inflating the size of the proposed force -- the net result was a huge, unwieldy force led by a reluctant general which was lost in its entirety, permanently crippling the Athenian war effort.

The Spartans were lead by two sets of kings (they always had two kings at a time, from two different royal houses). The standout figures were [Archidamus II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archidamus_II), who had a similar reputation to Pericles for being rational and far-sighted: he opposed the war before it started and advocated a conciliatory approach during the fighting; but he died around the same time as Pericles. His co-king [Pleistoanax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistoanax) was accused of taking bribes from the Athenians and was forcibly retired, ostensibly for religious reasons. The real political power in Sparta was not the kings but the [Ephors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephor), an elected council that rotated every year. Individual ephors are usually not known, Spartan politics was much more subdued and less flamboyant than the Athenian version. 

The standout military leaders in Sparta were [Brasidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasidas) and [Lysander](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Lysander). Spartan discipline tended to encourage very straightforward tactics; Brasidas in particular was noted for having a more subtle strategic approach (and, very unusual for a Spartan, for being a decent politician. Lysander, on the other hand, was a clever admiral but roundly hated as a governor)
