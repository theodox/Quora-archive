Latin is great at short phrases like that.

“Come and take [them]” with be ___veni aufer___ with no ‘them’; since Latin didn’t regularly use articles like ‘the’ or ‘a’ the lack of a clear object in the sentence would not bother Latin speakers very much.

If you were sure the audience would be a group and not one person, ___venite auferte___
