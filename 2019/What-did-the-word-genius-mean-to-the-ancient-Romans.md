“Spirit” is a good general purpose translation, because the English word is a bit vague and — depending on who you talk to — could mean something fairly abstract (“the spirit of the age”) or something very distinct and supernatural (“I summon the spirits!”). The Latin has a similar range of potential meanings.

The older usages tend to be heavily connected with particular __places__ ; in fact one of the most common places for _genius_  to turn up in Latin is the phrase _[genius loci](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genius_loci)_ _, “the spirit of (a) place”._ Depending on who you asked, this was could refer to the dimly felt aura of a particular location — the hush of a sacred grove, say — or to an actual ‘spirit’ who looked after the place and needed to be propitiated with sacrifices. A Shinto shrine in rural Japan might provide a good analogy.

The other meaning of genius emphasizes a more personal kind of spirit, more or less a “__guardian angel__ ” — a supernatural entity which watched over a community, a family, or an individual. So for example you might find an altar to the _genius_ of a town council or a guild. This protective function overlapped heavily with the traditional belief in the [Lares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lares), the spirits of departed ancestors who watched over families and communities — some scholars believed that _genius_  shares an etymology with _gens_ , the Roman clan.

In any case, the genius of an individual or family played the role of guardian spirit or patron saint. This traditional idea was how the Roman emperors slyly introduced emperor-worship to a Roman populace that had no tradition of divinizing rulers. For example Ovid notes this in the Fasti for the Kalends of May:

> In the City there are a thousand Lares, and the Genius of The Leader, who handed them over to the public

which is a reference to that the annual celebration of the [Compitalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compitalia): emperor Augustus added his own _genius_  to the twin _lares_  that protected each of Rome’s 256 _vici_  or neighborhoods. Technically the offerings in the Compitalia (and other early imperial festivals in which the emperor’s genius played a part) were prayers and offerings _on behalf of_ the emperor, though over the next century they morphed into prayers and offerings _to_  the emperor.

_The altar of the_ Genius Augusti_(‘the genius of the emperor’) at Pompeii. Already, by AD 79, the imperial genius was getting a very elaborate sacrifice — note the bull, the most expensive sacrifice in Roman religion — a long way from the honey-cake or a cup of wine that a traditional Roman genius could expect.

There’s a third, but much less common meaning which means roughly “__wit__ ” or “__intelligence__ ” or “__talent__ ”. That one is quite rare but it shows up in Martial and Juvenal, two poets whose work was very popular in the Renaissance. Their sixteenth and seventeenth century admirers liked to quote that meaning and that’s how the modern English word emerged.
