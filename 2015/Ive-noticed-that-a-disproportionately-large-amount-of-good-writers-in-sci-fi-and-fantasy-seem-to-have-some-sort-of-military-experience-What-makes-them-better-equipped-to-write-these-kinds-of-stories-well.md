# I've noticed that a disproportionately large amount of good writers in sci fi and fantasy seem to have some sort of military experience. What makes them better equipped to write these kinds of stories well?

(thx for A2a) I agree with [Ernest W. Adams](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ernest-W-Adams) and [Joel Ruggaber](https://www.quora.com/profile/Joel-Ruggaber) -- there's two interlocking selection biases at work. 

In the early days of the genre, military service was vastly more common than it is today. Much 'golden age' SF was the product of the universal conscription era (and, interestingly some of the premier writers of the 40's and 50's served _together--_  [Isaac Asimov, Sprague de Camp and Robert Heinlein](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/asimov-de-camp-and-heinlein-naval-aviation-experim/) all worked together for the Navy)

_de Camp, Heinlein, and Asimov_ 

In the pointy-rocket-ships era space exploration and aeronautical engineering were even more closely tied to the military than they are today, so many people with technical interests also served: [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke#World_War_II), for example, was a radar operator. So a lot of the early flavor of the genre was established in a quasi-military context. 

Of course, there's also a lot of selection bound up with how you define "good" --- plenty of great SF / Fantasy has no obvious military component. If you like space opera or heroic fantasy where armies clash and empires fall --- well, a military background is a big help in getting the tone right. If you prefer the hard-science route, the alternate-visions-of-humanity-and-society business, or you're partial to dragons, harps and unicorns -- well, none of those really benefits from a trip through basic.
