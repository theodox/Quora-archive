The Assyrian and Babylonian empires used mass deportation as a deliberate strategy for breaking up subject peoples and scattering them far and wide. The deportees would be weakened and would have a hard time making common cause with other, equally uprooted communities in exile and opposing their imperial masters. The deportation of the Jews was just an application of the standard Assyrian/Babylonian tactic for weakening occupied countries (the kingdom of Judah, at this time, was a very minor power caught on the wrong side of a larger struggle between Babylonia, Assyria and Egypt).

When Cyrus defeated the Babylonians in ~540, he was an outsider who suddenly found himself in charge of a sprawling multinational empire. He wisely made his own task easier by ruling with a light hand and respecting local traditions where possible. Cyrus also followed the Mesopotamian tradition of presenting a new dynasty as a restoration of traditional rights and justice: The [Cyrus Cylinder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Cylinder) , which Cyrus set up in Babylon following his conquests, speaks of restoring destroyed temples and returning exiles to their homelands as part of Cyrus' restoration of justice which his Babylonian predecessor had perverted.

 Allowing the Jews (and other exiled nations) to return home was an easy way to earn their loyalty while depriving the conquered Babylonians of resources they might use in rebellion. The combined Persian-Babylonian empire was the largest in history up to that time, stretching from the Caspian Sea to the Indian Ocean and from Kyrgyzstan to the Mediterranean; as a small minority in their own vast domains the Persians had to conciliate local feelings and this was an excellent way to do so.
