[Tonios Kaleem](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tonios-Kaleem)'s answer catches the major point of difference: the Nile was a generally predictable and benign presence in Egypt, where it regulated the seasons and agricultural life with great regularity and a reassuring sense of order. The Tigris and Euphrates flow faster and occasionally overflow their banks (many Mesopotamian sites show clear signs of big innundations in the past; old Mesopotamian texts often date things "before the flood"). Both countries tended to need strong central governments to cope with annual flooding; but the differences in the behavior of the rivers led to very different forms.

The other big difference is that Egypt has effectively only three short, easily defensible borders: to the east, the coast road through Pelusium, to the west the Nile delta, and to the south the cataracts at Elephantine. The rest of the Nile Valley is flanked with brutal deserts, highly unsuitable to moving an invading army.

In contrast Mesopotamia is a big open area with vague boundaries, accessible on three sides:

The mountains are important because they aren't a defense: they are a weakness. Important rivals -- the Elamites (down to the Southeast above the Persian Gulf) , the Hittites (in modern Turkey) and the eventual conquerors of the region, the Persians from the northeast all lived in the mountains where they were difficult to conquer. The western route along the Euprhates (through modern Syria) offered multiple routes for attackers as well. For this reason Mesopotamia is a complex layer-cake of people and languages from all directions: The list of ethnic groups in Mesopotamia is too long to write here but to give you a sample there are Sumerians, Akkadians, Gutians, Kassites, Assyrians, Elamites, Mitanni, Hurriaans, and many smaller groups. By contrast, in Egypt there are... Egyptians. Egypt wasn't complete monolith but its was vastly less diverse and less subject to foreign conquests.

Not surprisingly, Egyptian civilization --- in a far less dangerous, more predictable and benign environment -- emphasized stability, order and the eternal order of the universe. Mesopotamian life was far more exposed to the whims of fate, and the Mesopotamians were both more fatalistic and more daring than their Egyptian contemporaries.
