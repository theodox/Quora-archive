Game dev has a lot of technical requirements - but ultimately it's a creative field like music or the arts. Like those it offers a very small chance of huge rewards -- and a lot of economic insecurity if you are not one of the lucky ones who get to work on a hit. 

There are two very distinct paths in modern development. 

 "Traditional" development in the big studio model pays pretty well and is comparatively stable -- if you can land a job with one of the big studios you can expect decent compensation and some measure of stability, although your chances of becoming really rich by working at Ubisoft, EA, Activision and the like are very small -- while most big companies do offer bonuses and stock options they are mature enough that explosive growth in their stock is not very likely. The salary numbers you see in things like the [Game Developer Salary Survey](http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2014/09/05/GAMA14_ACG_SalarySurvey_F.pdf) are pretty indicative of what you can expect in that route. Programmers make decent money in games -- but, relative to fields with less glamor, they actually make less than equally talented programmers elsewhere. I know more than a few game devs who've go on to careers in more mundane programming and made much more money: games are a very, very punishing form of programming, so if you're a good game programmer you're likely a very good programmer overall.

Big studios have a couple of drawbacks, though. The big one is that they've been shrinking as a share of the industry -- as new platforms and game genres fragment the simple old console market, "AAA" style big development is stagnating and big studios are consolidating around existing franchises. The remaining projects can be quite expensive ($50 million pretty cheap for a AAA game these days) and, for that reason, tend to be increasingly risk averse. Like hollywood movie studios, game studios have to play it safe when gambling with tens of millions of other people's dollars.

Indie development is a more small-scale and tends to be where all the creative risk taking happens. Individuals and small groups can now make technically accomplished games -- and, thanks to online distribution through things like Steam, Google Play and the App Store they can sell them directly to customers. This has produced a lot of the big innovations in game, often from small groups or even individuals.

Once in a great while this produces a breakout hit which makes everyone involved a lot of money (eg, _Minecraft_ ). Statistically, though, that's very rare: most indie developers make less money and have more economic worries than their big-studio counterparts (there was one recent survey which claimed the average indie developer made only $11,000 US -- less than a dishwasher. Many of the people in that survey, though, do game development as a side project). Indie developers have much more creative freedom but it comes with a lot of economic risk. For a good, clear eyed look at the pros and cons of the indie business I'd recommend Dan Cook's blog, particularly his invaluable [piece on "sustainable success"](http://www.lostgarden.com/). As an indie you're basically in business for yourself -- it's exciting and fulfilling, but not really a 'safe' career. 

In either case you probably do not get a lot of extra credit from a Master's. The industry is generally pretty un-impressed by academic credentials.

The other thing to keep in mind is that games is, if anything, even worse than the rest of the software business at issues of work-life balance. Although things are not as bad as they were in the days of the [EA spouse](http://ea-spouse.livejournal.com/274.html) controversy, game companies do expect commitment that goes beyond just 9-5 hours (this is usually even truer in indie development, where the teams are small and the stakes are high).
