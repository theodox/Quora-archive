This may be surprising to a lot of modern observers of Sparta, but the deities who got the most attention from Spartans were actually __[Artemis](http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Artemis.html)__ ____ and __[Apollo](http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Apollon.html)__ .

_Artemis (R) and Apollo (L) , from the archeological museum of Sparta._ 

The two biggest festivals of the Spartan year were the [Hyacinthia](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/secondary/smigra*/hyacinthia.html), dedicated to Apollo and the hero [Hyakinthos](http://www.theoi.com/Heros/Hyakinthos.html), and the [Carneia](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Carneia.html), dedicated to Apollo Carneos. The most important shrine in Sparta was the temple of [Artemis Orthia](http://www.civilization.org.uk/greece/greece-extra/sparta/the-shrine-of-artemis-orthia) — this was where Spartan boys were ritually whipped as part of their coming-of-age ceremony (a popular tourist attraction in later Greek times). At least one Spartan account said the the whippings were a replacement for an archaic human sacrifice, which gives a good idea of how seriously the Spartans regarded Artemis.

The other notable cult at Sparta — though appearing later — was the worship of __[Zeus Ammon](http://ancientheroespodcast.com/blog/alexander-the-great-zeus-ammon)__ , an aspect of Zeus connected to the oracle of the Egyptian god [Amun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amun) at Siwa in Libya. Sparta was one of the sponsors of the Greek colony at [Cyrene, Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrene,_Libya) which which adopted a Greekified version of the Egyptian god and the worship spread from there back to Sparta. There were two temples to Zeus Ammon — one in Sparta proper, and one in the Spartan seaport at Gytheum.

All that said, _some_  respect was shown for __Ares__ .

Ares in general wasn’t a popular god in the Greek world, even in Sparta. His name — which means “ruin” — and his mythological reputation as a braggart and a bully didn’t endear him to most Greeks; there’s a reason he was said to reside among the barbarous Thracians, also stereotyped as both violent and boastful. The Spartans, who prided themselves on their _eunomia_ , their well-ordered society, were suspicious of the ‘berserker’ ethos. Nonetheless, there was a [temple of Ares in Laconia](http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias3B.html). There was also a statue of [Enyalios](http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Enyalios.html) —either a nickname for Ares or his son — bound in chains:

> [there is ] an old image of Enyalius in fetters. The idea the Lacedaemonians express by this image is the same as the Athenians express by their Wingless Victory; the former think that Enyalius will never run away from them, being bound in the fetters, while the Athenians think that Victory, having no wings, will always remain where she is.

In historic times the Spartans would sacrifice to Ares _after_  a battle: an ox for victories or a rooster for defeats (it’s said that _before_  a battle, they sacrificed to the Muses — another surprising sidelight on their culture).

There is one scrap from an Athenian writer who claims that the Spartans offered human sacrifices to Ares — but there’s no reports of this in historic times and the writer is a collector of myths, not a historian, so the story is regarded as a dubious effort to explain an old legend rather than a regular practice.
