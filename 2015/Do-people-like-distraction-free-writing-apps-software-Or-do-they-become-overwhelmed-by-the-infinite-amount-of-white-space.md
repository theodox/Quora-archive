For me, at least, they've been a huge productivity booster. I write faster and I can't procrastinate by hiding behind formatting quibbles or worrying about the difference between straight and curly quotes. I do all of my writing in [Ulysses](http://www.ulyssesapp.com/) on the Mac or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) on PC, and nowadays I use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) when I need a little more structure than plain text. The combination of a clutter-free visual field, much snappier and more responsive apps makes me feel, at least, like I' m more productive.

The other part of the equation for me is that plain text is easy to version. I use [Github](https://github.com/) for work, and now that I'm comfortable with it i've found it is also an excellent way to maintain a version history of what I'm doing, complete with branches the ability to see past changes and even to try different branches of development. It is intended for programmers so it's not a quick pickup if you're not technical, but it's incredibly useful and there is a front end with a GUI and lots of tutorials floating around the net.

The last good thing: the very provisional look of an unformatted plain text page is a good thing, especially if you're a decent typist. Its a subliminal reminder that you can cut, paste, rearrange and delete -- it helps you get over the blank page problem by letting you scratch in a few quick notes and iterate, instead of feeling like everything you write needs to be as perfectly written as your beautiful fonts and careful punctation expect.
