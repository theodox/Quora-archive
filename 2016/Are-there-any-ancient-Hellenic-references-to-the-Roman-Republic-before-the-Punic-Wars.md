The earliest sources are all basically gone: they exist only in quotations or paraphrases in later authors. The earliest mentions come from the generation after Alexander, but there’s not much to go on until we hit the familiar sources like Polybius in the second century BC.

It’s said that [Antiochus of Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_of_Syracuse) wrote about Rome in his book on the colonization of Italy, as early as the 420’s BC. However we have no direct attributions for his information, if any, about Rome or Romans.

It’s possible that [Ephorus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephorus)discussed Roman matters, since he’s quoted by Strabo for some Italian geographical references. If that’s so he’d be the first known reference, since he was a contemporary of Alexander.

A little later [Hieronymus of Cardia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_of_Cardia) also touched on Roman matters; he was also a contemporary of Alexander but lived to be more than 100 so he recorded the Italian ventures of [Pyrrhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus), the first recorded instance of Greek-Roman conflict. Polybius uses Hieronymus’ numbers for casualties at the battles of Heraclea and Asuculum during that war.

The main early source is [Timaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(historian)) — not surprisingly, a Sicilian — who wrote a history around the beginning of the 3rd century BC. Like Hieronymus, he covered Pyrrhus (who also campaigned in Sicily) and the first Punic war which was fought on Sicilian soil. He’s used by more familiar writers like Diodorus Siculus and heavily criticized (though still used) by Polybius. He’s often credited with being the first Greek to recognize the importance of Rome.

The otherwise unknown [Diocles of Peparethus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocles_of_Peparethus)wrote a history of Rome around the beginning of the third century BC. His work (also lost) was used as a source by the earliest known Latin historian, [Quintus Fabius Pictor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Fabius_Pictor).

Shortly thereafter [Agathocles of Cyzicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agathocles_(writers)) also touched on early Roman history but again there’s not much left of his work, although it’s sometimes thought that he was not a Greek at all but a Babylonian (though if that were true, he’d be a citizen of Seleucid Babylon so he could still be a Hellene).

A good example of the spotty nature of the record is Pindar’s ode on the Syracusan victory over Carthage at Himera (battle 480 BC, poem about 10 years later). It includes a prayer that “the Etruscans and Carthagonians remain quiet at home.” When the poem was written Rome was had been an independent republic for a generation, but it clearly didn't rate a mention even from a writer conversant with Italian affairs.
