Greek-Carthaginian relations were actually pretty fraught.

Sicily (and to a lesser degree Sardinia and Corsica) were hotly contested between Greek and Carthaginian settlers. For more than three centuries there were on-again, off-again contests between the two cultures as they vied for control over the western Mediterraneam

_Greeks (red) and Carthaginians (yellow)… and waiting in the wings, the Romans (gray)_ 

Greek settlers started arriving in Sicily around the 7th century. Most of their initial conflicts were with the local Sicels. Carthage was actually much older (founded 814 BC or so), but at this period the Carthaginian economy was focused on the metals trade between Iberia and the Levant; the Carthaginians were not particularly interested in territorial expansion.

The rise of the Persian empire - which conquered the Phoenician homeland in the 530’s - disrupted the long-distance metal trade. The Phoenician colonies in the west reoriented around local trade and agriculture — which led to territorial expansion in Libya, Sicily and Sardinia… and to conflicts with the Greek settlements on those islands.

This led to a long series of wars, known collectively as the [Sicilian Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Wars). These lasted from the early 5th century down to the time of the second Punic War, and they were pretty nasty. The Sicilian Greeks were as fractious as their mainland cousins and frequently called in Carthaginian assistance in their internal struggles; the Carthaginian in turn fought the wars primarily with mercenary armies whose compensation was heavily oriented towards plunder. The combination of civil wars and organized pillage, overlaid on top of ethnic conflict, led to a lot of brutality in both directions, with cities like Carthaginian [Motya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motya) and Greek [Akragas ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Akragas_(406_BC))being thoroughly sacked.

Not surprisingly this led to pretty harsh stereotypes in Greek depictions of Carthaginians. Most of the negative judgements passed on the Carthaginians in the Roman era — faithlessness, greed, cruelty and cowardice — really originate in Greek literary traditions of earlier centuries. A good deal of the groundwork is visible in the works of Sicilian Greek historians like [Timaeus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(historian)) and [Diodorus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus), which are [consistently hostile](http://erenow.com/ancient/carthagemustbedestroyed/32.html) to the Carthaginians.

It also didn't help that the western Greeks hadn't contributed to the defeat of the Persian invasion of 480; in later years they put a lot of effort into portraying the Syracusan victory over Carthage at[ Himera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Himera_(480_BC)) as a bookend to the great Hellenic victory over “barbarism” at [Salamis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis). That propagandistic aspect culminated in the story — we don't know if it's historical— that the victorious Greeks forced the Carthaginians to forswear child sacrifice as part of the peace treaty (more on this [here](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Carthaginians-really-sacrifice-children-or-was-that-a-story-intended-to-slander-them-after-the-fact/answer/Steve-Theodore) ). Certainly most traditional descriptions of Carthaginian “barbarity” come from Greek writers who wanted to paint their rivals in a bad light.

It wasn’t always bad, however. For example, Aristotles’ [Constitution of the Carthaginians](http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/aristotle-carthage.asp) (written around 340 BC — and far from Sicily) is fairly positive: he regards the mixture of aristocratic and popular elements in the Carthaginian constitution as superior to many contemporary Greek ones — including that of Athens. The lost Greek historian [Philinus of Agrigentum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philinus_of_Agrigentum) was pro-Carthaginian (in the eyes of his fellow Greeks, anyway). And it's clear that a lot of Greek knowledge of the western Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts is second-hand, via Carthage.

There was also more trade and peaceful contact than this summary might imply. Carthage adopted many Greek cultural stylings, particularly in architecture and and pottery. It's obvious from the career of Hannibal that the Carthaginians knew the Greek cultural world well enough to play its politics skillfully and to admiration — during both the second and third Punic wars the Carthaginians found Greek allies , albeit rather ineffectual ones. Hannibal eventually ended up as prominent figure in Hellenistic courts, first as a military advisor to Seleucid emperor [Antiochus III ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_III_the_Great)and later with Prusias of Bithynia. Hannibal’s biography — now lost, alas — was written by his Greek tutor, Sosylus of Lacedaemon.
