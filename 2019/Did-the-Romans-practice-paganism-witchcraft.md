__Paganism?__ 

Yes, although sticking a single label on it gives a very false impression. There was a tremendous variety of beliefs, ranging from very abstract philosophy to pantheism to a very literalist belief in individual gods whose help had to be solicited by sacrificial offerings.

The primary unifying factor was the observance of public rituals: Roman society didn’t care much what you believed, but was intensely interested in making sure you participated publicly in the outward show of tradition.

“Pagan” comes from the Latin word _paganus, “countryman”_ . The conversion of the empire to Christianity began in the cities; rural areas were more traditional, so “countryman” became a synonym for “polytheist”

__Witchcraft?__ 

Yes again, but definitely not the kind you would find in your local Wiccan bookshop.

Romans were _extremely_ worried about witchcraft, which they regarded as an underworld activity: you can get the flavor from the fact that the common word for witchcraft in Latin_is_ _[veneficium](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/CP/27/2/Poisoning*.html)_ _—_  which means both “sorcery” and “poison”. The [Twelve Tables](https://www.constitution.org/sps/sps01_1.htm)— Rome’s oldest legal code — made harmful magic a capital crime, and the prohibition was reiterated in many ways down the centuries.

Despite the legal prohibitions, magical pursuits were a common part of Roman culture. Some kinds of magic, such as love-potions or healing spells, were generally tolerated. Love potions in particular were apparently very popular — they are a staple of Roman literature — but even there the shadow of the darker kinds of magic was never far away: For example Horace’s [Epode V](http://nonnumadanda.blogspot.com/2011/02/horace-epode-5.html) [translation at the bottom of the linked page] describes a witch ritually murdering a young boy to harvest his organs for love potions.
