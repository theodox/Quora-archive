# Why did the Ancient Greeks refer to Ancient Blacks (the Ethiopians) as 'blameless' and 'favored by the gods'? Also, what does it mean?

In one sense, it means exactly what it sounds like: there was an enduring positive stereotype about “Ethiops,” who were seen as dignified, pious and brave.

As for “blameless”: the word in Greek is ἀμύμων, _amimon,_  and it can be used as a reference to moral perfection or to physical perfection — “unblemished”, in old-fashioned English, would be a better translation than “blameless”*. Because of the ambiguity in Homer’s language, the stereotype could refer to either the physical or the moral perfection of the the Ethiopians; thus, subsequent Greek tradition tended to regard them as both handsome _and_  virtuous. Herodotus, for example, described the Ethiops as “the tallest and handsomest and longest-lived people.” (3.20).

The quotes from Diodorus in [Nick Nicholas](https://www.quora.com/profile/Nick-Nicholas-5)’ answer come from about 500 years after Herodotus (probably 800 years or more after Homer, whose date and individual existence are very much debated).. In the meantime, though, practical contact with sub-Saharan African remained fairly limited ([this unfortunately titled question](https://www.quora.com/Why-werent-black-people-discovered-before-the-Europeans-found-them-Please-read-details) covers some more of the sources over the years). So, the nice traditional picture rarely got complicated by much messy real-world detail. Although individual Africans showed up in the Greco-Roman world, first hand experience that ranged beyond the borders of Egypt or the shores of the Red Sea was very rare — well into the Roman period you’ll still find “authorities” recycling 500-year-old snippets of Herodotus rather than than adding much new detail about the world south of the Sahel.

It’s also frustrating for us because information about distant lands in the ancient world was very, very hard to come by. Long distance travel was expensive and dangerous — there was only a little overlap between the kind of people who actually went to see distant lands and the kinds of people who wrote books. So good information, philosophical imaginings, and travelers’ tall tales are often inextricably linked.

Here’s a case in point: Herodotus also says that the _[Macrobioi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrobians)_ , or “Long-lived-people” of what we’d call the Sudan usually lived to 120 or more. Is that an exaggeration of the well-known fact that hunter-gatherers often have longer life expectancies than dwellers in crowded cities before modern sanitation? Or is it a bit of Homer’s “blessings” in disguise? Herodotus also says this country has a ‘table of the sun’ — an open-air banquet at which any one can feast for free * — that might be a bit of authentic local custom or it might be a slightly secularized retelling of Homer’s divine feasts. And his Macrobioi chain their prisoners up with fetters of gold — is that a bit of fairy-tale grandeur? Or a realistic reflection of a culture which (like early Egypt) had plenty of gold and not much bronze or iron?

You do have to be sympathetic to the poor ancient writers, however: sometimes being skeptical was just as bad as being credulous. Old Herodotus also recounts the story of a 3-year expedition, sent by Egyptian Pharaoh [Necho II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necho_II), which circumnavigated Africa from Aden around to the Pillars of Hercules and back to Phoenicia. He then says, more or less, “but I know that’s impossible — the story says that the sailors had the sun on their right hand side when sailing west, which can’t be true” It’s impossible in the _northern_ hemisphere, all right — but absolutely correct in the southern one, which Herodotus never saw but the sailors did.

So — a lot of recycled stories, but how they fit together is an interesting puzzle. It’s worth remembering that the Greeks were not necessarily all of one mind about these kinds of things: In more recent times, European-Americans have produced wildly different images of Native Americans, ranging from bloodthirsty devil-worshippers to idealized noble savages to the Lost Tribes of Israel. Actual detailed factual information is much rarer than the vivid imagery. There’s no reason that the Greeks would be much more consistent or more reliable.



* [Aegisthus, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegisthus)a legendary sleazeball but a pretty boy, is described “unblemished” in this sense even though he could hardly be called “blameless”.
** Herodotus’ actual words aren’t clear: he seems at one point to say this ‘table of the sun’ is stocked by the local government, but in the next passage that “the earth itself” produces the bounty. It hardly matters : to a Greek audience (where protein was expensive and rare!) a non-magical public feast of meat would be almost a miracle anyway.
