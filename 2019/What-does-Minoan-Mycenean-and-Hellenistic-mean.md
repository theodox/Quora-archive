All of these are words used to describe different phases or epochs in the history of the eastern Mediterranean.

__Minoan__  refers to the distinctive civilization of Crete, which flourished from about 2700 to 1400 BC.

__Mycenaean__  refers to the Bronze Age civilization of Greece, roughly 1600 to 1100 BC.

Mycenaean and Minoan civilizations overlapped in time; they had both peaceful and military exchanges. Mycenaeans conquered Crete around 1400 BC.

__Hellenistic__  refers to the culture of the Greek speaking world after the conquests of Alexander the Great until the Roman era or even up to perhaps the second century AD.
