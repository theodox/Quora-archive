It goes back to the region of [Jáchymov, in what’s now the Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1chymov) but which used to bear the German name _Joachimsthal_ or “Saint Joachim’s Valley.”

In the 1500’s this area became famous for its high quality silver mines and the coins produced from them:

In those days the value of a coin was it’s metal content, not the implied backing of a government — so high quality coins with a lot of pure silver in them circulated very widely. It wasn’t uncommon for merchants to demand payment in the form of specific types of coins. The long name Joachimsthalers was soon shortened to _thalers,_ and it became synonymous with high-quality, trade-friendly coins.

When Spanish began minting the enormous silver resources of New World — which flooded the world market in the late 1500’s — they produced a coin which was intended for easy exchange with the thaler and the Dutch [daalder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaler#Dutch_daalder): it quickly got the common nickname _talero._ 

However, Spain’s internal currency (known as the _real)_ was much smaller. So the new _taleros_  were fixed to the value of 8 _reales_ —becoming the _[pieces of eight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_dollar)_ __ so beloved of pirates. The ‘$’ sign is actually a stylized ‘8’ for this reason.

_Raaawwkk!! Pieces of eight! This is how you make change in a weight-of-metal economy._ 

When the US broke away from England, the adoption of “dollar” as an alternative to the pound made sense on two levels: it symbolized the break with the mother country but also facilitated trade and finance, since the Dutch daalder and the Spanish talero were the widest-circulating currencies of the day.

Mexican _taleros_ continued to be the dominant international currency until the 19th century — the [Hong Kong dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_dollar) and the [Singapore dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straits_dollar) get their names from that, not from the US currency.
