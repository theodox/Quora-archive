Professionals use “motion-capture” equipment, which comes in a variety of forms. The most common one uses high-speed cameras and “ball suits” which help the cameras track the positions of your limbs:

There are alternatives which don’t use suits, and also others which use magnetic or mechanical measurements to capture poses. The latter tech tends to be less precise but more flexible, since you don’t need a large clear space to capture the moves.

It’s also possible to do a limited kind of motion capture using the [Kinect camera on an Xbox One](https://www.reallusion.com/iclone/mocap/) or similar depth-sensing cameras. This is a popular option for hobbyists and researchers on a budget.
