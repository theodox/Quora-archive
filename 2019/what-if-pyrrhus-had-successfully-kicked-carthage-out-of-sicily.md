Probably little would change. Pyrrhus is the poster child for Hellenistic ADHD. He never seemed stay focused on any task longer than a few months; his bravery, his leadership qualities on the battlefield, and his charisma all went for nought thanks to his short attention span and lack of patience. [Plutarch summed it up like this](http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/pyrrhus.html):

> [Pyrrhus] was held, for military experience, and personal valour and enterprise, much the bravest of all the princes of his time, only what he got by great actions he lost again by vain hopes, and by new desires of what he had not, kept nothing of what he had. So that Antigonus used to compare him to a player with dice, who had excellent throws, but knew not how to use them.

Consider this resume:

__280 BC__  - arrives in Italy to “rescue” the Italiot Greeks from Rome; wins battle of Heraclea

__279__  - Fought to a draw at Asculum; leaves Italy (abandoning the Italiots) and goes to Syracuse to fight the Carthaginians

__278–277__  - Campaigns successfully in Sicily.

__276__  - Besieges last Carthaginian foothold in Sicily, but fails to take it after two month’s siege. Tries to impose military conscription and heavy taxes on Greek Sicily, which goes over to Carthage. Returns to Italy to save Tarentum, the last Greek city holding out against the Romans.

__275__ . Abandons Italy after another drawn battle with the Romans; returns to Epirus.

__274__  Attacks Macedonia, talks the Macedonian army into switching sides with almost no fighting and becomes king of most of Macedon.

__272__  While still at war with the previous king of Macedon, takes his army to Sparta on behalf on an unpopular junior member of the Spartan royal family. After failing to take Sparta, he attacks Argos instead. He’s killed in street fighting in Argos.

If you weren’t counting, that six wars (all voluntary) against six different opponents in eight years. It’s a tribute to Pyrrhus’s enterprise and energy but not to his judgement: he never managed to consolidate any of his considerable gains before running off half-cocked to a new adventure. If he had completely driven the Carthaginians out he might have moved on to Spain, or headed for Africa, or done something else equally improbable. There’s nothing in his other doings, however, to suggest he would have taken a deep breath and built anything enduring. The only way in which Pyrrhus bested Alexander — his cousin and his role model — was in the sudden evaporation of his empire.
