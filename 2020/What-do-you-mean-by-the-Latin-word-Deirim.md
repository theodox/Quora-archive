It does not show up in any Latin dictionary I can find. The closest Latin I can see is _deirem,_ with a -em, which is “I may go down”, the subjunctive form of deeo (which is a pretty rare word).

_Dein_ is an adverb meaning “in order” or “in place”,

Otherwise I’d suspect an OCR error in a a scanned text — or a scribal mistake.
