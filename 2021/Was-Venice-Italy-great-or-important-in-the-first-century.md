Not in the first century. Venice only became important in the wake of the Lombard invasion, when it was settled by Roman refugees seeking a more defensible location. It’s the only major Italian city without an obvious Roman antecedent.

Traditionally the Venetians claimed to be refugees from [Aquileia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquileia), about a hundred and fifty kilometers to the east. Late-imperial Aquileia was a big, important city — a sometime imperial capital with a population of more than a hundred thousand, in the “top ten” category in the Roman empire. It was also one of the gateways to Italy so it faced attacks from a series of invaders, most notably Attila the Hun who nearly levelled it in 452. The Lombards hit the revived city again in 568 and then 590.

Venice, located in the murky lagoons and hard to attack from land, became a place of refuge for the Roman populace. It was also a toehold for the emperors in Constantinople, who battled the Lombards to retain a tenuous hold on northern Italy after the collapse of the western empire although the Byzantine capital of Italy was Ravenna, not Venice. There seem to have been people living in the marshes and islands from 420s on, but the first record of an organized city government is from 568.
