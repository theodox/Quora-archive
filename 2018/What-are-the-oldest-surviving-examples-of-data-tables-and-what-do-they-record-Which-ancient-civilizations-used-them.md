This is not just the world’s first spreadsheet - it’s also believed to be oldest sample of writing on paper (well, on papyrus), dated to about 2500 BC.

It’s part of the diary of an official named Merer, who was inspecting Pharaoh [Khufu’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu)s naval station at [Wadi al-Jarf](https://www.academia.edu/6248978/THE_HARBOR_OF_KHUFU_on_the_Red_Sea_Coast_at_Wadi_al-Jarf_Egypt_NEA_77_1_) on the Red Sea. The diary records day-by-day activities for Merer’s tour of duty. [Here’s a sample](http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2017/09/27/the-log-book-of-inspector-merer-from-wadi-al-jarf-and-the-pyramid-of-cheops-khufu/) (link includes sources):

> [First day ] the director of 6 Idjer[u] casts of for Heliopolis in a transport boat-iuat to bring us food from Heliopolis while the Elite (stp-sȝ) is in Tura.
Day 2: Inspector Merer spends the day with his phyle hauling stones in Tura North; spends the night at Tura North.
Day 3: Inspector Merer casts off from Tura North, sails towards Akhet-Khufu loaded with stone.
[Day 4 …] the director of 6 [Idjer]u [comes back] from Heliopolis with 40 sacks-khar and a large measure-heqat of bread-beset while the Elite hauls stones in Tura North.
Day 5: Inspector Merer spends the day with his phyle loading stones onto the boats-hau of the Elite in Tura North, spends the night at Tura.
Day 6: Inspector Merer sets sail with a boat of the naval section (gs-dpt) of Ta-ur, going downriver towards Akhet-Khufu. Spends the night at Ro-She Khufu.

The Egyptians were very meticulous in their tabular data — here’s an example carved into the walls of the temple at Karnak (about a millennium later than the papyrus above).

Which brings up a useful point: __recordkeeping precedes literature.__ The earliest examples of proto-writing in Mesopotamia, almost a thousand years before Merrer’s diary, are always just lists of stuff. For example this tablet:

Is basically a receipt: It says “29086 measures of barley - 37 months - Kushim”. Kushim [may be the oldest recorded personal name](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-the-first-real-person-in-history-whose-name-we-know-for-certain-not-Adam-and-Eve-or-Noah-and-so-on-but-a-historical-figure-who-undoubtedly-existed/answer/Steve-Theodore), although it could be a title; we don’t know for sure. Here’s a form of data table that didn’t last long:

The cones and wedges represent, respectively, measures of grain and groups of livestock. They’d be impressed into the clay ball as a form of double-entry book keeping: not only did the tokens provide a record of what was being tracked, removing them from the clay “envelope” left a mark which indicated a change: effectively, the world’s oldest edit log.

This kind of accounting data — lists of things, delivery dates, and receipts — dominates the early history of writing in Mesopotamia, Egypt and Greece. It probably reflects that fact that the Bronze age economies were surprisingly centralized (much more so than their Iron Age successors) — obsessive accounting was a prominent feature of what’s known as the [Palace economy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_economy) The absence of currency (not to be invented for more than 2,000 years after Kushim received his barley) meant it was critical to track individual consignments of commodities in kind.
