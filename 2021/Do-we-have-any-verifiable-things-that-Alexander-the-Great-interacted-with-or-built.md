You can’t see it any more — but, with ground penetrating radar (or a building permit from the local authorities) you could still find one construction which Alexander personally oversaw.

When [Alexander besieged the Phoenician city of Tyre in 332 BC](https://www.livius.org/articles/battle/tyre-332-bce/), it was an island. Since Tyre formed the key base of the Persian fleet which could threaten his communications with Greece, Alexander was determined to take it before heading inland to confront the Great King in Mesopotamia. So, he had his engineers build a gigantic mole from the shore to allow his infantry to attack the city — eventually the construction would be about a kilometer long and 60 meters wide. Alexander supervised the construction as it inched toward the city through a hail of attacks from missiles and fire-ships.

Alexander’s mole didn’t quite reach the city walls: by the time it was close enough for his artillerists to mount catapults on its leading edge to harass the city, naval reinforcements allowed him to take the town by forcing an entry into its northern harbor.

Nonetheless the mole remained, and over the centuries it accumulated more and more sediment from the ocean currents. Today it forms the spine of a sandy peninsula, half a kilometer wide, which connects the former island of Tyre to the mainland.

Portions of the mole were still visible as recently as the 19th century, but today it lies hidden under the the modern city of Tyre, probably just a bit south of today’s Hyram street. It would be fairly easy for a professional archaeologist to find, since Alexander’s engineers used the ruins of the older coastal city of Tyre (destroyed by the Babylonians in 573) as the main construction material. However the area is now pretty populous, so a large scale exploration is not likely anytime soon. Nonetheless it’s the most tangible and indisputable first-hand relic of Alexander’s reign.

On a humbler scale, there’s one surviving contemporary inscription which Alexander might have commissioned himself:

The [Priene Inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priene_Inscription ) records Alexander’s restoration of the temple of Athena Polias in Priene, which his funded sometime after his initial victory at the Granicus in 334 BC. Unfortunately there’s no easy way to know if this inscription was done while Alexander and his army were still in the neighborhood or not. Given the fact that there were still Persian armies active in the field, it’s not too likely Alexander hung around to cut the ribbon on the restored temple.



Some art historians believe that the [Lion Stone of Hamadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamadan_Stone_Lion#:~:text=The%20stone%20lion%20of%20Hamadan,said%20to%20have%20been%20located.) is part of the memorial which Alexander built for his companion Hephaestion — but that’s conjectural. If so, it’s likely that he oversaw its completion.

You’ll occasionally find references online to Alexander’s sarcophagus. However the item in question — which resides in the British museum — became readable in the 19th century when hieroglyphics were discovered, and it turns out to have been the last resting place of Nectanebo II, the last native Egyptian pharaoh. According to the highly dubious _Alexander Romance,_ Nectanebo was a magician who transformed himself into a dragon and flew to Macedonia to impregnate Alexander’s mother — so maybe this should earn half points.



As for personal items, there aren’t any unless you want to count the numerous coins which bear Alexander’s likeness as “personal.”

Alexander’s armor and weapons were preserved in Alexandria, where he was buried ([after his body was “kidnapped” on it’s way back to Macedonia from Babylon](https://sbhistorygeek.wordpress.com/2013/01/12/the-man-who-stole-a-god/)) . Roman emperors visited the tomb: [Augustus accidentally snapped off Alexander’s nose](https://histastrophe.com/2018/03/14/the-nose-goes-when-octavian-meets-alexander-the-great/), for example. Some of the crazier ones indulged in a little grave-robbing: Caligula stole Alexander’s breastplate and Caracalla, [(who liked to pose as Alexander reincarnated](https://alexandrei0n.wordpress.com/2018/12/20/caracalla-the-roman-emperor-who-believed-himself-the-reincarnation-of-alexander-the-great/)) returned a few items stolen by his predecessors. But Alexander’s tomb was lost to memory sometime before 400 (either in the widescale destruction of Alexandria in 270 during the war with Palmyra, or in the tsunami of 365 which laid waste to the whole royal quarter of the city) so none of his personal items are known to have survived.
