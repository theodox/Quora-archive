Yes, although they can’t claim to have invented the idea. Roman city planning was generally based around the layout of the traditional Roman military camp, which was typically laid out like this:

Many Roman cities were designed for the strategic resettlement of military veterans — they did double duty for economic development and as strategic strongpoints in conquered areas. So it was a pretty natural move to adopt the military layout for urban planning as well. That’s why it’s often easy to spot the old Roman core of many cities in aerial photos;

When terrain was favorable the plan was often intensely regular:

However the Romans also had to accommodate the pre-existing environment, both natural and human. Plenty of Roman settlements had to adapt to the terrain or to the realities of a pre-Roman city layout. The most famous example is, of course, Rome itself — which began as disconnected set of settlements atop steep hills arranged around a curved riverfront and swamp. The most Roman of all Roman spaces, the forum, was gradually reclaimed from the tricky terrain over the course of several centuries.
