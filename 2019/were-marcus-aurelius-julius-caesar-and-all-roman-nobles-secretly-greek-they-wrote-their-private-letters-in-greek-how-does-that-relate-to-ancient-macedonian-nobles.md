It’s very common for aristocrats to use a “prestige” language with each other that’s not the language of their poorer neighbors. You don’t need to go all the way back to antiquity: whether it’s Tolstoy characters talking French to each other, Japanese nobles swapping Chinese poems, or wealthy Nigerians sporting polished Oxford accents, there are plenty of examples of the phenomenon down the centuries.

Most of the Roman nobility had Greek tutors. Many of them went to Athens or Rhodes to study rhetoric or dabble in philosophy before they took up their adult careers in politics and the military. A Greek education in 1st century Rome was rather like a Latin education in 18th century London: the mark of a gentleman, and thus also an opportunity for social display. Romans who prided themselves on their cultural credentials would litter their correspondence with Greek the way Samuel Johnson dropped Latin mottoes into his: it was a mark of distinction.

This does put a useful bracket around the endless dreary arguments about the “Greekness” of the Macedonian elites. The dynamics of language prestige mean we have a hard time knowing for sure whether Alexander was Greek like Plato, or “Greek” like Marcus Aurelius — which is good reason for caution when people start to lose their temper over that one in either direction.
