As always, we don't know "the truth" because our sources are partial, fragmentary and contradictory. Here's what we have:

The [Life of Antony](http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/antony.html) by [Plutarch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch), written about 100 years after the events, is the primary source that Shakespeare relied on. Plutarch is very skillful at sketching vivid personalities and dramatic situations, so he was a natural favorite for later retellers -- particularly dramatists.

[Cassius Dio](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html) a Greek writer from about two centuries after the death of Cleopatra, wrote a political history which is one of the core sources for our knowledge of this time.'

Some aspects of the earlier story, particularly Caesar's part in it, are recorded in Caesars own (ghost-written) book on the Civil War between Caesar and Pompey; many fragments of the war between Octavian and Antony survive in the poetry of Horace and Suetonius. There is archaeological evidence, like this coin with Antony on one side and Cleopatra on the other:

and inscriptions put up by Octavian long after the fact to commemorate his victory. 

Of course, as [Assaph Mehr](https://www.quora.com/profile/Assaph-Mehr) points out this doesn't really cover the heart of the story. The play is drama, not history: Shakespeare's characters were based on what he read (itself incomplete and contradictory) but were invented characters who bore the names of historic personages.

[This article ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/cleopatra/rixens.html)has a good look at the sourcing of some of the common imagery in the story. [This one ](http://www.britaininprint.net/shakespeare/study_tools/sources_antony.html)discusses some of the factors influencing Shakespeare's sources and the translations he had available.
