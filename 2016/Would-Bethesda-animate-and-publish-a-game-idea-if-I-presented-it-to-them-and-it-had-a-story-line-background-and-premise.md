They would almost certainly return your envelope unopened or your email unread, probably with a note about company policy. 

 Most media companies - games, movies, tv and music - have to do this as a matter of course: without a policy like that they will receive hundreds or thousands of unsolicited pitches every year -- and pitches like that, without the accompanying legal framework of non-disclosure agreements and so on -- are legally very dangerous.

If you can prove that a company _did_  read your submission, the company has to worry that any future product they make which bears a passing resemblance to your pitch could land them in court. For that matter they also have to worry that you might sue them for giving your idea away to a third party, say a publisher or sister-studio that makes a game resembling your pitch.

Even though it's actually pretty hard to prove that a company has 'stolen' your idea -- the games business, after all, is not always famous for innovated, unprecedented stories and premises -- _proving_  in court that the idea not stolen is expensive and time consuming. So most companies take great pains to make sure that they do not even see unsolicited pitches. 

If you look carefully at the legalese on various company websites and forums you'll see that they are full of language to discourage open submissions of ideas... and, usually, asserting ownership of any IP that is proposed in violation of their rules.

If you have a pitch to make, you need to contact a business development rep, sign mutual non-disclosure agreements, and do your pitch in a formal setting. You will still find that's a tough sell: game pitches -- even good ones -- are everywhere. However this is the only road which will end up as a published game, unless you start your own studio.
