We don’t have any evidence for written Persian before the Persian conquest of Mesopotamia, and not many examples of Persian writing of any kind. Our main source are inscriptions — like the [Behistun Inscription](http://www.livius.org/articles/place/behistun/) — that are written in cuneiform characters .The Persians invented a variety of cuneiform to write their language for formal occasions, but it didn’t really catch on — they didn’t try very hard to impose it on their subjects and they didn’t even use it that much themselves. It’s not clear how literate the Persian ruling class actually was.

So, the Persian administration remained multilingual; Persians depended on literate locals to administer their empire and they did so in whatever languages were current in a given province. One of our (very few) sources for Persian administration is the [Persepolis Administrative Archives,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis_Administrative_Archives#Elamite_records) which contain documents in Greek, Akkadian, Elamite, and Phrygian as well as Persian. Since Mesopotamia was the most densely populated and wealthiest part of the empire, its writing and languages (Akkadian, and later Aramaic) were the most common but far from the only ones in circulation.

Still, there’s no question who was in charge. The Persian empire was a big, multicultural mix of peoples and cultures, but the top ranks were Persian. Their secretaries and ministers came from all over, but the top ranks were solidly Achaemenid (the satraps or governors had a “Persian council” as well as local advisors). This is a bit from the [Daiva inscription](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/achaemenid-royal-inscriptions/xph/) in Pasagardae which gives the flavor of a lot of others:

> . I am Xerxes, the great king, king of kings, king of countries containing many kinds of men, king in this great earth far and wide, son of king Darius, an [Achaemenian](http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/achaemenians.html), a Persian, son of a Persian, an [Aryan](http://www.livius.org/arl-arz/aryans/aryans.html)_,_  of Aryan stock.
