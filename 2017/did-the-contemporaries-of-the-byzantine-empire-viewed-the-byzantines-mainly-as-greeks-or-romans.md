The “Byzantines” retained the name of Romans at home right up until the 19th century.

The usage of “Romans” in the west hung on until around the time of the [Fourth Crusade](http://www.historynet.com/fourth-crusade.htm), when the long simmering disagreements between Orthodox and Catholic churches were combined with open warfare between the Byzantines and the the Crusaders. “Greeks” and “Latins” had already been the labels for the opposing theological parties, based not on ethnicity but on the language of liturgy. Combined with the political conflict the older usage of “Romans” was discarded generally abandoned by westerners after the Fourth Crusade, when there were “Latins” ruling over much of the former Byzantine territories. The Greeks still call this period the __Λατινοκρατία,__ “the rule of the Latins” while the Crusaders and Venetians generally made __Latini__ ______ a separate legal class in their domains.

You can see the dynamic emerging in the career of [Liutprand of Cremona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liutprand_of_Cremona), an ambassador from the German Holy Roman Emperor to to Byzantine emperor [Nikephoros II Phokas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikephoros_II_Phokas) in 968 or thereabouts. Part of Liutprand’s unique approach to diplomacy to was to go out of his way to call Nikephoros “Emperor of the Greeks”, which was intended (and received) as a deliberate affront. However he could also use the older form insultingly as well:

> "History tells us that Romulus, from whom the Romans get their name, was a fratricide born in adultery. He made a place of refuge for himself and received into it insolvent debtors, runaway slaves, murderers and men who deserved death for their crimes. This was the sort of crowd whom he enrolled as citizens and gave them the name of Romans. From this nobility are descended those men whom you style 'rulers of the world.' But we Lombards, Saxons, Franks, Lotharingians, Bavarians, Swabians and Burgundians, so despise these fellows that when we are angry with an enemy we can find nothing more insulting to say than -'You Roman!' For us in the word Roman is comprehended every form of lowness, timidity, avarice, luxury, falsehood and vice.

However the older usage was never forgotten, and could be revived whenever the diplomatic needs of the moment made it convenient. You can see, however, that it wasn’t forgotten in [this medal, made in Florence to commemorate the visit of emperor John VIII Palaiologos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_John_VIII_Palaeologus) to the [Council of Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Florence) in 1439:
