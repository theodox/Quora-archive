While this is highly hypothetical, I’d probably put more money on Shaka (assuming we control for things like age, terrain, etc).

The Spartan fighting style was ultimately driven by the aspis, the big heavy round Greek shield. A Greek infantryman was trained to stick close to his comrades — that way, the big round shield on your left arm covered half of your body but also provided cover to the man on your left. The heavy ash spear, the doru, was designed to thrust over the enemy’s shield — that’s one of the reasons traditional Greek armor included an uncomfortable full-face helmet: that big bronze spearhead might be coming right at your face. Greek battles resembled something like a giant rugby scrum, with the two tightly packed formations literally shoving each other up and down the battlefield until one broke. It was a style of fighting that emphasized discipline and endurance — but not dueling skills. It’s probably worth mentioning that Roman gladiator shows didn’t feature this style of equipment and fighting; it was simply not optimized for solo combat.

A Zulu warrior, on the other hand, was armed and equipped in a way that would allow for a lot more maneuverability and flexibility. There is some overlap — the Zulus were ultimately close-order infantry armed with spears. However, they didn’t have the same reliance on their neighbors (Zulu shields were taller and narrower than their Greek counterparts) and had to adopt a more kinetic fighting style. In particular, they learned to hook their own shields onto the rim on an enemy’s shield, pulling it aside to make way for a killing thrust with the ilkwa, a stabbing spear. That tactic would be a particularly unsettling one for a Greek warrior, accustomed to fighting from behind a shield wall. Lastly, the famous ability of Zulu impis to cover long distances at a run suggests that the Shaka might start with an advantage in pure stamina: the Spartans were of course famous for their high level of readiness, but no Spartan army ever covered fifty miles on foot in a single day.

The matchup is not a complete slam dunk. The Spartan doru spear would be longer (at 6–8 feet) than Shaka’s Zulu ilkwa (only about 3–4); it might be hard for Shaka to get close enough to hook Leonidas’ shield with his own. Shaka would probably carry one or two assegai (throwing javelins) as well. The Greek shield (being bronze faced wood) is tougher than the Zulu-equivalent made of hide; it might render those javelins mostly useless (the Spartan spear was not designed to be thrown). Leonidas’ metal armor and helmet would be an advantage, perhaps a significant one — though it would of course also take a toll on his stamina.

In a pitched battle between similar numbers, the Spartans would get more advantage from their weapons and equipment which were designed for tight formation fighting. In solo combat, though, I’d suspect that greater maneuverability and the habit of fighting one-on-one would probably give an edge to Shaka.
