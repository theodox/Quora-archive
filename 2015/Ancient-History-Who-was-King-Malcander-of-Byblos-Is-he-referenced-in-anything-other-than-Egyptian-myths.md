This is probably the source of the account:



> [15](http://...) [1](http://...) Thereafter Isis, as they relate, learned [357](http://...)that the chest had been cast up by the sea near the land of Byblus __[81](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html#note81)__  and that the waves had gently set it down in the midst of a clump of heather. The heather in a short time ran up into a very beautiful and massive stock, and enfolded and embraced the chest with its growth and concealed it within its trunk. The king of the country admired the great size of the plant, and cut off the portion that enfolded the chest (which was now hidden from sight), and used it as a pillar to support the roof of his house. These facts, they say, Isis ascertained by the divine inspiration of Rumour, and came to Byblus and sat down by a spring, all dejection and tears;__[82](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html#note82)__  she exchanged no word with anybody, save only that she welcomed the queen's maidservants and treated them with great amiability, plaiting their hair for them [B](http://...)and imparting to their persons a wondrous fragrance from her own body. But when the queen observed her maidservants, a longing came upon her for the unknown woman and for such hairdressing and for a body fragrant with ambrosia. Thus it happened that Isis was sent for and became so intimate with the queen that the queen made her the nurse of her baby. They say that the king's name was Malcander; the queen's name some say was Astartê, others Saosis, and still others Nemanûs, which the Greeks would call Athenaïs.



It's from [Plutarch's Isis and Osiris](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/home.html), which is a pretty late Greek interpretation of Egyptian stories (Plutarch wrote in the the first century AD, so about 400 years after Alexander's conquest of Egypt).
 
[Byblos](http://www.ancient.eu/Byblos/) was a historical city -- in modern Lebanon -- which was the most important cultural center in historical Phoenicia. Byblos traded heavily with Egypt (our 'bible' comes from _biblia:_ the Egyptian papyrus leaves the Phoenicians traded around the Mediterranean) and there seems to have been a lot of cultural exchange between Byblos and Egypt. In particular there was a lot of religious syncretism -- the second volume of The [Golden Bough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Bough) was "Attis, Adonis, Osiris", claiming that the theme of the dying-and-reviving god was a common thread of Greek, Phoenician and Egyptian mythology largely on the basis of crossovers like this story.

Malcander is possibly a Greekified version of the Phoenician deity _[Melqart](http://Melqart)_  -- but that's a bit suspect since (a) Melqart's cult was centered in Tyre, rather than Byblos and (b) most Greek writers automatically equated Melqart with Hercules and referred to him as such . So, it's possibly that the name is a historical personal name with the same Phoenician root word (_MLK,_ that is , 'king or lord' -- you see it in biblical names like 'Abimelech') but its more likely that reflects a Byblian religious tradition. Many cities in the near east celebrated and annual ritual marriage between the city's ruler and a surrogate for a fertility goddess, so "Malcander" could just be "the King" and his wife "Astarte" a priestess. However there's not enough evidence to be sure. 

In any event the name is a Greek version of a Phoenician name, so it's not likely to show up in other Egyptian stories unless they stem from a late period.
