# Is it true that the main sources for what we know about Achaemenid Empire and it's history is from Greek accounts and quotations rather then from Persian literature of the time which was basically absent?

There are vanishingly few first hand Persian sources from the Achaemenid era, for reasons laid out here:



There’s an almost complete roundup of the survivals here:



Most of these are pretty short, formulaic official inscriptions; the most interesting and important, by far, is the [Behistun inscription of Darius I](http://www.avesta.org/op/op.htm#db1) which is his official autobiography (aptly summarized [here](https://www.quora.com/Could-you-summarize-the-Behistun-inscription/answer/Luka-Trkanjec), for the irreverent).

We also have one cache of administrative documents:



These are overwhelmingly in Elamite rather than Persian; most of them are just receipts .

We have two sets of personal letters, both in Aramaic rather than Persian — both concern notable historical persons. The Aršama letters are a mix of private and personal business for the satrap of Egypt:



and the Bessus letters are precisely datable to the end of 330 BC; they show logistic efforts by [Bessus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessus), the Persian who murdered Darius III and briefly ruled as Artaxerxes V before being turned over to Alexander by his own officers.



There is the Avestan religious tradition, which is much older than the Achaemenid era. It seems to have been mostly oral in the Achaemenid period, and uses language which was already very archaic to Achaemenid ears. The surviving texts, however, were committed to writing in the Sassanid era, so several hundred years after the fact. A few Sassanian-era Zoroastrian texts talk about the era of Alexander in retrospect.
