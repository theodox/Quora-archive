The earliest ones are all lost or exist only in paraphrases and quotations by later authors. There’s some disagreement as to whether the earliest mention is likely to belong to [Antiochus of Syracuse ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_of_Syracuse)(writing around 420 BC) or [Ephorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephorus) (around 330 BC). Both touched on matters in the region, but neither has left a complete quote that mentions Rome.

[Hieronymus of Cardia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_of_Cardia) (a very long lived historian who was a contemporary of Alexander the Great but lived to the age of 104) chronicled the career of Pyrrhus of Epirus who fought the Romans in 280 BC, so he’d be the earliest unambiguous mention. [Timaeus of Tauromenion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(historian)) covered the same war, writing slightly later, and he recognized the fact that Rome was a rising power to be taken note of.
