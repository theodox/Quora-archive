There were plenty of polities in Europe between, say, 400 BC and the height of Roman; but few of them had the necessary skills and institutions to compete with the Romans or their main rivals: the Carthaginians in the west and the Macedonians in the east.

__Population__ 

 Most of Europe was dominated by the big, amorphous group of peoples we today call Celts or Gauls. From about the same time as Rome was founded these people spread outward in all directions from a central European homeland* to end up as far apart as England and Turkey.

This dying Gaul, with his mustache, broadsword and golden torc (and if contemporary descriptions are correct, red hair) comes from Pergamon, in modern Turkey; but his relatives ended up in Ireland with many of the same cultural and linguistic identifiers. Compare the torc around his neck with this one, from Norfolk, England:

These Celts or Gauls (we don't know what they called themselves: we have a host of tribal names but no idea if they had a national word for themselves)did not expand like a single, unified conquering force: they spread outward in many small, competing groups.

They reached the British Isles only two or three hundred years after the emergence of their distinctive culture in the 8th century BC: that's much quicker than the Romans, who didn't even penetrate deeply into modern France for another five centuries. The was possible because the population density outside the Mediterranean basin was much lower. It would not be until the middle ages that the France or England would be as densely populated as Italy.

The Gallo-Celtic lifestyle was rural, rather than urban. Cattle rearing was more important than settled farming (though they did farm, too) and populations moved around a lot: another feature of a lighter population, and a difficult basis to build empires on.

__Economics__ 

 In Italy, Greece and North Africa the big powers were parts of a flourishing maritime trade network carrying goods, people and ideas. A few hundred miles from the coast, however, trade and interchange slowed to a crawl: without roads or the security afforded by big, centralized states most of western Europe was living much closer to subsistence. The isolation was not complete: you can see occasional evidence of Mediterranean artifacts sprinkled across northern Europe. But contact was sporadic and life in the Gallo-Celtic lands remained mostly focused on cattle and small-scale warfare, a pattern that would still be familiar in medieval Ireland long after Rome had fallen.

_A Gallic oppidum, or township. Around the time this image is set, the city of Rome probably had a population of over 200,000._ 

Without trade the peoples of the interior never developed the kind of logistical skills needed to really create an empire. They could be a ferocious force: A Gallic army sacked Rome in 390 BC, the only foreign force to do so for 800 years. But they could not plan and sustain campaigns of conquest -- they were raiders, rather than colonizers. 

__Politics__ 

The Gallo-Celtic world was incredibly fragmented into a dizzying variety of tribes and peoples: Caesar's list of tribes in Gaul proper runs into the scores. These groups were usually enmeshed in a complex web of local rivalries which made it very hard for them to form stable, large political units. They had an aristocratic ruling class but don't seem to have had strong hereditary monarchies. This kept them in a constant state of political churn: Caesar was able to conquer France with only about 60,000 legionaries (and another 60,000 helpful locals!) by exploiting local rivalries and supporting different factions against each other. Similar political fragmentation was common in places where Gallic peoples held sway, such as Spain, England and the northern Balkans.

__TLDR__ :

What Rome, Carthage and Macedon had in common was the ability to coordinate their political and military ambitions over big spaces. The rest of Europe -- which in this period really means the Gauls -- was too immature to do that, having neither the political or economic foundations on which to build an empire. 

In the late second century BC, trade flowing up into Gaul through the Greek city of [Massilia](http://www.ancient.eu/massilia/), modern Marseille, did begin to transform Gaulish society. The valuable trade routes (and fights to control them) led to something more like city-states up and down the Rhone valley, with permanent political institutions and more developed economies. Given a few more generations a serious rival to Rome might have arisen: however, unfortunately for the Gauls, Julius Caesar got there first.



* the usual name for this group is the Hallstadt Culture, after archaeological finds in Hallstadt, Austria. That was not, however, a political capital as far as we know-- it's just an early find of characteristic artifacts.
