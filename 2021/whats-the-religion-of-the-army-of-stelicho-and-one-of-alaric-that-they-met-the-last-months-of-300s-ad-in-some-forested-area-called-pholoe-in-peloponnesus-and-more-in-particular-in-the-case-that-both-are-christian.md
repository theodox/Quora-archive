# What's the religion of the army of Stelicho and one of Alaric, that they met the last months of 300s AD,in some forested area called Pholoe in Peloponnesus? And more in particular, in the case that both are Christian, were they of same Christology?

__Stilicho was at least nominally orthodox__ : he was a trusted ally of Theodosius I, he married the emperor’s niece, and was appointed guardian to Honorius — all unlikely if he was an outspoken Arian. Traditionally he’s said to have been buried in the cathedral of St. Ambrose in Milan — though many scholars doubt that the sarcophagus shown there is really his, Ambrose did endorse Stilicho’s guardianship of Honorius in his funeral oration for Theodosius.

On the other hand Stilicho was broad-minded enough to be on good terms with the ultraconservative pagan [Symmachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Aurelius_Symmachus) and to employ the stuffy old-fashioned pagan poet [Claudian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudian). This in turn earned him a posthumous denunciation by [Orosius ,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orosius) who claimed (implausibly) that Stilicho’s son Eucherius was plotting to usurp the empire in order to restore paganism.*

__Alaric was an Arian Christian__  (Orosius calls him “Alaric, a hostile but a Christian king”). During the sack he made notable, if only moderately effective, efforts to spare the city’s churches. We can only speculate, though, about the depth of his religious leanings — he didn’t spend much time as a lawgiver or a civilian administrator. The man he chose to be his puppet-emperor in opposition to Honorius, [Priscus Attalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priscus_Attalus), was a pagan; but as part of his elevation to the throne Alaric had him baptized by an Arian bishop. Alaric died the year after the sack of Rome, and was buried with in a [manner straight out of a Viking saga](https://medium.com/the-mystery-box/lost-treasure-alarics-looted-treasures-of-rome-2a0bebddddc3):

> His people mourned for him with the utmost affection. Then turning from its course the river Busentus near the city of Cosentia, for this stream flows with its wholesome waters from the foot of a mountain near that city, they led a band of captives into the midst of its bed to dig out a place for his grave. In the depths of this pit, they buried Alaric, together with many treasures, and then turned the waters back into their channel. And that none might ever know the place, they put to death all the diggers.



It’s important to be leery of labels in the late fourth and early fifth century. Christian and pagan, Roman and barbarian, and different ethnic identities were surprisingly negotiable. It was a time when dramatic personal odysseys seem to have been common.

Thus, Alaric the Goth was also _Alaricus, magister militum per Ilyrias_ . Stilicho was half-Vandal but his daughter was for a while [the western empress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermantia). Stilicho and Alaric has fought shoulder to shoulder against Eugenius, a Roman usurper supported by the Roman-Frankish general Arbogast and bolstered by pagan omens (394) … yet Arbogast had was a key commander in the Roman armies which brought the Goths to heel after Adrianople, creating the nominal alliance which made Alaric a Roman commander (382). Stilicho and Alaric had fought in Greece (395 & 397) and in Italy (401), but Stilicho was the key proponent of cutting a deal with Alaric (408).

Late-Roman politics is a dizzying kaleidoscope: Alaric’s succesor Athaulf married Theodosius’ daughter, the pious [,Galla Placidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galla_Placidia) — a wedding celebrated by Alaric’s old puppet Attalus, the pagan-turned-Arian in flowery classical verses. Athaulf himself is quoted as saying this:

> At first I wanted to erase the Roman name and convert all Roman territory into a Gothic empire: I longed for Romania to become Gothia, and Athaulf to be what Caesar Augustus had been. But long experience has taught me that the ungoverned wildness of the Goths will never submit to laws, and that without law a state is not a state. Therefore I have more prudently chosen the different glory of reviving the Roman name with Gothic vigour, and I hope to be acknowledged by posterity as the initiator of a Roman restoration, since it is impossible for me to alter the character of this Empire

It didn’t work out, however: Athaulf was murdered by a fellow Goth (415), to avenge the death of Sarus — a Gothic subordinate of Stilicho who had fought against Alaric. At the time Athaulf was defending Honorius against a usurper named Jovinus, to whom Sarus had defected (413). But Athaulf, before the murder, had abandoned Honorius and declared Attalus emperor _again_ (414).

Like I said: negotiable.



* Orosius was writing to reassure his readers that the epoch-making sack of the city was punishment for the city’s refusal to part with its pagan ways; unsurprisingly his opponents claimed that sack reflected the city’s punishment for abandoning the traditional gods. When Orosius was writing around 416 Stilicho and his son were convenient scapegoats to absolve not just God but also the still-reigning Honorius of responsibility for the city’s fall.
