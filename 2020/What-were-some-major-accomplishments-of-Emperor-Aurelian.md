The most obvious achievements are the ones he trumpeted in his coins:

In his short five year reign Aurelian pulled the empire back from the brink of dissolution. When he was proclaimed emperor in 270, the empire was effectively split in three parts — in the west the so-callled [Gallic Empire](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/gallic-empire/) ruled over Gaul and Britain and in the East the Roman client-kingdom of Palmyra, under its formidable warrior Queen [Zenobia](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-Zenobia), was ruling over Syria, Cappadocia, the Levant and most importantly the vital grain supplies of Egypt.

This period is often known by the unfortunately accurate title of the “[Military Anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century).” When Aurelian was proclaimed emperor in 270, the Roman world had been convulsed by civil wars for two generations: there had been 26 would-be emperors since the assassination of Alexander Severus in 235. These revolts were usually driven by a mix of bare-knuckled power politics and local frustrations: the Gauls, for example formed their own government after their frontier defenses had been stripped to defend the east against the Persians. These warlords and faction heads were usually vague about the legal basis of their claims — Zenobia, for example, proclaimed her son in Latin as _vir clarissimus rex consul imperator dux Romanorum,_ rather than ruling openly by right of conquest. Still, the trend was clear: the central government could not protect the frontiers or command the loyalty of the main armies. It would have been entirely unsurprising if the empire had fractured permanently.

Aurelian’s place in history comes from the fact that he managed to weld the splintered pieces of the empire back together. In his short, five-year reign he re-unified the Roman world while also fending off a constant series of barbarian incursions and outlasting five or six rival claimants to the throne: quite a lot compressed into a short time frame. In 272-3, he reconquered the Levant from Zenobia, earning himself the title of _Restitutor Orientis_ , “restorer of the East”. In 274 he defeated the independent Gallic forces, returning the western provinces to the control of the central government as well. Another coin proclaimed Aurelian _Pacator Orbis_ , “pacificer of the world.” For the first time in 15 years the entire Roman world was under the control of the central government again.

Unfortunately Aurelian’s career was cut short: his coins may have proclaimed _Fortuna Redux,_ “Good luck has returned,” but Aurelian was assassinated in 275 while preparing a campaign against the Persians. Real stability would not return until the reign of [Diocletian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian). Nevertheless Aurelian plays a pivotal role in Roman history — had he been cut from the same cloth as most of the previous two dozen claimants to the throne, the Roman world might have fallen apart forever.

Aurelian also left one other very visible legacy:

The Aurelian walls of Rome were an emergency measure — the were the first permanent fortifications built around the city since the days of Augustus. They do show the tremendous vitality of third-century Rome even in the depths of its crisis: they run a circuit of almost 20 kilometers and featured nearly 400 towers (by comparison, the medieval walls of Paris were only about a quarter that size but took four times longer to complete.
