The Romans of _that_ period, no.

For one thing, during the Peloponessian war period Rome had no navy — the first Roman fleet wasn’t built until the 300’s, mostly for anti-piracy patrolling, and they didn’t have anything like ‘naval tradition’ until they improvised a fleet to take on the Carthaginians in the first Punic War in 260. They had to copy captured Carthaginian ships, having no serviceable ship of their own.

_The Roman world in 415 BC: Rome was still fighting Veii, 10 miles away. Rome only absorbed Fidenae — 5 miles away — in 435 BC when the Peloponessian war was about to begin_ 

Just as important, the Rome of, say, 415 BC was only a middling local power. They were still fighting wars in their immediate neighborhood, and they were far from the juggernaught of later years. It took Rome 10 years to conquer the Etruscan city of [Veii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veii), only an afternoon’s walk from Forum. And not long after having done so — a decade after the end of the Peloponessian war — Rome would be [conquered by the Gauls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Allia#Aftermath.2C_the_sack_of_Rome) and basically destroyed after a disastrous loss at the [battle of the Allia.](http://www.ancient.eu/article/879/)

On the other hand the neither Athens nor Sparta of 415 would have stood a serious chance against the armies of the later Republic which defeated the vastly larger and more sophisticated Hellenistic kingdoms of Macedon, Syria, and eventually Egypt. However, _that_ Rome was only made possible by the consolidation of Italy (particular after the [Second Samnite War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samnite_Wars#Second_.28or_Great.29_Samnite_War_.28326_to_304_BC.29), 326 - 304) and the defeat of Carthage in the first Punic War ( 264 - 241).

__TLDR__ : Camillus would never have had a chance to fight Brasidas or Alcibiades, but would have lost to them. On the other hand neither of them would have beaten Marcellus, Scipio Africanus or Titus Flamininus.
