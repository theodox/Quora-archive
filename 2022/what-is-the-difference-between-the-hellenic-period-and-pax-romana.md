If you’re talking time, the usual distinction is between the _Hellenistic Period_  and the _Roman period._ 

__Politically__ the Hellenistic era runs from Alexander the Great (323 BC) to Caesar’s conquest of Egypt (30 BC), or a little later (with the fall of the [Indo-Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek_Kingdom) kingdom which lasted another 20 years or so). After that, most of the Greek cultural world was incorporated into the Roman empire.

__Culturally__ the Hellenistic era doesn’t really “end” — a lot of what call the culture of the Roman Empire is really a continuation of Hellenistic styles and tastes down at least into the fourth century. More than half of the Roman world spoke Greek. Greek tastes and styles spread all over the Roman world, into places which had previously been unconnected to Greek arts and literature. Eventually, the “Roman” empire that survived into the Middle Ages was a Greek-speaking one headquartered in Constantinople. “Hellenistic” literally means “Greek-like” and it refers precisely to the spread of Greek cultural styles beyond Greek communities.

The _Pax Romana_  refers to two things.

As an __idea__ , it represents the success of the Roman empire in tamping down warfare — mostly, by winning its own wars and incorporating new areas into its territories. In places where small-scale wars and banditry were common before the Romans took over, the combination of peace and the lack of tariffs and borders unleashed a lot of economic potential. However in many places the it was Romans rather than locals who reaped most of the benefits.

As a __period__ , it reflects the era when the empire solidified enough to provide the benefits of the Pax Romana across most of the Mediterranean world. This is roughly from the conquest of Egypt (again, in 30 BC) down to the[ long series of Roman civil wars that began in 235 after the assassination of emperor Alexander Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century)). So, roughly 30 BC to 235 AD.
