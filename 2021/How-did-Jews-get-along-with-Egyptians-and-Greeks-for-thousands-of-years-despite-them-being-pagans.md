Uh, which Jews are we talking about here?

The ones whose [temple was deliberately desecrated by Antiochus IV, and who reacted with a guerilla war against the Seleucid Empire and their Greek-leaning neighbors?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabean_Revolt) The ones whose [temple was forced open by Pompey](http://S)? The ones who were massacred in the[ pogrom in Alexandria in 38 CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandrian_riots_(38))? Or maybe the ones in the riots of 40 CE? Perhaps the [50,000 dead in the riots of 66 CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_riot_(66))? Perhaps [the survivors of the destuction of Jerusalem and its temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_wars#First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War)? The survivors of the [Kitos War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War), which took hundreds of thousands of Gentile and Jewish lives ? Or the ones who were banned from Judaea after Hadrian tried to ban circumcision, [sparking another war ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt)in 132?

Or maybe just the Jews [expelled from Rome in 19](https://www.jstor.org/stable/263501?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)? Or those [expelled from Rome in the 40’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius%27_expulsion_of_Jews_from_Rome)? Just the ones who were mocked for being drunks, or accused of ritual cannibalism, or believed to spend the sabbath in orgies?

You might want to [read up a little on the history of Jewish-Greco-Roman relations,](https://www.quora.com/Are-the-traditional-accounts-of-Judeo-Greek-Judeo-Roman-relations-pre-Christian-realistic-and-consistent-Why-are-most-sources-Jewish-are-there-detailed-counterparts-from-the-Greek-or-Roman-perspective) which were anything but happy exercises in mutual understanding.
