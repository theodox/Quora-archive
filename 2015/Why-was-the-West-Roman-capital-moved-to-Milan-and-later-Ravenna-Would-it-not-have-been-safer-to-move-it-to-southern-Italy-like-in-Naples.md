# Why was the West Roman capital moved to Milan and later Ravenna? Would it not have been safer to move it to southern Italy, like in Naples?

The 'capital' was the military headquarters in this period: the emperors were, in theory at least, the supreme military commanders -- and in practice even if they had no interest in leading troops on the battlefield they had to keep a very close eye on their actual field commanders to make sure that they stayed on the throne (see both [Was splitting the Roman Empire a good decision in hindsight?](https://www.quora.com/Was-splitting-the-Roman-Empire-a-good-decision-in-hindsight) and [Why was the Roman succession so violent? Why weren't they able to establish a functional succession system like other large empires?](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires) for context). It's only a slight exaggeration to say the emperors were more worried about their own army than they were about the barbarians when they sited their headquarters.

So, you needed a city that was a communications hub, close enough to the frontier to react promptly to any problems coming over the _limes_  and also well placed to communicate with the civilian rear areas. Defense from invading armies wasn't the primary problem: running the widely spread Roman armies in an age with both tough communications problems and perennial military revolts strongly inclined emperors to forward positions. [Augusta Treverorum](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:entry=augusta-treverorum) (ie, Triers) played much the same role in the 4th century.


 The switch from Milan to Ravenna is at least partly an indication of how fragile the western military situation was: Ravenna, surrounded by swamps was more defensible -- but it also controlled the naval station at [Classe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe,_ancient_port_of_Ravenna) so it had better sea communications with the rest of the west -- particularly with Africa, which was the economic life's blood of the western empire in this period. Similar considerations probably motivated the shift of the Roman HQ in Gaul from Trier to [Arelate (Arles)](http://www.livius.org/arl-arz/arles/arles.html).

Notably some of the best surviving samples of Late Antique art come from this area, such as [Sant'Apollinare in Classe](http://www.ravenna-info.com/sant-apollinare-in-classe.htm)
