Actually there was not a single, legally defined class (at least, not one that all Greeks shared — there were cities with very strictly defined social classes but they were not uniform across all cities.

There were of course a lot of common terms, and though the don’t have the same exact legal definition or usage all over the Greek world they all boil down to “upper class”:

___aristoi___ _,_ ___ἄριστοι___ “the best” or “the best people” — this was a pretty common one, the root of our word _aristocracy._ 

___oligoi___ __, ὀλίγοι,__ “the few”; this kind of has the connotation of “wealthy” as well. You could be an _aristos_  by reason of good birth and still be particularly rich. This is the root of our _oligarchy._ When people say _hoi polloi_ to mean “ordinary people,” it’s recycling the old Greek contrast between the _oligoi_ , the few, and the _polloi_ , the many.

___kaloi k’agathoi___ __, καλοι κ'αγαθοι ,__ “The beautiful and good” This, er, “modest” phrase emphasizes the virtue of the upper class — their style and manners as well as physical beauty (which, being the only well-fed and well looked-after members of a society where most people didn’t get enough to eat all the time was a prime class attribute). Sometimes the shorthand would simply be ___kaloi.___ 

___gennaioi, γενναῖοι, eupatridai, Εὐπατρίδαι___ __ and ___eugenes, εὐγενής___ all mean “well born” or “of good family”. In some places _gennaios_ and _eugenes_ are synonyms for “noble” — but in others (say, democratic Athens) it’s more a term of moral approbation and respectability than of class. _Eupatridae_ did literally mean “noble” in early Athenian history but the Eupatridae lost their power pretty early in historical times and gradually came to refer to people with certain obscure religious rights and duties.

___plousoi___ __, πλούσιοι,__ “the rich” doesn’t mean “the nobility” — then as always there was tension between mere money and breeding. In some contexts, though, you could oppose the rich to the poor as a rough synonym for class conflicts.
