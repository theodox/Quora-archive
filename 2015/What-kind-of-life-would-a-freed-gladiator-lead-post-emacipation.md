The standard path for former slaves of any kind was to become a _libertus_ , a a "freedman". This made them legally free but with a mix of social and legal obligations to their former owners. Roman society was very 'pyramidal' it was organized into semi-formal networks of relationships between wealthier, more powerful "patrons" and less influential "clients". 

Freedmen automatically became clients of their former owners, expected to support them in politics and business and to follow their lead in social and business relations. It wasn't uncommon for a freedman to adopt the family name of the former owner as a symbol of that relationship. The line between "expected to" and 'required by law to" follow their patrons was fuzzy and changed over time, but it was a pretty powerful, universally recognized aspect of Roman society: you can sort of imagine it like getting a civil service jobs in a US city in the era of the big City Hall political machines: you had _obligations_  and you had to respect them if you didn't want trouble, and the role of the law in those obligations was secondary.

The exact legal status of a freedman also varied over time: a freedman in Rome became more or less a Roman citizen: able to vote and liable for military service, but excluded from the Senate and many other civic offices. A freedman in a provincial community which itself did not have citizen rights would not become a Roman citizen, and depending on the local laws might not be a full citizen of their home city either. After 212, the [Edict of Caracalla ](http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/law/g/CaracallaEdict.htm)made all free persons in the empire full citizens (though by that time "citizenship" really meant "liable to taxation", since the empire had been a monarchy for 200 years at that point and political competition was much less meaningful). Children of freedmen and freedwomen were full citizens. 

There were many instances of former slaves achieving great wealth and power, though the common examples were individuals who had served as highly placed bureaucrats or business advisors to wealthy and powerful Romans. Conservative Romans complained constantly about the wealth and influence of _nouveaux riches_ former slaves , which indicates considerable social mobility. At the same time, to have been a slave was regarded as at best a mark of misfortune, and wasn't a plus in "polite society".

Gladiators -- rather like modern professional athletes -- had celebrity and ready money as long as their luck held. However -- like modern athletes -- their careers were short and I'd expect that they had similar problems with managing their money. However I'm not aware of any primary sources that actually talk about this.
