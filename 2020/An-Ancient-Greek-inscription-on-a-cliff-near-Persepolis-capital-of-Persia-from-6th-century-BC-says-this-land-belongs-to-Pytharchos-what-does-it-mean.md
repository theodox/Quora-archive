The ‘Pytharchos inscription’ is really more like a graffito than an official inscription. It says literally ΠΥΘΑΡΧO ΕΙΜΙ, but the ‘O’ is what in later Greek would be written as -OY, indicating the possessive. So it says “I belong to Pytharchos”.

There’s plenty of room for guesswork here, but essentially it’s just a piece of graffiti. Pytharchos is a Greek name. The assertion of ownership might just be a graffiti tagger’s way of saying “this is my writing”, it, the “I” who belongs to Pytharchos is the writing itself. There are some examples of Greek graffiti from Egypt around the same time which use that form.

However the stone face where this was carved is evidently part of a quarry. So, the “I” might be a stretch of quarry where Pytharchos or his work-gang wanted first dibs on a good vein of stone. The Persians used Greek artisans extensively for building the palace complexes at Persepolis, so Pytharchos may have been a mason or a stonecutter — one of the workers that the [Persepolis Fortification Archives](https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/projects/persepolis-fortification-archive) refer to as _kurtash —_ and the graffiti was telling other Greek workers in the quarry to leave this area for him. It’s most likely that he was a supervisor of some kind, since literacy would not have been common among manual laborers; presumably the mark was one supervisor talking to other supervisors.
