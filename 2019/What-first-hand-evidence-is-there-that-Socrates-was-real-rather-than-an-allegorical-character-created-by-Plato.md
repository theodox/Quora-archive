If you discount Plato, there is still the first-hand account by [Xenophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon). who was a disciple of Plato as well as a military historian of note. Socrates also appears as a caricature in _[The Clouds](http://gtx2301aristophanes.blogspot.com/2009/02/socrates-as-portrayed-in-clouds.html)_ , by the comic poet Aristophanes. The picture in _The Clouds_ is not very accurate — Socrates stands in for every kind of impractical intellectual — but the casting is a clear indication that Aristophanes expected to recognize Socrates as an Athenian whose mind was lost in speculation.

There are other sources as well, collected in the answers here: [Did Socrates exist? Do we have any evidence outside of Plato that Socrates existed? Is it at all possible that Socrates was a literary construct?](https://www.quora.com/Did-Socrates-exist-Do-we-have-any-evidence-outside-of-Plato-that-Socrates-existed-Is-it-at-all-possible-that-Socrates-was-a-literary-construct) and [What works/books did Socrates write or were recorded by others?
