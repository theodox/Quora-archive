For a given value of “Pharaoh,” it was Persian emperor [Darius III Codomannos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_III), who ruled Egypt at the time of Alexander’s arrival.

_‘Darius’ in hieroglyphics_ 

The last native Pharoah of Egypt was [Nectanebo II,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectanebo_II) who had been defeated and chased into exile by the Persians a decade before Alexander’s war with Persia. Nobody knows what happened to Nectanebo after his disappearance, though the main reason the Persians were able to conquer Egypt was infighting among rival Egyptian factions — so it’s likely that he was done in by his compatriots.

However, [according to legend](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-evidence-that-Alexander-the-Great-was-not-European/answer/Steve-Theodore?share=d3251956&srid=zLvM) Nectanebo used magical powers to secretly father Alexander when king Philip of Macedon was not paying attention, so perhaps “last native Pharoah” is not strictly correct.
