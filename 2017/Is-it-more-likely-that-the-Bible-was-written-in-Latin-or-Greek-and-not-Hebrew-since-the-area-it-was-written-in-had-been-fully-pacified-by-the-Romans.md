# Is it more likely that the Bible was written in Latin or Greek and not Hebrew since the area it was written in had been fully pacified by the Romans?

The first Greek translation (known as the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint)) was done in the reign of Ptolemy II (281-246 BCE), more than two hundred years before the Roman conquest of Judaea. The [oldest surviving bits of the Hebrew text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketef_Hinnom) date from much earlier, around 600 BCE. Those small fragments don’t prove that the the modern text was current back then — but they do show that there was a Hebrew literary tradition with recognizable “biblical” elements centuries before the Greek version surfaced. The Latin versions are much later — the first one was a translation of the Septuagint, the [Vulgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate) was done from the Hebrew.

In any case, the scenario would not make sense. After the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 598 BCE a large portion of the Jewish people lived in Mesopotamia, particularly in Babylon; in Syria; and in Egypt. Since most of these people spoke the local languages in daily life, the Hebrew text was one of the main things keeping the community together: a Jew living in Mesopotamia would have no particular reason to read a Greek scripture. Translations were also made into Aramaic (~ 100 BCE) and Syriac (~ 150 CE). By the year 240 or so there was a [scholarly comparison edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexapla) featuring the Hebrew text (once in Hebrew, and once transliterated into Greek) along with four different Greek translations side by side.
