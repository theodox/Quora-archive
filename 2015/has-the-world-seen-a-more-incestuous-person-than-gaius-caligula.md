The same ancient rumor mill that tells spicy tales of Caligula and Drusilla also claimed that Nero had sex with his own mother, Agrippina (depressing original sources [here](http://www.johndclare.net/AncientHistory/Agrippina_Sources10.html)) Of course. the Ptolemaic dynasty (not unique in history but definitely an outlier in the Greco-roman world) was much given to incest as a way of keeping the kingdom in the family's hands (see [Incest and the Ptolemaic Dynasty](http://www.academia.edu/1897963/Ager_Familiarity_Breeds_Incest_and_the_Ptolemaic_Dynasty)).
