_gamely attempting an answer on a subject I know quite little about..._ 

I doubt it, for several reasons:


Greece's problems are too big even for Bill's checkbook. According to the interwebs, Bill is worth between $75 and $80 billion, depending on who you listen too. Greece's debt is higher than $372 billion. So even if Bill gave Greece all his money, they'd still be in debt. __Disclaimer: I have no independent knowledge of Bill's real net worth or Greece's real balance sheet.__ 

If Bill ever tried to liquidate his money to give it to Greece, he's lose a significant chunk to US taxes first. I've read that he owns somewhat more than 300 million shares of Microsoft; if he tried to sell it all he'd have to pay capital gains tax, which might consume as much as 20% of the total (I'd assume that some smart lawyering could knock that down somewhat, but I have no idea how much). I'm also not sure if the US government would want him to pay the gift tax for a gift given to a foreign government, but if they did that would be another significant chunk: the personal exemption something like $5 million -- nothing against $75 billion -- and the rate is I think the same as the estate tax rate: 40%. Without some special tax lawyering I'd expect Uncle Sam to get a big chunk of Greece's bailout. __DISCLAIMER: not only am I not a lawyer, I have nowhere near enough money to have any knowledge about this stuff at all! Maybe a real tax lawyer would have something useful to say.__ 

What's the long term effect of the bailout? Is it like loaning money to your brother-in-law to tide him over during an illness, knowing he'll get back on his feet? Or is it like lending money to your old roommate who has a drug habit, and is likely to blow it all on coke? Many governments get themselves into financial trouble, and often the results in some kind of quasi-bankruptcy deal in which old debts are written off and a "clean slate" is created to allow the country to move forward. Most countries hit this position only rarely, but some countries end up as serial defaulters: Argentina, for example, has defaulted 8 times since independence in 1824, and Venezuela 11 times according to [this wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_default). There is a certain kind of economist who will tell you that a bailout of this kind would be a bad idea, since it will send a signal that changes' aren't necessary and prevent needed reforms.

Perhaps the misery of the last decade will convince Greek voters to demand reform of their economic and fiscal structures in a "never again" sort of way. Or, maybe it will just send a signal that Greece is always going to find a rescuer, and that the unsustainable policies that created the current mess can be brought back with some cosmetic improvements. Some people read the position of the current Greek government as the former and some as the latter. 

All I know is that the [moral hazard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard) situation here is incredibly murky: there are 11 million Greeks, who will all react differently according to their own temperaments, ideologies and interests. For that reason I would be highly suspicious of anybody who says they "know" what the Greeks will do. I doubt most individual Greeks do, much less the nebulous entity of Greek "society". However, I'm quite sure that trying to figure it out is a key part of what the real-world bailout efforts are all about: so I'd assume that Bill -- who likes to think of himself as a non-traditional pragmatist who tries to solve problems without reference to old ideological categories -- will think it through too. Of course we've seen that efforts to use outside money to dictate changes in behavior haven't gone over too well in Greece either, so even a Bill Bailout might end up in recriminations and resentments like the current plan has . __Disclaimer: I met Bill at a party once, for about 30 seconds. But I have no idea what he think.__ 

If Bill bails out Greece, who will bail out Spain? or Portugal? Or Italy? The problems of southern Europe are very severe, with high unemployment, low growth, and no money in the bank. As the current politics over there shows, if the Greeks do get a break from the EU, the rest of southern Europe will be lining up for a share. Bill, riding on a chariot pulled by Warren Buffett, Bono, and the Aga Khan while being magically carried aloft by the ghost of Steve Jobs could not afford to bail out the whole southern tier of the EU. __Disclaimer: Warren Buffett is probably to old to pull a chariot.__
