In that case you’d have to rely primarily on content, since both of those words are formally ambiguous — it’s a sentence like ‘he hit him’ in English where you’d need extra information to distinguish the actors.

That said, most of the time Latin uses subject-object-verb order: it’s just a convention with no grammatical importance, but if you’re down to a coin toss due to suffix confusion, use the first noun as the subject.
