In one word: a respite.

285 marked a turning point in the endless series of civil wars which nearly destroyed the empire. The half-century following the death of [Alexander Severus](https://www.ancient.eu/Alexander_Severus/) in 235 was one of constant conflict: there were at least 26 would-be emperors in that 50 year span, all of whom enforced their claims at swordpoint and almost none of whom died of natural causes. Along with this civil chaos came barbarian invasions and foreign wars: one of the many low points of this period was the death of emperor [Valerian](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/valerian/) in a Persian prison (262). And, to top it all off, there was a twenty-year outbreak of the [plague](https://www.ancient.eu/article/992/) which decimated urban populations all over the empire.

_Diocletian_ 

In 285, a Roman general in the Balkans named [Diocletian](http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/diocletian.html) defeated the reigning emperor [Carinus](http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/carinus.html). Carinus was unusually terrible even by the low standards of this period — in fact Carinus was so terrible he was assassinated by his own troops, not beaten in a straight up fight. The armies reconciled on the battlefield and the endless conflicts — what modern historians call the [Military anarchy](http://www.crystalinks.com/CrisisoftheThirdCentury.html) — finally burned out.

Diocletian would remain on the throne for more 20 years — the longest reign in a century and a half — and his long reign provided badly needed breathing space for the war-torn empire. He reorganized the armies, secured the borders, mended the state’s desperate finances, and restored a sense of order to a society that was on the brink of collapse.

Diocletian was far from perfect. He was the most enthusiastic religious persecutor in Roman history, with tens of thousands of deaths on his hands. His [economic policies](http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2016/12/the-diocletian-edict-price-fixing-in.html) are still an object lesson in what _not_  to two millennia later. His effort to stabilize the chaotic Roman succession only outlived him by a couple of decades. He also [formalized the administrative division of the empire into eastern and western halves](https://www.quora.com/Who-divided-the-Roman-Empire-in-half/answer/Steve-Theodore), which would leads to the [final split of the empire two centuries later](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Roman-Empire-split-up-in-2/answer/Steve-Theodore). But even so, he gave the empire a second lease on life at a point when the odds were against survival.
