Yes. He literally [leveled Thebes](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/diodorus/the-sack-of-thebes/) in 336, and [killed most of the adult population of Tyre](http://www.livius.org/articles/battle/tyre-332-bce/). His [campaign against the Mallians in India was probably his most brutal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallian_Campaign), probably because was worried about the morale of his army which had already refused to follow him further east but also because his troops reacted viciously when Alexander was nearly killed storming a Mallian citadel.

There’s no way to attribute reliable death tolls to these campaigns, but in both Thebes and Tyre the military-age male population of both cities was wiped out and the remainder — probably about 30,000 people in both cases — was enslaved. The Mallian campaign written up in a confusingly scattershot way, but = since Arrian gives a figure of 5,000 military casualties for the fall of the Mallian citadel the civilian casualties here are probably in the same vein as the previous two cases.*

By the standards of other ancient conquerors Alexander was _comparatively_ genteel — his body count hardly registers compared to those of, say, of Julius Caesar or Genghis Khan, and his policy toward conquered peoples was generally very liberal . By way of comparison, Caesar claimed — though with a lot of exaggeration, it is true — to have killed or captured about 250,000 of the Helvetii alone and as many as 1.2 million Gauls.

However, “conqueror” is not an occupation which attracts the tenderhearted and Alexander was perfectly capable of murder on a large scale — as well as in person, as the case of Cleitus and his treatment of Callisthenes demonstrates.



_*On the other hand there’s no record of the Mallians being enslaved on masse after their surrender._
