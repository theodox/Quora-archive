It’s exactly that: the person of the ruler.

By the end of the republic, the army was composed primarily of people who were basically dependent on the ability of their generals to extract benefits from the Roman state on their behalf. The old militia armies of the second century BC and earlier were replaced by a full-time professional force, staffed mostly by landless men who would otherwise have been hard put to make a living. Although a legionary’s pay (and, if one were lucky, the occasional bout of booty) would keep body and soul together there was not much in the way of a retirement plan for those who made it through their full 16 years of service. If you wanted to settle down and start a family, you needed a land-grant: a spot in a veteran colony (usually, one outside of Italy where you would not have to compete economically against the vast, highly efficient estates of the Senatorial aristocracy).

Colonization and related payoffs for veterans were not a bureaucratic regularity — they were individually legislated and there was no guarantee that any given plan would actually pass. This meant that you needed to back your own general to the hilt: the best way to guarantee that there would be a good chance of retiring to your own farm in Tunisia or Spain or wherever was to make sure that your former commanding officer did well in politics. The _[clientela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage_in_ancient_Rome)_ system of mutual obligations meant that your former commander was responsible for you — but you, in return, were obliged to support his quest for higher offices and more prestige in the Senate.

In relatively peaceful times, this was a simple and fairly uncontroversial extension of the way clientela worked in other aspects of Roman society; most ordinary Romans were bound to some upper-class patron in some way. However when political tensions ran high, veterans groups became the nucleus of the gangs which frequently fought out contested issues in the streets of Rome. Even more than ordinary supporters, a former commander’s veterans _needed_  him to come out on top: his political capital was their biggest asset too.

So, when the riots gave way to actual military campaigns during the conflict between Marius and Sulla, it was pretty much inevitable that the ordinary soldiers would see their interests being more closely tied to the fortunes of their own commanders than to the abstract ideal of the Roman state. It often surprises modern commentators that the landless soldiers of Pompey’s legions would fight for the “aristocrats” against the “populists” — but to them it was quite obvious that being on the winning side meant personal rewards. Populist rhetoric was just that — words. The rewards of victory, in the form of money and land, were concrete. Pompey had already settled over 40 veteran colonies before the civil war, they had every reason to expect rewards if he won.

All that said, the soldiers were not mindless automata; they were perfectly capable of seeing how the odds were shifting and adapting accordingly. The civil wars produced many examples of defections — often by individual soldiers who surrendered on the field but on more than a few occasions entire legions switched sides, whether to join the side which looked poised to win, or because they had despaired of the competence or good will of their commanders.

A final factor which tied the soldiers to their commanders was the presence of large numbers of non-Romans in the “Roman” armies of the late Republic and early empire. In some cases, these were basically mercenaries, but in many cases they had their own kind of client relationship to a Roman commander — Caesar, for example, had a lot of Gallic cavalry split equally between Gallic tribes whom he had supported during his conquests and those he had conquered and spared. In both cases, the Gallic auxiliaries had a personal bond with Caesar that included no connection to Roman politics whatsoever.
