To the extent that you can take one man's word for it, [Polybius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius) is the most important ancient author for answering your question. He was literally an eye-witness to the climactic events of Rome's rise, and he made it his life's mission to explain to his Greek readership how Rome became the dominant world power of his age.

_Polybius as a young cavalry officer, probably around 180 BC._ 

__Eyewitness__ 

Polybius was the scion of a prominent family in the [Achaean League.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaean_League) Although the League had generally worked with the Romans, his father led the fight to keep the League from taking sides in the [war between Rome and Perseus of Macedon.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Macedonian_War) When the Romans [beat the Macedonians in 167,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pydna)  they took hostages to ensure that the League remained docile. Polybius was one of them. 

As an aristocrat from a politically prominent family Polybius moved in the highest circles of Roman society -- he was friendly with [Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Aemilius_Paullus_Macedonicus) (the victor of Pydna) and [Scipio Aemilianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scipio_Aemilianus). Although his 'hostageship' ended in 150 he was comfortable enough at Rome that he stayed on, eventually accompanying Scipio on campaigns in Africa and Spain. He was an eyewitness to the fall of Carthage in 149 - and also a helpless witness to the destruction of Corinth in 146.

__Roman Virtue__ 

For most of his life, Polybius viewed the Romans with a mixture of condescension and awe. He retained a typical Greek sense of superiority to Roman cultural achievements, but as a practical politician he was extremely impressed by Roman discipline, patriotism, and civic spirit -- virtues which he felt were sadly lacking in the Greece of his own day. 

His early view of Rome tends toward idealization -- something reminiscent of the starry-eyed "everything is better in Europe" view that often comes home from a semester abroad program (and to some degree for the same reason: he didn't spend time in the slums or in the countryside, where the spoils of the empire were beginning to destroy the sturdy rural farmers who were the backbone of the Rome he describes).

You can see how Polybius tried to understand this unfamiliar culture in traditional Greek terms. Particularly in [Book VI](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/6*.html) he  analyzed Roman politics in terms of the Greek 'cycle of constitutions' -- the idea, dating back to Herodotus, that societies tend to cycle from monarchical to aristocratic to democratic and then back to monarchical government over time. He saw Roman politics as combining elements of all three systems in a way which made it more stable than the Greek variety. Not entirely by coincidence the theory of 'mixed government' that Polybius evolved in his effort to understand (and to idealize) Rome became very important in modern political theory -- it was central to the writings of Machiavelli, Montesquieu and Locke among others after Polybius was rediscovered during the 16th century.

__Nemesis__ 

Later in life Polybius had to confront a very different face of Rome. 

When Polybius was an infant, Rome was defeating Hannibal's Carthage, Macedon, and a terrifying Gaulish invasion. By the time he reached middle age Rome has passed from fighting for survival to dominant power, and he began to sense a change in the mores of younger Romans who had grown up knowing only victory and the spoils of empire. They were more arrogant and less restrained, more brutal and less foresighted than their ancestors. They casually destroyed Carthage when it posed no threat.

And, in 146, they put down Polybius' own Achaean League with a swift campaign that culminated in the brutal [sack of Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Corinth_(146_BC)) in order to "teach a lesson" to Greeks who thought they could defy Rome. The conflict was supposedly about Rome's refusal to let the Achaean League permanently absorb Sparta. However it was really about Greek fear of Roman power, and there was fighting in other parts of Greek not controlled by the League.

Polybius had to watch in agony as the nation he admired so much brutalized his home. His [Book XXXVI through XXXIX](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/36*.html) are written in largely in the first person, as he was present during the Roman destruction of the Achaean League and the fall of Corinth.  He exerted himself to save what he could, using his political connections and his eloquence on behalf of the defeated -- but he was, of course, in the awkward position of being a collaborator with a foreign occupation. 

__Greek Nationalism__ 

The tragic conflict does however point out that there was an organized body of anti-Roman sentiment in Greece at the time. 

Historically Achaea had been pro-Roman and anti-Macedonian, but the defeat of Macedon in the [Fourth Macedonian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Macedonian_War) seems to have convinced a significant number of Greeks that Rome was a scarier threat. The Macedonians were generally pretty unpopular in Greece proper and in the prior century Rome generally was regarded as a more benevolent power -- but when Rome dethroned the last Macedonian king and annexed Macedon in 146 many Greeks became nervous. 

It was this fear that was exploited by Greek politicians like [Diaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaeus)  to move the Achaeans to declare war on Rome in 146, despite impossible odds. His description - which of course reflects his conflicted feelings - makes it seem like a kind of mass hysteria:

>  As all this was happening at one and the same time, the dismay created by the particular events of every day rendered people incapable of that general and careful reflection, which would have made them foresee that they all with their wives and children were clearly on the road to ruin. [2](#) So, as if carried away and swept down by the force a fierce torrent, they resigned themselves to the demented and perverse guidance of their leader. [3](#) The people of Elis and Messene indeed remained at home in expectation of an attack by the fleet, but they would have profited nothing by the circumstances if that cloud had appeared on their horizon as was originally contemplated. [4](#) The people of Patrae and those who contributed assistance together with them had a short time previously met with disaster in Phocis, and their case was much more lamentable than that of their allies in the Peloponnese; [5](#) for some of them in strange desperation had put an end  to their lives, and others were flying from the cities across country, directing their flight to no particular place, but terror-stricken by what was taking place in the towns. [6](#) Some arrested others to surrender them to the enemy as having been guilty of opposition to Rome, and others informed against their friends and accused them, although no such service was demanded of them at present. Others again presented themselves as suppliants, confessing their treachery and asking what their punishment should be, in spite of the fact that no one as yet demanded any explanation of their conduct in this respect. [7](#) The whole country in fact was visited by an unparalleled attack of mental disturbance, people throwing themselves into wells and down precipices, so that, as the proverb says, the calamity of Greece would even arouse the pity of an enemy, had he witnessed it.[8](#) In former times indeed they had erred gravely and sometimes entirely come to grief, quarrelling now about questions of state and now betrayed by despots, but at the time I speak of they met with what all acknowledge to be a real calamity owing to the folly of their leaders and their own errors.

[XXXVIII.16](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/38*.html) 

 Besides survivor's guilt Polybius as a practical statesman was appalled and outraged at the stupidity of this rash decision, which lead directly to the destruction of Corinth -- the worst tragedy in the Greek world since Xerxes' destruction of Athens.

Over the next century Greek resentment remained, manifesting itself in support (largely ineffectual, however) for [Mithridates of Pontus. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus)However Roman rule generally turned out pretty well for the Greeks -- Greek cities had generally been paralyzed by factional politics with different Hellenistic powers (Macedon, Ptolemaic Egypt, and the Seleucid Empire) backing rival groups. Without outside support Greek politics generally became less vitriolic and less violent. Despite the unusual brutality of the sack of Corinth, Roman rule in Greece was pretty mild. Polybius attributed this to the incompetence and hysteria of the anti-Roman faction, which botched the war so badly that the Romans were more bemused than vengeful:

> Everybody in fact kept repeating the proverb, "Had we not perished so soon we would never have been saved."

The final settlement generally benefitted local elites: Until well into the second century AD the Roman empire relied very heavily on local governments and did not deeply insert itself into local laws or customs. Some elements of anti Roman sentiment cropped up in the form of oracles and prophecies, but after the defeat of Mithradates by Pompey there was no organized resistance. 

Greeks did retain an unsinkable confidence in the superiority of their culture, but they tended to bow to the superior military and political acumen of Rome. If there had been a serious rival to Roman power -- if the Ptolemies or the Seleucids had been less feckless or less corrupt -- things might have been different. But Greek politics had been dominated by outside powers for so long that Greek nationalism was almost entirely cultural rather than political. There's a notable upswing from this period in efforts to weave Roman experience into Greek tradition. A good indicator of how it fell out is how Polybius' reputation in the Greek world remained high after his death despite his ambiguous status -- an interesting contrast to the literary fate of the Jewish-Roman historian [Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus) who occupied a similarly awkward position.
