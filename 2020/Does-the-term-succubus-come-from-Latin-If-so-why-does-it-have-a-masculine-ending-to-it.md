It does come from Latin — and it was originally feminine, _succuba_  (from _sub_ , “under” and _cubare_ , “to lie down”. It originally meant, essentially, a prostitute.

In the Middle Ages a separate word, _incubus_ , came along. Incubus come from _in_ , “in or on”, and _cubare._ An incubus was a spirit that “lay down” on top of a sleeper — sometimes it was a form of night paralysis, but in other contexts it was reputed to violate women in their sleep.

“Succubus” is believed to come from the confusion of the (male) naughty-night-spirit and the (female) prostitute, creating a supernatural slut with a confused grammatical, if not gender, identity. However, strictly speaking, the second declension is not uniformly masculine — _humus,_ for example, the word for “ground” and _ficus,_ “fig tree” are both grammatically feminine.
