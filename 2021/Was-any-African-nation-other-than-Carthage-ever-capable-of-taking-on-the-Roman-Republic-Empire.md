First off, a minor caution: “nation” is not necessarily a good concept to use for this period — almost every state in this era bigger than a two-days walk was more like what we would call an “empire,” with a ruling minority and a diverse collection of subject peoples. The Carthage you see on a modern map, for example:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b82818fe8f776aa712dd9d100496ac25)

was hardly populated by a uniform Carthaginian people or culture — most of the people who lived under Carthaginian rule were Libyans, Numidians, Mauri, Iberians, Sicels, Balaeri, or Sardinians and each of those groups itself contained more localized hierarchies of rule. So in the map above the red “Carthaginian” empire includes several kingdoms and city-states which continued to function locally and which could also, under the right circumstances, act independently: the final Carthaginian defeat owed a lot to the fact the several factions of Numidians (mostly, from modern Algeria) switched sides and supported the Romans against their Carthaginian neighbors/allies/overlords.

__The Maghreb__ 

So, these states were not unified, self conscious nations in a modern sense. A corollary to that was the status often mattered a lot more than ethnicity: in the Carthaginian empire, for example, the Punic-descended Carthaginian elite ruled the roost, but a noble Carthaginian like [Hannibal’s niece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophonisba) married a Numidian prince without raising any eyebrows. When the Romans arrived their system included, rather than eliminating local elites as well: just as in Gaul or Greece, it was often a lot more profitable for a North African nobleman to adopt a second identity as a Roman aristocrat than it would have been to pursue a “nationalist” course. Eventually there would be North African emperors — the [Severan dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severan_dynasty), [Aemilian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aemilianus), and [Macrinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus).

That said: here’s the real reason why North Africa outside of Carthage did nor produce a Great Power during this era:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d939177534092557a3ecfc5b5b2488f8)

It’s the availability of agricultural land, not size on a satellite map, which limited the strategic potential of the region. It’s absolutely true that North Africa is not the stereotypical desert people might assume: in fact modern Tunisia and Algeria eventually became the breadbasket of the Roman Empire. However, the easily exploitable lands are confined to the coasts. More importantly, they are dependent on sophisticated irrigation techniques to be really productive: the region cannot prosper on rainfall alone. That kind of intensive agricultural investment started with the Carthaginians and really took off under the Romans — it required tremendous capital, the organization of large scale labor, and borrowed techniques from elsewhere around the Mediterranean world: Greek dams, Roman aqueducts, and Persian qanats.

_The mighty_ _[Zaghouan aqueduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaghouan_Aqueduct#:~:text=The%20Zaghouan%20Aqueduct%20or%20Aqueduct,aqueducts%20in%20the%20Roman%20Empire.)_ _brought water to Roman Carthage — at 132 km, it’s a contender for the title of longest Roman aqueduct. It formed a part of a vast and very resource-intensive set of water control projects which made Roman North Africa prosperous and fertile. It remained a key to the regional water supply until the 17th century._ 

Before the centuries-long development of that water infrastructure the population was simply not very large. Conflicts between nomadic pastoralists in the interior and coastal farmers were endemic: it’s worth nothing that the local non-Carthaginian populations were all famous as cavalry troopers, rather than as infantry: like the steppe nomads of Eurasia, their way of life was centered on the saddle.

_Numidian cavalry fighting in the Balkans, from_ _[Trajan’s Column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Column)_ _._ 

As in Eurasia, many of these groups could exert military control over their settled neighbors: for a long period after the end of the Carthaginian empire, various Numidian groups dominated the old Punic cities of the coastline:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-42a648a659c4c58c1f39b066ef0e90d1)

_Here again the solid coloring is misleading — but from the fall of Carthage until the early imperial period, Numidian states like the Maesyli and the Massylii controlled the old Punic settlements of the coast as well as the pastoral lands of the interior)_ 

Unlike the steppe-nomads, however, the geographic range (and thus, the population) of groups like the Numidians was strictly limited by the Sahara. The tension between the coast lands and the interior never went away — a recurrent pattern in the later rebellions against Roman rule was that they centered on regions where settled agriculture and nomadic pastoralism collided: rebels like [Tacfarinas](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/tacfarinas/) could rely on the mobile pastoralists of the interior, who were harder to control and who competed for land with the coastal agricultural centers. The environmental limits of the region made it hard for a full-blown steppe empire like that of the Huns or the Mongols to emerge. Another limiting factor was the the fact that domesticated camels didn’t show up until the Roman era. In earlier times movement and trade across the Sahara was much more difficult than it would be during the heyday of the medieval caravan trade (when, of course, it was hardly a picnic).

_This map of Roman Africa shows how tightly the urban centers cluster near the coast — only in the highlands of modern Tunisia and far-eastern Algeria do the big settlements reach far inland._ 

The narrowness of the easily habitable region put a cap on the power of any state centered in this region. Carthage stands out, because it had a unique resource in the form of its colonial network outside of North Africa:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f47fb87ddb70d0fe6933d08e13239123)

_This map tends to understate Carthaginian presence on the east coast of Iberia. You’ll note the route through the Pillars of Hercules: the Carthaginians completely closed this route to foreign shipping, so they profited from all trade coming to from the Atlantic._ 

That trade network (and a near monopoly on seaboard trade in the western Mediterranean) gave Carthage economic reach which no other local power could aspire to. And, of course, having a dominant Carthage in the region tended to put all the other local powers in the position of competing with Carthage, rather than pursuing their own regional aspirations.

There were still strong regional polities in North Africa. The [Garamantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamantes) of the central Sahara, who had [a sophisticated water system in their isolated homeland](https://www.world-archaeology.com/features/garamantes-libya/), could never really be subdued in their desert strongholds (the Romans briefly conquered their capital under Septimius Severus, an emperor who descended from Carthaginian stock and who grew up in North Africa, probably with some local scores he wanted to settle). The [Mauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauri#:~:text=Mauri%20(from%20which%20derives%20the,the%20Berber%20population%20of%20Mauretania.) — who give their name to the “Moors” of later times — played both sides of the game: somebody like [Juba II of Mauretania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II) was a valued Roman ally, a friend of Augustus Caesar and who corresponded with Greek scientists and married Cleopatra’s daughter. However in the rugged interior, the Atlas Mountains were extremely difficult for any coastal power to control (a pattern which persisted all the way up to the colonial era) and the line between “bandit” and “resistance fighter” was very much in the eye of the beholder. The [Numidians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numidians#:~:text=The%20Numidians%20were%20the%20Berber,relationship%20with%20the%20Numidians%20blossomed.) of Algeria were for several centuries sometime-rivals and sometime-allies of first the Carthaginians and then the Romans — for centuries Numidian cavalry was a common sight on Roman battlefields from Syria to Scotland.

So it’s not as if North Africa was a complete backwater: it’s simply that none of these states had the kind of strategic reach which would have made it a contender outside its own neighborhood. Carthage stands out from the others because it was always part of a connected web of trade across the Mediterranean. Even so, the “Carthaginian” armies which fought the Romans were mostly staffed by a multi-cultural array of mercenaries and subjects from Iberia, Sicily, Libya and Gaul, who could only be recruited and paid for thanks to Carthage’s maritime trade network. The Carthaginians, after all, had arrived by sea and were descendants of the far-flung Phoenician merchants. Their commercial connections and, until they were defeated by the Romans, their command of the seas in the western Mediterranean made them far wealthier than their North African neighbors.

Still none of these states — not even, as events would show, Carthage — was in the same league as the contemporary Roman empire in terms of size or resources. Carthage itself was a tremendous anomaly: the city of Rome, which peaked at around a million people under the early empire, was an artificial creation that could only achieve that kind of population using the profits of empire. Carthage, which peaked around 500,000 people at the end of its empire, was even more unnaturally large: it may have represented more than half of the regional population.* This illustrates the connection between political power and population density — a connection from which North Africa eventually benefitted. Rome’s outsized growth brought late-Roman North Africa to a peak of prosperity — [the huge state-sponsored infrastructure which brought North African grain to feed Rome created tremendous wealth in the grain-lands of Tunisia and Algeria](https://www.africanexponent.com/post/7644-here-is-how-africa-built-the-roman-empire-through-agriculture-and-food-supplies). The shipping lanes which handled the bulk trade also cut costs for a huge trade in pottery, oils, and the exotica which arrived via the trans-Saharan trade.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-662fad96efcd7f0bc2f974a5d73d450e)

_We don’t have good population statistics for the Carthaginian era — but the distribution of urban centers gives a reasonable proxy for population density. Note the disparity between Italy and North Africa in this image — which comes from a period when the North African population was_ booming: _within another century, Carthage would be the second largest city in the Latin speaking world and, at 500,000 or so people, the third largest in the empire. Nonetheless most of North Africa was thinly populated._ 

However the connection to the Roman trade network was vulnerable. Once cheap, safe transport of agricultural good across the Mediterranean stopped — first thanks to the [Vandals ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandal_Kingdom)and then to a millennium of conflict between Muslim and Christian navies — the population returned to its earlier low levels and large portions of the region returned to nomadic pastoralism. The Maghreb probably did not return to its peak late-Roman population until the 15th century.

__“Ethiopia” and Axum__ 

The other Roman-African contact of note came farther east, up the Nile Valley from Roman-occupied Egypt.

Here again, environmental constraints put a limit on the growth of states in the region — if you refer again to the first map you’ll see that the upper Nile valley runs through another challenging region which puts strict limits on population. The local powers — like Egypt — were able to exploit the Nile to support their population but the surrounding geology could not support the kind of dense settlement that characterized Egypt. On the other hand, in the Roman period, the growth of the Indian Ocean maritime trade benefited the local powers — particularly farther south, towards the Horn of Africa — and encouraged a more cooperative, almost symbiotic relationship across the border.

The Roman conquest of Egypt (which they wrested from the hands of the Greek-speaking Ptolemaic dynasty) brought them in contact with the [kingdom of Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush), which they usually referred to as “Aethiopia” even though it is in the northern part of what we’d refer to as Sudan.

Kush — governed from its capital city of [Meroe](https://www.worldhistory.org/Meroe/) — was a regular participant in the commerce and diplomatic exchanges around the Red Sea from very early on. Besides the familiar site of Kushite mercenaries in Egypt, Kushite levies had accompanied the Persian army that invaded Greece in 480 BC. By the time the Romans arrived the Kushites had routine interactions not only with Egypt but with Arabia and Judea. The “Ethiopian” eunuch who [meets the apostle Philip in the New Testament is a servant of the Kandake, the queen of Kush](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%208%3A26-40&version=ESV), returning from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem: testimony to the web of connections in the region.

That Egyptian border had seen Egyptian-Kushite conflicts for hundreds of years before the Romans arrived. As the Romans consolidated their hold on Egypt they also came into conflict with their southern neighbors. [A short but intense war (27–22 BC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanirenas) saw victories for both sides. It ended with a negotiated peace which lasted for about three centuries until the Kushite kingdom collapsed for internal reasons.

It’s not surprising that the border was stable. The boundary between Egypt and its southern neighbors had long been close to the first cataract of the Nile (near modern Aswan) which marked a highly defensible bottleneck to various empires for more than two thousand years. Sending and maintaining armies through that region was a daunting effort under ancient conditions. The Egyptians and the Kushites had both managed to exert control through the cataracts — most famously, from around [750 to 650 BC when the Kushites controlled all of Egypt.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt). The long-term strategic norm was a border around either first or the second cataract of the Nile (roughly modern Aswan and Wadi Halfa)..

In any case, cooperation was also an easy choice for both parties. Since the days of the Ptolemies, the prosperity of the region depended in large part on trade. The Ptolemies had collaborated with the Kushites during their efforts to create [a domestic elephant-breeding industry](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-historical-fact-you-know-off-the-top-of-your-head/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=3532e59f&srid=zLvM); gold, ivory, and metalwork headed north while food, wine, and luxury goods headed south.

_[Two monuments from the Kushite kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqa)_ _illustrating centuries of cultural interchange in the region. On the left the Egyptian-style temple is actually devoted to the Kushite god_ _[Apedemak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apedemak#:~:text=Apedemak%20or%20Apademak%20was%20a,man%20with%20a%20lion%20head.)_ _, The temple on the right is, by contrast, honors the Egyptian goddess Hathor but is built in a distinctly Roman style._ 

In the late Ptolemaic and Roman periods as new economic force appeared in the region: the vast and lucrative trade network linking [Egypt, East Africa and India](https://www.quora.com/I-have-heard-that-ancient-Greece-and-Rome-were-having-trades-with-south-Indian-kingdoms-But-in-history-why-werent-these-given-much-importance-and-not-talked-about/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=70e19e91&srid=zLvM) through the Indian Ocean. This created a new power in the region, the the [kingdom of Axum,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum) centered in modern Eritrea which controlled important ports on the critical routes to India and Africa. The rise of Axum coincided with the gradual weakening of Kush; as the new power to the south rose the old Kushite kingdom weakened, disappearing around the end of the third century.

Roman-Axumite relations were usually friendly. The Axumites embraced Christianity early, thanks to close cultural ties with Roman Egypt — in fact, Axumite coins were the first ever use of Christian iconography in a political context. Axumite armies [cooperated with the Romans against the Persians in the sixth century ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksumite%E2%80%93Persian_wars)(though as co-belligerents, not on the same battlefields).

_A Persian fresco showing the war fought between Persian and Axumite forces in the Arabian peninsula in the 570’s_ 

Contemporary observers described Axum as the fourth “Great Power” of the age, the other three being Rome, Persia and China. Since Roman and Axumite armies never faced off against each other there’s no real evidence for what the balance of power looked like. It’s certain that their control over a key link in the Indian Ocean trade network made them a wealthy and formidable contender, but our understanding of their resources and demographics is not strong enough to really rank them.

Axum’s had only limited power in the old Kushite heartland and new population groups that moved into that power vacuum. In particular the [Nobatae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobatia) and the [Blemmyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blemmyes) were originally pastoralists who came to power in different parts of the old Kushite kingdom. There they adopted some of the old Kushite institutions as well as contemporary Egyptian and Axumite ideas. Both groups (and a few smaller ones as well) had on-again, off-again conflicts with Roman Egypt. The most important conflict came when Blemmye raiders allied with the [Zenobia of Palmyra](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-Zenobia/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=5b4f5b16&srid=zLvM) during her invasion of Egypt. They scored some successes during that conflict but were ultimately crushed when the Romans retook Egypt and destroyed Palmyra.

Starting around 300, the Romans backed the Nobatae, who displaced the Blemmyes along the Nile valley and formed a reliable buffer state which protected Egypt from other nomadic raiders. The Nobatae were eventually merged (under circumstances we don’t quite understand) into the kingdom of [Makuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makuria) which managed to retain its independence from Arabized Egypt down to the 13th century.

In the fifth and sixth centuries Nobatian forces worked routinely with the Romans. In fact the Romans occasionally loaned Nobatian troops to the support their allies in Axum.

To return to the original question:

Only the Carthaginians and — before it went into decline in the second century BC — Ptolemaic Egypt were in the same military league as their Roman contemporaries. In both the Maghreb and East Africa there were serious environmental constraints on the power of the other states. That said, the power imbalance was never so stark that Rome’s African neighbors made attractive targets: where the neighboring states were fairly strong it was easier and cheaper to have good relations. Conflicts were more likely in times and places when the border territories were contested by nomadic or pastoral people, accustomed to raiding and not easily pinned down by conventional warfare. But — unlike the case in the Eurasian steppes — the environment along the southern Roman frontier could not easily support the emergence of large nomad-driven empires



* All of these estimates, however, are pretty shaky: we don’t have the kind of data we’d need to be really confident about any of them. The Roman geographer Strabo, a couple of centuries after the fact, put the Carthaginian empire at the time of its defeat at around 700,000 people in 300 cities; he doesn’t say so but since accounts of the last Punic war put the population of the city proper at 500,000 or so, that would make Carthaginians an absolute majority of the regional population — though in this case the “region” is limited to modern Tunisia and does not count the Numidians, Mauri, and Libyans. It’s generally assumed the population of North Africa peaked around the 5th century, collapsed around the time of the Arab conquest, and didn’t rebound completely until the 16th century.
