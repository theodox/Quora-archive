It’s not a particularly rational distinction.

Mostly it reflects the traditionally ambiguous feelings of western European historians about the East Roman state and society. At some point between the fifth and the tenth century “they” cease to be “us” *, and the new name reflects that.

That sense of belonging or not is of course rooted in old divisions. Originally these were Latin versus Greek and Catholic versus Orthodox. The 18th and 19th centuries added first bourgeois liberal or Whig versus traditionalist and ‘clearly white’ versus ‘ambiguously European’ to the pre-existing psychological distance. Even today, Greek history is beset by an ambiguous relationship to the rest of Europe's self-image, as current politics makes distressingly clear.

The term “Byzantine Empire” was evidently coined in the 16th century by a German historian editing a collection of East Roman historical documents. It became pervasive because it provided a neat way for early-modern writers who cared a lot about Scipio, Cicero, and Caesar — but not so much about Commenus, Chrysostom and Photius — to focus on the Roman antiquity they cared about and to jettison aspects of the Roman heritage they found distasteful. The ultimate example of this is Gibbon, whose attitudes pretty much created the [negative stereotypes that go with the word “Byzantine”](https://www.quora.com/Was-the-Byzantine-Empire-actually-byzantine-If-so-how) in English.



* Usual globalized caveats apply: An English-speaking Pakistani or Nigerian is unlikely to adopt those Western European pronouns , but still inherits the vocabulary which the western perspective created.
