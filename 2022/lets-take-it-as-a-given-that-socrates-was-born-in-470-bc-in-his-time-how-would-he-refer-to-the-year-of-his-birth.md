Depending on when in our calendar it would be “in the archonship of Praxiergus“ or “in the archonship of Demotion.” The annual rotation of archons was the usual way Athenians marked the passage of the years.



Speaking to someone from another city he might have said “in the [first / second] year of the seventy-seventh Olympiad” — the four year Olympic cycle was a handy tool for comparing dates across the multitude of conflicting local calendars.

All that said it would be more natural for him to simply say, “ten years after the Persians came” since that would tell any Greek hearer what they wanted to know in an instantly recognizable form. In a world without a common serial dating system it was quite common to use important events as landmark — a system which works well within living memory but becomes pretty fuzzy after a couple of generations, much to the dismay of modern historians.
