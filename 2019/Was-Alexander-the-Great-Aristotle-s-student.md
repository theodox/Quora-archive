Yes. The philosopher’s family was already connected to Macedonia’s royal family; Aristotle’s father was a court physician in Macedonia working for [Amyntas III,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyntas_III_of_Macedon) who preceded Alexander’s father [Philip II ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Macedon)on the throne.

In 348 BC (when Alexander was 8) Philip destroyed Aristotle’s home town of [Stagira ](http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2463)during a war against the Greek cities of the northeast Aegean. Five years later, Philip hired Aristotle as tutor to the young prince — a somewhat surprising choice for a king who was known to be rather paranoid. Some of the sources say that Aristotle convinced the king to rebuild the city and allow its population to return; that may be why Philip didn’t worry that his son would be endangered by a vengeful exile. The other tradition is that Alexander rebuilt the city out of gratitude to his teacher.

There’s not a lot of reliable detail about the relationship in the ancient sources. The [fullest account](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/plutarch/plutarchs-alexander/alexander-and-aristotle/) comes from Plutarch’s _Life of Alexander_ , writing about 400 years after the fact (but with access to sources we have lost). This little exchange gives an insight into the character of both men:

> As a place for the pursuit of their studies and exercise, he assigned the temple of the Nymphs, near Mieza, where, to this very day, they show you Aristotle's stone seats, and the shady walks which he was wont to frequent.

> It would appear that Alexander received from him not only his doctrines of Morals and of Politics, but also something of those more abstruse and profound theories which these philosophers, by the very names they gave them, professed to reserve for oral communication to the initiated, and did not allow many to become acquainted with. For when he was in Asia, and heard Aristotle had published some treatises of that kind, he wrote to him, using very plain language to him in behalf of philosophy, the following letter.

> _Alexander to Aristotle, greeting. You have not done well to publish your books of oral doctrine; for what is there now that we excel others in, if those things which we have been particularly instructed in be laid open to all? For my part, I assure you, I had rather excel others in the knowledge of what is excellent, than in the extent of my power and dominion. Farewell._ 

> And Aristotle, soothing this passion for pre-eminence, speaks, in his excuse for himself, of these doctrines as in fact both published and not published:

> _As indeed, to say the truth, his books on metaphysics are written in a style which makes them useless for ordinary teaching, and instructive only, in the way of memoranda, for those who have been already conversant in that sort of learning._ 

Plutarch goes on to say

> Doubtless also it was to Aristotle that he owed the inclination he had, not to the theory only, but likewise to the practice of the art of medicine. For when any of his friends were sick, he would often prescribe them their course of diet, and medicines proper to their disease, as we may find in his epistles.

In any case, the relationship was famous in antiquity and has been ever since.

Here’s a medieval Aristotle (and an assistant) lowering Alexander into the sea in a glass barrel so he can observe life below the waves.
