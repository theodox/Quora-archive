# Could it be possible that the original Chinese name for the Roman empire "大秦" (Dà Qín) has to do with the Dacians living in East Europe?

It is very unlikely, primarily because the surviving Chinese sources seem exclusively concerned with Roman Egypt and Roman Syria. Chinese visitors appear to have treated Antioch (An-tu) in Syria, as the capital of the empire. They also knew about Alexandria and Nabataea (aka Petra, of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade fame). There is however no clear mention of Rome itself, or parts further north. Late sources do mention Constantinople — but by that point the preferred name for the Roman lands is Fulin, not Daqin.
