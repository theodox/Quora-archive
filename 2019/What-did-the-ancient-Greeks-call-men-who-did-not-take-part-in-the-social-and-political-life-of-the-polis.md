Idiots. No, literally.

__[ἴδιος](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=i%29%2Fdios&la=greek&can=i%29%2Fdios0&prior=to/&d=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:alphabetic%20letter=*i:entry%20group=5:entry=i)/dion&i=1#lexicon)__ _(idios)_  is the Greek adjective for “personal” or “private” — as opposed to “common” or “public”. πράσσειν τὰ ἴδια (_prassein ta idia)_ is “to mind your own business” , literally “to do private things.”

In the conventional Greek view, private matters were of lesser importance: a real Greek was devoted to the life of the city, to _politika_  rather than _idia._ So, person who only tended their private affairs was derided as an __[ιδιώτης](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=i)diw/ths)__ _(idiotes)_  — somebody who messed around with their private concerns instead of contributing the life of the polis.

Since politics tended to be the realm of the gentry, _idiotes_  had an inescapable class connotation: a tradesman, who spent all his time earning a living rather than debating issues in the agora, was a mere _idiotes_  in the eyes of his social superiors, so _idiotes_  came to mean “commoner” as opposed to “aristocrat.” That aristocratic scorn gradually redefined the word to mean someone uneducated (again, in the eyes of the elite) so in later Greek and in it’s Latin form __idioticus__  it came to mean a clodhopper or a dunce, giving rise to the meaning “idiot” has today.
