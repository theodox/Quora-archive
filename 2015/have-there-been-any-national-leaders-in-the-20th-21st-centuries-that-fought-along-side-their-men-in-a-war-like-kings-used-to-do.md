# Have there been any national leaders in the 20th/21st centuries that fought along side their men in a war like kings used to do?

World war I was so all encompassing that it brought many future leaders into the trenches, although mostly as young men -- almost all of the leaders of the Second World War (including Hitler) had served as young men in the first.

There were a few notables in the trenches, though. [King Albert of Belgium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_I_of_Belgium) spent most of the first World War in the front-line trenches.

He was never wounded -- rumor had it that the Kaiser warned his troops not to harm him -- but he exposed himself to danger on a regular basis.

Winston Churchill - not yet prime minister, but a high ranking cabinet official [commanded a field unit for several months in 1916](http://hubpages.com/hub/Winston-Churchill-in-the-Trenches) ; but he was already a decorated veteran of the Sudan and Boer wars.

The future [King Boris III of Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_III_of_Bulgaria) was a serving officer from 1914 to 1918, while still a prince. He was mostly a staff officer, not a field commander, however, but apparently came under fire more than once.
