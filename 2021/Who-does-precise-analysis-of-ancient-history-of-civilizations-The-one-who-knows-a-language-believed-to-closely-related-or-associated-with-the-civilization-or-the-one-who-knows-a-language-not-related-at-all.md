Language learning can be critically important or simply a question of detail, depending on what you’re studying. Most scholars rely on translations provided by specialists unless the questions they are investigating depend on a close reading of a particular text. In those kinds of cases language familiarity — which is not the same thing as native fluency! — becomes essential.

A lot of historical texts don’t demand real language skills: a dictionary and some patience can get you pretty far in many kinds of research. For example here’s a text that doesn’t have a lot of nuance but has been important to scholars since it was first deciphered about sixty years ago:

My Linear B is — to say the least — pretty minimal but here’s what it says:

> rowers going to Pleuron
in Louwa 8 men
in Rion 5 men
in Pherai 4 men
Tetaranes 6 men
in Aponis(?) 6 men

Here’s a transcription that makes it easier to read:

It took took two truly gifted scholars — [Michael Ventris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ventris) and [John Chadwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chadwick) — to unravel the basics of this long-lost writing system. But somebody researching, say, naval history can sort through this with only a dictionary and some patience. Using this and similar documents, a naval historian could conclude (as they do) that a typical Mycenaean ship had a crew of about 30. A social historian could try to map the place names provided onto things like tax records from the same time to judge the prosperity and political importance of different towns in the region. Many historians build their entire careers on this kind of non-literary evidence; in fact they often prefer it because it’s less self-conscious and less prone to propagandizing than more interesting kinds of books.

Of course there are also places where language skills really are critical for understanding what’s going on.

A classic and widespread example is the way people who’s knowledge of Latin comes entirely through second-hand information on the internet treat something like this:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4ee8d59f82df943e6a0d606ab2be5533)

That’s an inscription of emperor Augustus, in which he proudly proclaims himself the son of the deified Julius Caesar; a casual stroll through the internet will uncover a lot of people who [think they’ve discovered a Dan-Brown style theological secret](https://sites.google.com/site/investigatingchristianity/home/caesar-and-christ) in the phrase _Divi filius augustus. “Augustus. Son of God”._ 

If, on the other hand, you know Latin well you’ll know that Latin lacks a definite article: Latin can’t express the difference between _a god_ and _the god_ and capital-G God. But in any case the word _divus_  ought not to be translated as “god.” It’s primarily used for deceased mortals of special virtue: Romulus, for example or in this case Julius Caesar. In fact, it’s quite commonly used in Medieval Latin for “deceased mortals of particular virtue”, that is, as the word for _saint_ .

This is definitely an area for specialists, not folks with just two years of school Latin. Roman religious terminology is bewildering, and the Romans often disagreed with each other in the shades of meaning in particular words

> The poet [Virgil] usually employs ‘of the _divi_ ‘ [_divum_ ] and ‘of the _dii_ ‘ [_deorum_ ] indifferently, although there should be a distinction in that we call the immortals _dii_ , whereas _divi_  are created from men, inasmuch as they have ended their days; from which we likewise call [dead] emperors _divi_ . But Varro and Ateius hold the opposite opinion, claiming that _divi_  are eternal, whereas _dii_  are such as are held in honour because they have been deified, such as is the case with the _dii manes_ .

[Servius, Ad Aeneam 5.45](https://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2009/06/25/divus-and-deus-in-varro-and-servius/)

There are also considerations of style as well as rigid dictionary definitions: Cicero, for example, was unduly proud of his knowledge of archaic Latin so he sometimes deliberately flips the usage of _divus_ and _deus_  when he’s trying to sound old-fashioned. This is a subject that you can’t study without both a solid grasp of the Latin language and enough reading in other Latin texts to know the shades of meaning that were floating around at a particular point in time.

All that said, it’s important to remember that language learning is a skill, it can be acquired. A talented scholar from can pick up a language that has no relationship to their native tongue: It was a Frenchman who[ deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphs](https://www.quora.com/How-were-the-Hieroglyphics-deciphered/answer/Steve-Theodore), a Russian who first [recovered the basics of the Mayan writing system,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Knorozov) and a trio consisting of an Englishman, an Irishman, and a French-German Jew who unraveled cuneiform ([unlocking several different languages, including several with no living descendants](https://www.quora.com/How-did-historians-learn-Sumerian-How-was-such-an-old-dead-language-decoded/answer/Steve-Theodore)).

It’s certainly true that language familiarity can be a leg up — but beyond a certain time horizon it’s not much help. [This is English](https://www.public.asu.edu/~gelderen/hel/orosius.html) from only about 1200 years ago — closer to us in time than Cleopatra was to King Tut.

> On þæm dagum wæs swa micel ege from ðæm wifmonnum, þætte Europe ne Asiam ne ealle þa neahþeoda ne mehton aþencean ne acræftan hu hi him wiðstondan mehten, ær þon hie gecuron Ercol þone ent þæt he hie sceolde mid eallum Creca cræftum beswican. þeah ne dorste he geneðan þæt he hie mid firde gefore, ær he ongan mid Creca scipun þe mon dulmunus hætt, þe mon sægð þæt on an scip mæge an þusend manna; þa nihtes on ungearwe hi on bestæl, hie swiþe forslog fordyde; hwæðere ne mehte hie þæs londes benæman.

You can treat þ and ð as something between “th” and “d”. If you give up, [there’s a translation at the bottom of page 72 of this link](https://opacplus.bsb-muenchen.de/Vta2/bsb10743826/bsb:BV020344776;jsessionid=D73339E571BFB73DF0D9AF388DDB5D0B.touch04?lang=en).
