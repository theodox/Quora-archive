Effectively, the number is infinite. They couldn’t do it.

Consider the fairest conceivable matchup, pitting the absolute pinnacle of sail-powered naval gunnery against the infancy of the armored warship: the [Battle of Hampton Roads ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hampton_Roads)where the Conferate ironclad _CSS Virginia_  confronted an entire Federal naval squadron.

The Virginia was a stripped down Union steam frigate (the former _USS Merrimack_ ) with armor made of 2″ of iron plate backed by two feet of wood and iron reinforcement. The Federal squadron was centered on two powerful frigates — the sailing ship _[USS Cumberland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cumberland_(1842))_ __ of 50 guns, and the steam powered _[USS Minnesota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Minnesota_(1855))_ __ of 44 — and the smaller sloop _[USS Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Congress_(1841)#American_Civil_War_service)_ __ of 52.

_a 10″ Dalhgren, with a crew of 20 (the older brass cannons only need a crew of 5)_ 

Those gun counts might not sound impressive compared to the “line of battle” ships from the Napoleonic era, but these ships were armed primarily with [Dahlgren “bottle” guns:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahlgren_gun#IX-inch) — unlike the old brass cannon of Nelsons’ day they were cast of iron with a well-designed breech that could stand massive powder charges. The heaviest gun on the old 100-gun [HMS Victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Victory) fired a 32 pound shell a bit over 1200 yards. The 10″ Dahlgrens on the _Minnesota_  fired a 128 pound shell more than 3,000 — in other words, the 1862 guns carried as much as 10 times more kinetic energy apiece. The _Minnesota_  and _Cumberland_  had about the same “broadside weight” as the old titan at three times her range. Moreover most of the guns at Hampton Roads were firing explosive shells, not just solid iron. This was the peak of sailing-ship armament.

Nevertheless, the battle was a rout.

The _Virginia_  rammed and sank the _Cumberland:_ she was able to shrug off broadsides at point blank range while her armored prow penetrated the wooden ship’s flank. The _Congress_  was set on fire and forced to strike her colors, and the _Minnesota_ grounded on a mud bank, unable to damage the Confederates’ metal monster. The Union lost two of its three ships, with almost 400 casualties. The _Virginia_  lost 2 men and had two guns damaged after an entire day under the guns of modern warships.

On the second day of Hampton Roads, the Union’s own armored warship — the [USS Monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Monitor) arrived, saving the Minnesota from certain destruction. The Monitor and the Virginia slugged it out for the second day at point blank range — but neither could seriously wound the other.

In short: the very best of sailing ship armament could not sink a steamship covered in low-quality iron plating. Later in the war, at [Mobile Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mobile_Bay), the lone Confederate ironclad__ _[CSS Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Tennessee_(1863))_ __ faced off against 14 wooden ships and four ironclads for three hours before she was battered into uselessness and surrendered. The only battle where sailing ships and ironclads clashed on anything like an equal footing was the [Battle of Lissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lissa_(1866)) in 1866. That was decided not by gunfire but by _ramming._ The gunnery of the 1860’s was simply not up to destroying armored warships so both navies resorted to more direct means of attack.

_Wooden ships and iron men: the Austrian wooden battleship_ Kaiser_rams the Italian ironclad_ Rei di Portogalla_. Despite the drama, both ships survived._ 

Now, fast forward to 1942 and the [USS Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa-class_battleship). _HMS Victory_  displaced 3,500 tons; the _SMS Kaiser_  which took on the ironclads at Lissa displaced 5,000. The _Iowa_  displaced 50,000. Her [belt armor](http://www.kbismarck.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2925) — the only armor that the flat-firing guns of a sailing ship could hit — was 11″ thick, but it wasn’t soft railroad iron: it was case hardened, laminated steel designed to withstand the impact of 2,700 pound armor piercing shell traveling 2,500 feet per second : something like 2,000 times the kinetic energy of a 10″ Dahlgren. Even at that, the impact resistance would hardly matter: the case-hardened armor plate would cause a 19th century shell to fracture, rather than explode so only a fraction of the energy would actually transfer to the target. The biggest danger to the crew of the Iowa would be fumes from paint set on fire by cannon fire.

_The German battle cruiser_ [SMS Seydlitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Seydlitz)_was hit by 21 shells and a torpedo -- about 45,000 pounds of high explosive, altogether — at the battle of Jutland. She survived and made it back to port under her own power, with the loss of less than a 100 out of her crew of 1000. She was half the size of Iowa._ 

To be fair a lot of modern warships would not be equally invulnerable - nowadays, we tend to [rely on speed and anti-air defences rather than armor](https://warshipphilosophy.wordpress.com/2013/05/28/modern-warship-armor-part-1/). Anti-missile missiles wont’t do much against a hail of cannonballs, and the quarter-inch steel of a modern destroyer hull isn’t much tougher than an SUV. 21st century American destroyers have been seriously damaged by a [suicide boat attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cole_bombing) and by a [collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Fitzgerald_and_MV_ACX_Crystal_collision) with a civilian vessel. They aren’t battleships.
