This is definitely in the “we’ll never know for sure” category.

The name does actually date back to the [hypothetical Trojan war](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-archeologists-think-that-the-Trojan-War-happened) period (dated some time in the 12th or 13th century BC): there’s an individual named _a-ki-re-u_  in a tablet from Knossos but he’s definitely not the warrior of legend, he’s a shepherd and probably a serf or slave.

There was a “tomb of Achilles” in the Troad, which was a popular tourist attraction in antiquity. However that doesn’t prove much : there are plenty of cases where a famous name gets attached to a monument of forgotten origin.

In general the oral tradition of the Iliad is a distorting mirror — it has surprising bits of deep history mixed with fictions and confusions. Homer seems to have gotten at least two other proper name right, since we’ve found Hittite records of a ruler named [Alaksandu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaksandu) — that is, the alternate name Homer gives for Paris — was ruler of [Wilusa,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilusa) (Homer’s _Ilios )_ somwhere in northwestern Turkey.

_This_ _[Hittite tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawagalawa_letter)_ _refers to an attack by the_ Ahhiwaya _(assumed to be Homer’s “Achaeans”) on_ Wilusa _(Homer’s Ilios)_ 

But these correspondences are no guarantee of literal accuracy The poems preserve without understanding bits and pieces of Mycenaean context , which was at least four centuries gone when the poems took their familiar form. There are chariots, but the aren’t used in logical ways; there are bronze weapons, but the workers have iron tools; there is even writing, but it’s an inexplicable act of magic instead of the obsessive bureaucratic record-keeping of Mycenaean times. Four centuries is a long time for an oral tradition to mutate its subject matter in subtle and not so subtle ways. Consider — as an example — the school of thought that holds the “wooden horse” is just a mythologized, distorted version of a typical near-eastern battering ram or siege tower as repeated by illiterate Greeks who hand’t seen one in four centuries.

_The wooden horse? This Assyrian siege engine , filtered through four centuries of oral transmission, could be the origin of the famous horse._ 

If I had to bet, I’d say that there probably was an individual Mycenaean warlord named Achilles who made a name for himself and achieved a certain immortality through the oral tradition. But I doubt the Achilles of the poem shares much more with him than a name.
