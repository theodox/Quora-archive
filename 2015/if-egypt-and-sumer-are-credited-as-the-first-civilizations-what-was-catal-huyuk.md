This gets down to one of those definitional arguments: when do you transition from a 'village' to a 'town' to a 'city' to a 'civilization' ? There are a number of competing definitions: an archaeologist, an anthropologist, an economist and a political scientist may all have very different definitions which make sense for their particular goals or the questions they are trying to answer.

Çatalhöyük is one of several large permanent settlements which have been found that appear to date to between 9 and 10 thousand years ago. Other examples include [Jericho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho) and [Khirokitia. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khirokitia)These all show some important differences from older settlements -- they clearly indicate long term habitation over many generations, permanent structures, and enough social organization to support specialists -- people who were builders, potters, weavers... not just hunters or gatherers. If your definition of civilization one of the ones which is limited to 'permanent habitation and division of labor' they make good candidates for the title of first civilization....although then there are all the complex technicalities involved in firm dating for settlements that old.

_Jericho_   

For some purposes though it's useful to distinguish a civilization as a network of settlements rather than as a settled mode of life. [Eridu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eridu) is a settlement but it's also the first clear evidence of the [Sumerian civilization: ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer)the network of settlements, economic ties, and cultural features which bound ancient Mesopotamia together starting around 7,500 years ago. Compared to a settlement, Sumeria (or ancient Egypt or the [Indus Valley civilisation ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilisation)show a few important extra features. 

The most obvious thing is__size__ : these are all complexes which include many settlements over a broad geographical area. 

They also feature __economic specialization__ on a larger level: all of these candidates include settlements which are not truly self sufficient but instead survive by trading some local product for necessities from far away: you could oversimplify to say that a settlement like Çatalhöyük or Jericho has specialist individuals, whereas Sumer or Egypt includes specialist towns or cities.

_Sumerian cities (black dots) participated in a complex, multi-sided trade network_  

Lastly, a unit like Sumer or Egypt includes __shared cultural institutions__  between settlements. Sumerian and Egyptian cities have shared religious, cultural and economic practices which bind them together. While its possible that Jericho or Çatalhöyük shared languages, worship or units of measure with (as yet undiscovered) neighbors we don't know that for sure. 

So: if you're interested in using 'civilization' to distinguish permanent settlement and specialization from the semi-nomadic lifestyle of most hunter-gatherers Çatalhöyük is a good candidate for the title of 'first civilization' -- but if you're interested in placing different cultures on a scale that indicates how complex they were it's not, barring further discoveries.
