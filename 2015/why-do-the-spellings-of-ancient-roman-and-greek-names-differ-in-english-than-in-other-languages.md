# Why do the spellings of ancient Roman and Greek names differ in English than in other languages?

In addition to the root word issue, many Greek words entered into English (or other modern languages) via Latin translation. Herakles is the original Greek, Hercules is the Latin translation of that and it entered into English that way. 

You can usually recognize modern transliterations directly from Greek because they use k- and kh- where the Greeks used kappa and chi, i for iota, and preserve the -os ending, while older Latin-based transliterations use c-, ch-, i and -us. 

Greek Latinate
Kleon Cleon
Khimaira Chimera
Alkibiades Alcibiades 
Akhilleos Achilles
Dionysos Dionysus
Herakles Hercules

But even authors who prefer the modern, more accurate translation often keep the well known traditional names (like Achilles or Hercules). The result is often a mess.
