If you’re thinking of Greeks in the Mediterranean world — not those [who lived in India or Afghanistan ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek_Kingdom)— probably the best candidate is Σαρμανες, _Sarmanes,_ which first appears in the (fragmentary) work of [Megasthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megasthenes), a Greek writer who was an ambassador at the court of Chandragupta Maurya. Megasthenes divides Indian philosophers into _Brachmanes_  and _Sarmanes_  — the former are recognizably Brahmans, and his description of the latter seems to include all sorts of ascetics, not just Buddhists. Its seems to be his effort to render _Śramaṇa_  into Greek, and that would at the time would have been used for Buddhists but also for Jains and other sects; [his description preserved in Strabo](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D15#note-link93) seems to combine elements of Buddhist practice with other Indian ascetic traditions.*

Megasthenes also calls the subset of his Sarmanes which most closely resembles Buddhists θερᾰπευται, _therapeutai —_ a word usually translated as “healers” or “helpers”, but which to Greek ears also had the connotation of something like a religious order (the Jewish writer Philo described an ascetic subset of his co-religionists as _therapeutai_  to his Greek readers).

As that example suggests, there might not really be a single proper noun that fits the bill. It appears from Greek versions of Buddhist material in Bactria and the Indo-Greek kingdom that the preferred translations of Buddhist ideas used standard Greek terms for Buddhist concepts: for example the [Greek inscriptions of Ashoka](http://www.ancient.eu/image/259/) use εὐσέβεια, “piety” or “virtue” where Ashoka means Dharma, so it’s not unlikely that generic words like therapeutai and “philosophers” would have been what Greeks used by preference. However in the same edict Ashoka encourages “Bramanes, Sarmanes, and others” to “keep in mind the interests of the king” — ie, not to get too overheated — when debating εὐσέβεια. It’s not clear from the context if Ashoka uses _Sarmanes_  as “ascetics” or “Buddhists” here.

The name “Buddha” itself does not show up in Greek until quite late; the first citation is from the church father [Clement of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_of_Alexandria) some time around the year 200. He wrote

> Among the Indians are those philosophers also who follow the precepts of Boutta (Βούττα) , whom they honour as a god on account of his extraordinary sanctity.

You’ll note that he uses the generic “philosophers” in preference to a name. Clement also recycles a bit of Megasthenes about the Sarmanes a few lines before this, so it’s clear that he wasn’t assuming the term was limited only to Buddhists. As an Alexandrian there’s a fair chance that Clement met the occasional Indian in person, since he lived near the peak of [the sea-trade between Roman Egypt and India](https://www.quora.com/I-have-heard-that-ancient-Greece-and-Rome-were-having-trades-with-south-Indian-kingdoms-But-in-history-why-werent-these-given-much-importance-and-not-talked-about).

A different spelling shows up on this coin of Kushan emperor Kanishka from about 150: ΒΟΔΔΟ, _Boddo._ The Kushans ruled over the former Greek cities of Bactria (home of the [Gandhara Greco-Buddhist art tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhist_art))

There are also some Bactrian manuscripts in Greek characters — [damned hard to find on the internet, I might add](http://www.indologie.uni-muenchen.de/dokumente/publ_hartmann/exhibition_catalogue.pdf) — which also use Βοδδο, sometimes jammed together with long Buddhist titles like λωγοασφαροραζοβοδδο for “Lokesvararaja Buddha" However it’s not entirely clearly that any Greek (rather than Kushan or Bactrian) speaker ever used Βοδδο.



* Note in the linked version it’s “Garamanes” with a “G.” Some copyist in the middle ages mistook an Cyrillic-style C-sigma for a G.
