You’re probably thinking of [Agathocles of Bactria](http://coinindia.com/galleries-agathocles.html), one of the rulers of the [Greco-Bactrian Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom), which occupied an area bounded by Persia on the west, the Indus on the East, and the Syr Darya on the north — essentially Afghanistan and the northern half of Pakistan.

The Greco-Bactrian rulers had many subjects whose primary cultural orientation was towards the subcontinent. Several Greco-Bactrian kings patronized Buddhism — in fact, king [Menander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menander_I#:~:text=Menander%20I%20Soter%20(Ancient%20Greek,Subcontinent%20from%20his%20capital%20at) went on to a prosperous afterlife as the enlightened Milinda of the [Milinda Panha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milinda_Panha) , as far as I know the only Greek who ended up in Buddhist Scriptures.

Agathocles issued a lot of traditional Greek coins:

However he and his predecessor [Pantaleon](https://www.geni.com/people/Pantaleon-Subking-of-Bactria-King-of-Bactria-and-India/6000000011800090502) both also issued Indian-style coins as well, which at that time were quite disinct:

Experts disagree on how to identify the figures on the Indian-style Bactrian coins but the ones below are are often identified as [Vāsudeva-Krishna ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%81sudeva)(left) and [Saṃkarṣaṇa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83kar%E1%B9%A3a%E1%B9%87a) (right).

It’s been suggested that Vāsudeva-Krishna was seen by Indo-Greeks as a local version of Herakles, following the common Greek habit of seeing foreign gods with martial attributes as “Herakles under another name.” Many Hellenistic era kings used Herakles as a symbol of kingship, so the image could do double duty.
