Probably not

'Classical' - that is, say, 150BC to 100 AD - Latin the word order can be pretty torturous; since Latin grammar is based on endings rather than position in the sentence its pretty common for a sentence to develop slowly through a ton of dependent clauses with a long separation between subject and verb: This bit from Caesar's Gallic Wars (2.25) is the all-time winner for most ridiculous run-on Latin, but it's a surprisingly crowded field (subjects and verbs in __bold).__ 



>  __Caesar__ ab X legionis cohortatione ad dextrum cornu profectus, ubi suos urgeri signisque in unum locum conlatis XII legionis confertos milites sibi ipsos ad pugnam esse impedimento vidit, quartae cohortis omnibus centurionibus occisis signiferoque interfecto, signo amisso, reliquarum cohortium omnibus fere centurionibus aut vulneratis aut occisis, in his primipilo P. Sextio Baculo, fortissimo viro, multis gravibusque vulneribus confecto, ut iam se sustinere non posset, reliquos esse tardiores et non nullos ab novissimis deserto loco proelio excedere ac tela vitare, hostes neque a fronte ex inferiore loco subeuntes intermittere et ab utroque latere instare et rem esse in angusto vidit, neque ullum esse subsidium quod submitti posset, 2 scuto ab novissimis [uni] militi detracto, quod ipse eo sine scuto venerat, in primam aciem __processit__ centurionibusque nominatim appellatis reliquos cohortatus milites signa inferre et manipulos laxare __iussit__ , quo facilius gladiis uti possent.




> __Caesar__ proceeded, after encouraging the tenth legion, to the right wing; where he perceived that his men were hard pressed, and that in consequence of the standards of the twelfth legion being collected together in one place, the crowded soldiers were a hindrance to themselves in the fight; that all the centurions of the fourth cohort were slain, and the standard-bearer killed, the standard itself lost, almost all the centurions of the other cohorts either wounded or slain, and among them the chief centurion of the legion P. Sextius Baculus, a very valiant man, who was so exhausted by many and severe wounds, that he was already unable to support himself; he likewise perceived that the rest were slackening their efforts, and that some, deserted by those in the rear, were retiring from the battle and avoiding the weapons; that the enemy [on the other hand] though advancing from the lower ground, were not relaxing in front, and were [at the same time] pressing hard on both flanks; he also perceived that the affair was at a crisis, and that there was not any reserve which could be brought up, having therefore snatched a shield from one of the soldiers in the rear (for he himself had come without a shield), he __advanced__ to the front of the line, __and__ addressing the centurions by name, and encouraging the rest of the soldiers, he __ordered__ them to carry forward the standards, and extend the companies, that they might the more easily use their swords. 


One sentence! And not very good for the TV audience.

So, to answer the original question a bit more succinctly: I don't think so. I think the writing is trying to sound "archaic" in a generic Hollywood way (Almost nobody uses [hortatory subjunctive](http://classics.uchicago.edu/files/mayandmight.pdf) "Let XXX be YYYY" anymore outside of Sunday school or math class).
