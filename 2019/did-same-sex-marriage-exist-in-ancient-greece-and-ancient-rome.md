Not really. There’s plenty of examples of same-sex cohabitation (though almost all of them are male-male), and a few cases of people who were rich or powerful enough to live any way they felt like: probably the most famous example were the two marriages of Roman emperor Nero to [Pythagoras ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_(freedman))and [Sporus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporus). However there was no legal recognition of same sex unions.

Marriage was fundamentally regarded as an instrument for the transmission of familial property : it had very little to do with love or romance or personal fulfillment. A Greek and Roman man who preferred men in his private life was nevertheless expected to marry a woman in order to father children; failure to do so was regarded as a failure of your fundamental social obligations. Ancestor worship was an important part of both Greek and Roman tradition; failing to produce heirs who would carry on the line and ensure that the family rites were maintained in the family shrines was tantamount to betrayal. But that had nothing to to with personal feelings — it was more like allowing the family home to fall down for lack of repair: it was dereliction of duty.

The other dimension is the fact that both free Greek and Roman men were strongly discouraged from adopting what was seen as a “woman’s” role in a relationship. Most of the socially-approved homosexual sex in antiquity was not between social equals: more often than not one of the partners was an adolescent or slave — or often both. A free man who was suspected of playing the subordinate role in a same-sex relationship faced social ostracism. Almost by definition _one_ of the partners in a relationship between free social equals would have to be playing a part seen as degrading.

To a small degree adoption played a role you could analogize to civil unions in the modern parlance: the wealthier partner of a pair could “adopt” a “son” as a way of sharing property and ensuring that after one partner died the other could retain a home and a lifestyle.
