It’s fairly unlikely. The first Latin translation we know of is [Leonardo Bruni’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Bruni) version from 1405; he probably got the Greek manuscript from [Manuel Chrysoloras,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Chrysoloras) who was his Greek teacher.

For the 12th c., one could imagine a transmission via Sicily. The court of [Frederick II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) was multilingual, and Sicily still had a native Greek population although it was entering a period of steep decline. Translations of the _Meno_ and the _Phaedo_ were made in Catania around this time, though they did not circulate widely and have been lost.

Overall, though, Plato was not a popular subject in the western Mediterranean at this point. Christian, Jewish and Muslim scholars in Spain all shared an abiding interest in Aristotle, but Plato didn’t attract the same level of attention — and more importantly, of translation. A lot of Jewish and Arabic references to Plato come via commentators or Neoplatonists, not directly from the original works. The only Platonic dialogue that was widely available in Latin in the 1100’s was the _[Timaeus](https://www.library.illinois.edu/rbx/exhibitions/Plato/Pages/Translations.html)_ , which is pretty different than the rest of the Platonic corpus and was popular as a “scientific” rather than a philosophical work. Only in Byzantium were the rest of the Platonic dialogues easily accessible.

The likeliest way a French reader in the 12th c. would pick up a theme from the Gorgias is via [Boethius](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/boethius/); the _Consolation of Philosophy_  was very widely read and borrows arguments from the Gorgias.
