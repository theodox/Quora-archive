There is a lot of scholarly work in this field, though not all of it is in English and it's not collated into a single resource. The closest thing I could come up with is [The Magistrates of the Roman Republic](http://amzn.to/1ewCcj8), by [T.R.S. Broughton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Shannon_Broughton) .
It's not available online AFAIK but it looks like there is somebody trying to: [digitize it](http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/236C3448-4806-4FF3-8E01-DAD9B4FA8E31).

Here are couple of collections of related material. This was a hot scholarly topic from the 30's through the 70's but is less fashionable nowadays so the bulk of the material is in print rather than online. 

[Prosopography Portal](http://prosopography.modhist.ox.ac.uk/bibliography.htm)
[Prosopography - Classics - Oxford Bibliographies - obo](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195389661/obo-9780195389661-0077.xml#obo-9780195389661-0077-div1-0005)

Other big names in the field are _[Ronald Syme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Syme)_  and [Ernst Badian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Badian). 

For the empire proper there's the [Prosopographia imperii romani saec I. II. III. ](https://archive.org/details/prosopographiai00dessgoog) and the Dominate there's [The prosopography of the later Roman Empire. 2. A. D. 395 - 527](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_prosopography_of_the_later_Roman_Emp.html?id=G5W6vCO_pYUC)

Wiki also has a [List of Roman gentes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_gentes) but it's not organized by time so it includes everybody, and many of the names are stubbed.
