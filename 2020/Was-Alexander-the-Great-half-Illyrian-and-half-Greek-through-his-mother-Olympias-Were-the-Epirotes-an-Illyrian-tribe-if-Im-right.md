# Was Alexander the Great half-Illyrian and half-Greek (through his mother, Olympias)? Were the Epirotes an Illyrian tribe, if I'm right?

The Epirotes were Greek, though with a few qualifications.

Olympias’ family claimed, anyway, to be descendants of Achilles, via his son Neoptolemus (more on that [here](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-the-Great-decide-to-look-up-to-Achilles-instead-of-Heracles-He-could-trace-lineage-to-both-and-both-could-be-seen-as-conquerors-of-the-East-Was-Heracles-not-seen-as-a-greater-hero-and-someone-you/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=537a0900&srid=zLvM)). The oracle of [Dodona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodona), one of the oldest and most important Hellenic religious sites (probably #3, after Delphi and Olmpia) was in Epirus. Many modern linguists think that Epirus was the historic cradle of the Greek language (though, like many topics in pre-historic Greece, this is hotly debated). Epirote Greek was a northwest Greek dialect related to Macedonian Greek and the Greek spoken in Thessaly. And perhaps most relevant here, Alexander’s great-grandfather [Tharrhypas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tharrhypas) is frequently credited with the introduction of southern Greek institutions and mores into Epirus — whatever the family tree looked like, Olympias’ family would have told you they were Greek. Her uncle [Arybbas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arybbas_of_Epirus) was an Olympic victor, so he was as close to “officially” Greek as you can get despite his non-Greek name.

That said, there’s plenty of ways to complicate the picture.

Thucydides, for example, describes the [Chaonians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaonians)— one of the main Epirote tribes — as “barbarians.” There are a sprinkling of non-Greek names among the handful that come down to us: names like Sabylinthus or, in Olympias’ family Arrybas and Tharrypas, which aren’t Greek. However, these names also don’t seem to fit into recognizable Illyrian patterns _either_ — they reflect a level of linguistic diversity which our written sources (all in Greek, of course) tend to hide. Mountainous territory, often inhabited by mobile pastoralists, is a fertile ground for microcultures, one of the reasons the Balkans has always had so many smaller language groups operating in the interstices of the bigger clusters. In the case of Epirus, it’s clear that the shrine was an international magnet — worshipers came from the rest of Greece but also from Illyria and Thrace and Greek-influenced southern Italy. This suggests not just tourists, but rather a diffusion of cultures flowing easily across the lines on modern map. And — given the Epirotes’ reputation for “barbaric” ways even if they were descendants of Achilles — that diffusion seems to flow in more than one direction.

In short, it’s probably better not to think about this region as a neatly delimited, well defined society inhabited by a homogeneous population. The royal family was an active participant in the Greek world for at least a century before Alexander was born. Farther down the social scale its hard to tell — but there is almost certainly more, rather than less variety of language and origin. It’s a messy region.

As far as Alexander’s personal history goes, there’s also the fact that Epirotes — at least, Epirote royalty — practiced polygamy when it suited their fancy (the most famous example is [Pyrrhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus), whose Greek wife [Lanassa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanassa_(wife_of_Pyrrhus)) left him in disgust after he brought home a second, Illyrian, bride).

Since we don’t know how common this was (and our Epirote royal genealogies get fuzzy in the mid-5th century BC) it’s not really possible to put any kind of numbers on the various admixtures. For comparison purposes, two of Philip II’s seven wives were non-Greek.* In the specific case of Alexander, Olympias’ male ancestors have mix of Greek and unplaceable names (3 to 2). The two named female ancestors are Troas (who was an Epirote royal) and Phthia, a Greek woman from Thessaly.

__EDIT__ 

I thought I’d add this bit, from the Gallo-Roman historian [Trogus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnaeus_Pompeius_Trogus), since it’s a good illustration of the complexity of Epirote ancestry. As a late source it’s not super reliable but it does illustrate an ancient view of how non-homogeneous Epirus was:

> The first regal power in this country was that of the Molossi. Afterwards Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, having been deprived of his father’s dominions during his absence in the Trojan war, settled in these parts; the inhabitants of which were first called Pyrrhidae, and afterwards Epirots. This Pyrrhus, going to the temple of Jupiter at Dodona to consult the oracle, seized there by force Lanassa, the granddaughter of Hercules, and by a marriage with her had eight children. Of his daughters he gave some in marriage to the neighbouring princes, and by means of these alliances acquired great power. He gave to Helenus, the son of King Priam, for his eminent services, the kingdom of the Chaonians, and Andromache the widow of Hector in marriage, after she had been his own wife, he having received her at the division of the Trojan spoil. Shortly after he was slain at Delphi, at the very altar of Apollo, by the treachery of Orestes the son of Agamemnon. His successor was his son Pielos

[XVII.3](https://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/english/trans17.html)

If you follow this it makes the Chaonians descendants of both Achilles _and_  Priam, and it implies that the Aeacid dynasty (a) had Trojan blood, (b) practiced polygamy from early on and (c) intermarried with local elites.

FWIW, Modern historians don’t believe the derivation of “Epirus” from “Pyrrhus”.
