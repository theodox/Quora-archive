_Self-sustained_  is possible, but it’s _hard. Relaxed_ is highly unlikely.

Games is a creative field, like music or painting — like both of those, it’s satisfying and has an aura that a lot of people want to wrap themselves in. And, like both music and visual arts games is hard to make a living at.

There are so many people who want to make games that you’ll have a lot of competition: if you’re content to make $20,000 and price your product accordingly, there will be somebody who’s even more eager to be in games down the road or across the planet who thinks they can get by on $19.000. Or $10,000. Or maybe they don’t want money, they just want internet fame. Regardless, they mere existence of all those other folks make puts downward pressure on what you can expect to sell your game for. A gamer today can play two or three new games every single day without ever spending a dime, between F2p and demos and free community projects. So selling games for money is a tough, tough business for most people — just like rapping or sculpting or playing classical violin.

That’s where ‘relaxed’ comes in. If you’re going to survive in a crowded, competitive field like games you have to be pretty canny. You might get lucky but if you don’t $20,000 may seem like a lot more. The last year I know the numbers for (2014) the Game Developer Salary Survey put the average indie game developer’s earnings at $11,000. If you’re going to really support your self in games for more than a year or two, you’ll need to be smart about more than just development: you’ll need to learn how to do marketing, how to budget for outsourcing, how to handle the complexities of taxes, how to manage your online community, and how to keep going if you miss your release schedule. There are plenty of folks who do it —- but many, many more who can’t manage all of those jobs at once. I always point indies at Dan Cooks invaluable article [Minimum Sustainable Success](http://www.lostgarden.com/2015/04/minimum-sustainable-success.html), which is s great example of how a smart indie developer approaches these kinds of problems.

Short answer: indie development is exhilarating, its fun, its cool. It’s not very well paid. And its definitely not relaxed.
