If you've never read [I Claudius](http://smile.amazon.com/Claudius-Autobiography-Tiberius-Murdered-International/dp/067972477X/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_1968490442?_encoding=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0&pf_rd_p=1968490442&pf_rd_s=smile-campaign&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=067972477X&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=184TD4F0XYBQBJX1E7BK), it's a very detailed (imaginary!) recreation of this period. We don't have good, unbiased sources - I'm not sure that such a thing is possible for this kind of intimate information at any rate - but Graves was a fervent student of the source material ([Suetonius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/home.html) and [Tacitus](http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/annals.1.i.html) are the most accessible) and his guesses are well informed, albeit fictionalized. Don't take it for history but it is worth reading!
