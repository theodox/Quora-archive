_Original Question: Why was there no reference to Judaism before the time of Ezra the Scribe?_ 

Unless you’re working on some highly-specific (not to say “deliberately misleading”) definition of Judaism, there’s significant earlier evidence.

Later Jewish tradition credits Ezra with the creation of the [Great Synagogue](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-great-assembly). That, in turn, is broadly understood as the institutional bedrock of later Judaic. In that specific sense you could say “Judaism” really does start with Ezra. However, if you’re simply using “Judaism” to mean “the religious tradition of the people of Judah” then clearly Ezra is just one way-point on a long continuum that goes back centuries before him. Certainly, the implication that he just showed up and conjured the whole thing out of thin air is incorrect.

Traditionally Ezra was a member of the exilic Jewish community in Babylon. That community leaves archaeological traces for more than a century before the usual dates assigned to Ezra; for example, the rations accorded provided for the exiled king [Jehoiacim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeconiah) (see [1 Esdras 43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Esdras%201&version=NRSV)) “Ya’u-kīnu of the land of _Yāhudu_ ” survive on a fragmentary tablet from Nebuchudnezzar’s archives. This would be some time around 590 BCE, over a century before Ezra’s career (other archaeology relating to the exilic period in [this answer](https://archaeologyunearthed.quora.com/What-archaeological-evidence-do-we-have-for-the-Judean-exiles-in-Babylonia-in-the-6th-century-BCE-after-the-destructio-2)).

There’s also abundant archaeological evidence for the presence of the Jewish states going back at least as far as things like the [Tel Dan stele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Dan_stele) (relating to Judah) and the [Mesha stele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesha_Stele) (relating to Israel) in the 9th c BCE. There’s dispute about how to read the[ “House of David” stele ](https://www.imj.org.il/en/collections/371407)but if it really is a reference to the Davidic monarchy then that belief, too, is attested for the 9th century. Closer to Ezra, but still centuries in his past, we have a [seal from king Hezekiah](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/12/151202132519.htm) (some time close to 727 BCE).

We don’t know, however, how similar the Israelites of those earlier periods were to their descendants of later times in theological or social terms — we can certainly see communities of Jews in the Persian era (roughly contemporary with Ezra, actually) [whose practices seem rather different than those that eventually became the Jewish mainstream](https://www.encyclopedia.com/places/africa/egyptian-political-geography/elephantine).

On the other hand there’s plenty of evidence for theophoric names based on Yahweh (Hezekiah is “Yahweh strengthens”, Ahaziah from the Tel Dan stele is “Yah[weh] holds”) as far afield as Egypt and Babylon and some centuries before Ezra: his name, in fact, is probably a contraction of Azaryah, “Yah helps”. In any case, the [Ketef Hinnom scrolls](https://www.imj.org.il/en/collections/198069) which date from before the Babylonian exile contain references to Yahweh and to “the covenant” and “commandments” which strongly suggests that something similar to familiar Judaism was already present in Israel. They contain a formula (“The Lord bless and protect you. The Lord deal kindly and graciously with you. The Lord bestow his favor upon you and grant you peace.” ) which is still used in Jewish liturgies.

So, Ezra-era Yahwism might not be the familiar Judaism of the later times — but it’s not a sudden invention either. After all, the whole story about Ezra reading aloud from the book of the law to the assembled multitudes doesn’t make a lot of sense if the crowd didn’t accept on some level that what he was reading was supposed to be authoritative — if you’ve never heard of Moses, why would “a scribe skilled in the law of Moses” draw a crowd?
