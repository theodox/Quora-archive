As far as I know γλῶττα just means 'a tongue' , that is, 'a language' : just as in English the organ and the medium use the same word. 

κοινὴ literally means 'common', and it's a reference to the phrase ἡ κοινὴ διάλεκτος, 'the common dialect'. 

It really means two different kinds of 'common' : In one senses it reflects the speech that evolved in the the Hellenic diaspora which damped down the very strong regional differences in classical Greek (γλῶττα for example would be γλῶσσα if you were a Spartan or a Thessalian and γλάσσα in Miletus)

In another sense it reflects the simpler, less grammatically elaborate style of speaking and writing which resulted from the use of Greek as a common language of trade and statecraft in the eastern Mediterranean generally. That's the sense in which, say, the New Testament is κοινὴ: its Greek spoken and written by people who weren't Greek by upbringing.
