The Numidians were among the ancestors of modern Berbers. By the time of their incorporation into the Roman military they had been living side-by-side with the Cathaginians for several centuries and there was a lot of intermixing in both directions (so, for example., the Numidian royal family included very native names like [Masinissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masinissa) or [Syphax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphax) but also very Carthaginian names like [Adherbal ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adherbal_(king_of_Numidia))and Mastanabal.

The ancient sources don’t give ‘color’ information, but it’s worth noting that they usually distinguished ‘Libya’ — basically, Africa west of Egypt and north of the Sahara — from ‘Aethiopia’ — which was inhabited peoples they thought of as darker-skinned.

Here’s some picture reference:

_[Juba I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_I_of_Numidia)_ _, a particularly unlucky king of Numidia who did, however, get his portrait done while on a visit to Rome. Julius Caesar once pulled his beard._

[Juba II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II) (ⵢⵓⴱⴰ in Berber) was raised in Rome, and was famous for his scholarly pursuits — he wrote natural histories in Greek which circulated widely, and sent an expedition to the Canary Islands. He also married the daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra.

[Masinissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masinissa) (ⵎⵙⵏⵙⵏ in Berber) made a timely alliance with the Romans against Carthage, and became the founder of the Numidian kingdom. This is probably done a hundred years or more after his death.

[Jugurtha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugurtha), another unlucky Numidian king, was defeated by Marius. I’m not convinced that this image is really him, however: the coin is so similar to the one below — which is usually identified as Hannibal’s father the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal. This could reflect the degree of intermarriage between Numidian and Carthaginian elites… or somebody re-using old coin dies… or perhaps that’s a conventional image of [Melqart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melqart) and not either leader at all.

It’s not clear if Emperor [Septimius Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus) was actually of Numidian descent (top right). He was born in Leptis Magna (in modern Libya). His first language was Punic, rather than Latin; like most of the local upper classes of Roman Africa his ancestors probably included both Carthaginians and Numidians (though his mother was Italian). While he was emperor he pushed the Roman frontier deep into the Sahara, reaching [Germa](http://www.lexicorient.com/libya/germa.htm)
