Carthage was settled by Phoenicians, but was politically independent from the beginning. Like Greek settlements in Sicily and southern Italy, the colonists maintained social, religious and family ties with the mother country -- but (like the US and Great Britain) they evolved in different directions. It's not uncommon for colonies to reflect the state of the parent culture at the time of their founding: Quebecois French, for example, seems archaic to many other French speakers. 

Phoenicia was subject to a lot of outside powers, falling under the power of first Assyria then Babylon, Persia and finally the Selucids. Carthage remained independent down its destruction by Rome, so it's culture was in some ways 'purer' than that of the Levantine version. Punic declined in its homeland as Aramaic and later Greek became the languages of commerce, while it remained vital in Carthage. Carthage was less thoroughly Hellenized than the homeland since it was never conquered by Greeks; this meant that many practices which fell out of favor at home (notably infant sacrifice) continued in Carthage after being abandoned in Phoenicia proper. 

Trade, cultural and family ties remained strong (even as late as the Roman period -- the Severan dynasty of emperors originated in Carthage, but had family ties to Syria). It's likely that there was plenty of movement back and forth -- we know that many Greek colonies continued to preserve family relationships with their home cities for several centuries after their founding and it's reasonable to assume that the same was true for Carthage. However the movement of people in antiquity was very slow: natural increase and the assimilation of the local Numidian and Libyan populations would have accounted for far more Carthaginians than continued emigration from Lebanon.
