No, the last person to rule both halves under the official, post-Diocletian division was [Theodosius I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I) .

You could also make a case for [Irene of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_of_Athens), or (if you took a very different view of the legalities, for Charlemagne). Justinian’s reconquest of most of Italy, much of North Africa, Sicily and parts of Spain could be arguably a ‘reunification’ of the empire under a single head. The Byzantines held on to those western territories from the 6th to the 9th century (and for a short time Syracuse was actually the capital of the Roman Empire!) . There was also a flimsy legal foundation for the reunification: then Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus he officially took the title of ‘king of Italy’ rather than emperor, offering a meaningless but polite submission to [Zeno ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_(emperor))as the sole emperor. So both on practical and nominal grounds the Byzantine emperors retained at least theoretical sovereignty over the west.

The final, irrevocable split between east and west was the coronation of Charlemagne, which permanently established two rival empires with a hazy notion of kinship but no pretense of political unity. There are some who read the coronation as a claim on the sovereignty of the whole, undivided empire and not on the west alone.

The byzantine empire still owned a good bit of the west in 600 (top) and retains a good bit of Italy through the 700’s (bottom). Byzantine toehold in the west lasted into the 10th century.
