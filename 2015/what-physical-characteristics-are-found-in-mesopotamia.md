If you're referring to the physical characteristics of Mesopotamians, there isn't really a single ethnic type: the region has very open borders and lots of different peoples settled there over the last 7,000 years. Modern scholarship tends to emphasize the diversity and multi-ethnic makeup of groups that used to be described as 'races' or 'nations' because they shared languages or cultural characteristics.

 Here are some of the big groupings in historical Mesopotamia:

[Sumerians](http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/cultures/middle_east/sumerians.aspx) (as the other answer notes) were dark haired, and statuary makes them appear to have wavy hair though it's hard to tell how much that's a convention. Sumerian art is not hyper realistic so apart from the name ("dark haired people",) it's tough to get much detail:

(evidently Sumerian priests shaved their heads). I have a dim recollection that they are believed to be shorter than their Mesopotamian neighbors and rivals, but I'm can't recall the source.

There were a number of Semitic groups, including the ancestors of todays Arabs, who lived in Mesopotamia. Akkadian, which succeeded Sumerian as the most common written language, is a Semitic language related to Arabic and Hebrew. The Babylonians and Assyrians spoke dialects of the Akkadian family, but it's not clear to what degree that makes them physically related. We have lots of detailed art for Assyrians:

which might remind a modern viewer of Arabs or Sephardi Jews. Babylonian art is less exaggerated but suggest similar features:

The [Assyrians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_peopleof) of modern Iraq claim to be the direct descendants of the ancient "Chaldeans", the Semitic inhabitants of central Mesopotamia. It's hard to know how much centuries of Arab, Persian and Turkish domination may have done to their looks, however. 

The [Elamites](http://www.ancient.eu/elam/) lived to the east and southeast of Mesopotamia and spoke an unrelated language. They may be related to the [Dravidian peoples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_peoples) of India but there's not much clear evidence; and nowadays the assumption that all Dravidians look like South Indians is also contested. 

The [Hittites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittites) spoke an Indo-European language, distantly related to Greek, Persian and Sanskrit. They are usually described as fair skinned and fair haired, but how much of that is based on the presumed association of the language family with "Aryan" looks is unclear. The _[Mitanni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitanni)_ __  are another Indo-European group with the same questions. Here's a Egyptian portrait of a Hittite prisoner (Egyptian artists tend to exaggerate the physical characteristics of foreigners):

The [Hurrians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurriansand) lived around the region of modern Armenia, but it's not clear to whom they might be related. 

Finally the Persians and Medes, who came around fairly late ( after 1000 BC) who are the ancestors of modern Iranians. Their homelands were north and east of mesopotamia but they ruled over the region from the time of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great.
