Conventionally, Charon gets an obol (known, unsurprisingly, as [Charon's obol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon%27s_obol)). An obol is an everyday coin worth about the same as a loaf of bread. In higher-status burials, more elaborate substitutes were sometimes used as well.

In Aristophanes’ _[Frogs](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristophanes/frogs.html)_ , when Dionysus dresses up as Heracles in order to go to the underworld and recover a great tragic poet for the sadly diminished Athenian theater festival, the passage is supposed to be _two_ obols. It’s not clear if that reflects wartime inflation — the play was put on during the Peloponessian war, when Athens was under siege — or if the playwright is just counting the fee for Dionysus and his slave Xanthias. In general, though, a single obol was the ordinary fee.
