Koine is kind of a simplified, genericized melding of the various classical Greek dialects. Almost anybody literate in any form of Greek could figure it out: _koine_ was basically the ancient equivalent of [English as a lingua franca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_lingua_franca) — a version of the language with its local characteristics turned down to enable communication between people who might speak rather differently at home.

__Before Koine__ 

Before around the 4th century BC, Greek society was extremely localized. For geographical and political reasons, Greeks tended to live in what we today call “city-states” but which might more accurately be called “micro-state”: political units that were very small and highly suspicious of each other. This tended to diminish travel and immigration: as far as an Athenian was concerned “foreigners” started at the borders of Attica, 30 miles away.

That kind of fragmentation led to linguistic diversification. As Greek settlement spread out, the new towns generally retained the speech habits of their ancestors creating a [patchwork of different varieties of Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_dialects):

The dialects were mutually intelligible but also easily identifiable. The most obvious signs were vowel shifts: where an Athenian might call his mother μήτηρ (meeteer)a Spartan would want his μᾱ́τηρ (mahteer). There were also local items of vocabulary — for example a Spartan would call his left his λαιός, his “army hand” where an Athenian would call it ἀριστερός, his “bestest” hand. The existence of these differences was a commonplace of Greek life: making fun of other people’s accents and locutions was a staple of Athenian comedy (and ever since, a bane to translators thereof).

__An international standard__ 

After the career of Alexander, the old city-state political regime was replaced by much larger kingdoms, often ruling over non-Greeks in far-flung realms. The new kingdoms aggressively recruited Greeks from “back home” to staff their armies and bureaucracies, which created new opportunities for mixing between different dialect groups. As travel, migration, and commerce increased, the old dialectical differences began to wear away._Koine_ simply means “common” and it’s the ancient equivalent of TV English — stripped of strong regional identifiers and somewhat standardized.

As an offspring of the the big Hellenistic kingdoms Koine was ultimately based on the [Attic dialect of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_Greek): Alexander’s father had imported Athenian-trained scribes to run his own bureaucracy and so Macedonian officialdom used Attic spelling and vocabulary, even though the Macedonian brand of spoken Greek was closer to Doric norms. This practice survived the partition of Alexander’s empire, so Koine is essentially Attic but with many Attic peculiarities rubbed off and some old-fashioned constructions simplified away.

Over the next seven or eight centuries Koine Greek remained the language of law and commerce in Greek-ruled parts of the world. Places like Rome and Carthage picked up Greek as a second language for business or diplomacy, and in general the Greek they picked up was the simpler koine. For ordinary people, though, it was very convenient to be able to write a letter from Olbia on the Black Sea to a correspondent in Sicily knowing that the message would be read and understood.

In the literary world the older dialects survived as models — Doric for choral singing, and Attic for drama and oratory, and of course [Homer’s unique dialect ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Greek)which was studied by anyone with pretensions to culture. Most of our Greek texts today were preserved by Greeks who prized the literary heritage of the older dialects even though they lived in a world where Koine was the norm — just as many speakers of English today still cherish the slightly unfamiliar patterns of Jane Austen or Shakespeare. So, a well educated Greek might make fun of the fairly homely Koine of the Gospels, but would have no trouble understanding it. Conversely a provincial like [Lucian,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian) whose native language was Syriac, pride himself on his ability to sound like an Athenian gentleman even though his daily language would have been Koine.

__The standardization of the alphabet.__ 

Just as older spoken Greek had a lot of local peculiarities, so too older versions of written Greek had a number of variants which were sometimes challenging for travelers. There were [three main version of written Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Greek_alphabets#:~:text=The%20%22red%22%20(or%20western,later%20standard%20Greek%20alphabet%20emerged.), along with some local variants (and one fascinating outlier in the form of the [Cypriot syllabary](https://www.quora.com/When-did-the-Cypriot-syllabary-get-out-of-use-How-much-did-the-Greek-world-outside-Cyprus-know-about-it/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=c3fcc33d&srid=zLvM)).

Before the age of Alexander, older written Greek had three main forms, the so-called “red”, “green” and “blue” alphabets which all adapted older Phoenican characters in slightly different ways. The “red” alphabet eventually passed to a number of Italian communities and became the basis of the modern Latin alphabet. Koine eventually settled on a version of the “blue” [Ionic alphabet](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ionic-alphabet) — essentially the one you’d get if you look up “Greek alphabet” today. In this (as so often) Koine followed the lead of Athens, which voluntarily abandoned its own local alphabet in 402 and adopted the Ionic version.

_Competing early Greek letter forms (the top row is in lower case, which didn’t evolve until the 9th century). The eventual winners were_ __ΑΒΓΔΕΗΖΘΙΚΛΜΝΞΟΠΡΣΤΥΦΧΨΩ__ 

Before the standardization emerged, reading inscriptions from a foreign city could be a challenge even if the spoken forms were recognizable — the old Phoenician letter shapes were sometimes used in contradictory ways (for example the Phoenician character [shin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_(letter)) __W__  was sometimes turned to the right to make the Greek sigma __Σ,__ but sometimes written at a slant to make the s-like __𐌔__ , sometimes inverted to make __M__ , and sometimes represented with the Phoenician character [samekh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samekh) __𐤎.__  So, in the 5th century BC there were at least 4 main ways to create the sound “s”: on top of the verbal differences this was a serious obstacle to the spread of written messages. It didn’t help that some cities wrote left-to-right, and others followed the old Phoenician right-to-left order and flipped their characters according. Worst of all was the style called [boustrophedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon) or “ox-turning” which went _both_  ways.

Once long-distance communication became more common and necessary, these sources of confusion had to be resolved. A handful of the possible letter forms were excluded, and spellings changed to accommodate their absence:

__Ϝ__  which sounded like a “w” (in the “red” alphabets this eventually became our “f”)

__Ϙ__  roughly a “q” (which it became in the Latin alphabet)

__𐌇__  an “h” (which it became in our alphabet — but Koine had no dedicated “h” )

__Ϻ__  which was an alternative way of writing “S” (in Ionic, it’s Σ — both come from the Phoenician _shin_ , written 𐤔)

__ϡ__ for a sound in between “ss” and “tt”. This survived in mathematics as the symbol for 900.

There were also graphic standardizations, generally around the blue-Greek Ionic characters — for example, old Athenian inscriptions used __𐌈__  or __⨁__  for the sound “th” but in Koine the form __ϴ__ won out, so that’s the one you see in modern transcriptions. Koine also adopted the Ionic habit of treating __Η__ as a vowel for a long “ee” sound, rather than the consonant “h”. __𐤎__  became __Ξ__  and only represented the the sound “ks”, leaving __Σ__ as the canonical “s”. On the other hand, the blue-Greek Attic __𐤋__  (which of course is the ancestor of the Latin “L”) was surpassed by the red-Greek __Λ.*__ 

The process of standardization took a while, and older forms still survived in some places, but by around 200 BC the “koine alphabet” was mostly stable and the Greek world had a more or less unified way to write — anywhere from Afghanistan to Spain, a Greek speaker could almost certainly read a sign or a contract, even if his accent struck his hearers as a bit funny.

__New forms for paper__ 

During the Hellenistic period (and thus, while Koine was the dominant dialect) the written forms also evolved in a more cursive direction. Older samples of Greek writing are usually chiseled into stone or scratched onto pottery shards, which encourage harsh linear forms:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-454d767940ef8c3875e0e237176f9e3c)

_An Athenian pot-sherd inscribed with the name of Pericles, using the old Attic alphabet. In standard (that is, Koine) Greek this would be written ΠΕΡΙΚΛΗΣ ΞΑΝΘΙΠΠΟΥ_ 

The linear forms survived on coins and in inscriptions. However with the Ptolemies in Egypt exporting papyrus in great bulk — and their rivals in Pergamon mass producing parchment — writing with reed pens became the norm, so the letter forms became more fluid. The most visible change was that the letter [sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma), __Σ__ was simplified into the C-shaped “lunate sigma” __Ϲ,__ while [epsilon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon) also became more curved, changing from __Ε__  to a lunate __Ⲉ.__ 

The [Uncial script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_script) of the Roman period was more rounded and pen-friendly, though it only included capital letters. The shapes that you’ll see in a printed Greek text today are the final evolution of [Greek minuscule,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_minuscule) the scribal hand of the 9th-10th century [Macedonian Renaissance.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_Renaissance#:~:text=Macedonian%20Renaissance%20is%20a%20label,classical%20hellenic%20motifs%20into%20Christian)

This is a good illustration of the evolution of the letter forms from the angular shapes of the classical era to the minuscules of a thousand years ago:

_The opening of the Odyssey in several different hands, spanning the 1st century BC to the 15th century AD. The last three entries include lower-case letters, a Byzantine innovation from around the 9th century._ 

You can see the heritage of uncial letter forms in the Cyrillic, Coptic and Gothic alphabets, all of which emerged from Greek uncials. Among other features you’ll note the lunate sigma: __CCCP__  is actually Союз Советских Социалистических Республик or “_Soyuz Sovetskikh Sotsialisticheskikh Respublik”._  In all of these additional letters extended the 24-character Greek alphabet to include more sounds. Gothic, interestingly, borrowed characters from the much older red-Greek scripts, which survived in the [Elder Futhark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Futhark) alphabet, marking a return of characters which were abandoned in Greek several hundred years earlier.

_*If you look at the table of character comparisons, you’ll notice how many of the the differences are actually flips of the original Phoenician forms — usually left - right, but sometimes (as in the case of lambda) up - down._
