There is a reverse example in the legend of [Orion](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Orion), who was blinded but then healed by Helios (the sun). I think there's a citation in Lucian of Samosata. It was made into a painting in the 16th c:

[Blind Orion Searching for the Rising Sun](http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/437326)

Some versions of the story of [Phineus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineus) attribute his blindness to the wrath of Helios: [Helios: The Sun](http://mythagora.com/bios/helios.html)
