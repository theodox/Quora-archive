My “plan” consists of somehow tricking Romanophile Quoran and martial artist [Assaph Mehr](https://www.quora.com/profile/Assaph-Mehr) into taking my place. It's extremely unlikely that an out of shape computer nerd like myself would have a good shot at survival.

Failing that is try to score a gallic longswo and have it ground down into something like a rapier. Romans did use the point, unlike a lot of ancient swordsmen. However they specialized in smash-and-stab tactics that were oriented around formation fighting and their big infantry shields. They would not have a lot of experience with a full fencing lunge and the reach it gives. Chain mail - the most common armor — would not be very protective against a straight lunge.

That — combined with the fact that I'd be about 8″ taller than my average opponent in those days would be my only hope. I'd have a tough time with the retinarii, armed with tridents, though. And those big Gallic swords were softer than a real Renaissance rapier — it would tricky to do effective parries.
