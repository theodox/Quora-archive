Almost certainly not. As far as we know nobody from the Mediterranean was in a position to interact with Polynesian culture before the 16th century or so.

In the Roman period mariners — presumably, including a few Roman-era Phoenicians — sailed pretty routinely from the Red Sea ports of Berenice and Myos Hormus in Egypt to India and Sri Lanka. The farthest-ranging made it at least as far east as [Óc Eo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93c_Eo), which they knew as “Cattigara”. But even though that’s an amazing journey it’s only about half way to Polynesia — there’s still another 10,000 kilometers or so to travel.

Even though Polynesians participated in regional trade networks its unlikely they had anything that a Mediterranean trader cared to trade for. Only compact high-value goods — silks, spices, and gems — justified the risk and expense of the Indian Ocean trade.
