Nowadays the show de-emphasizes keynotes, since the industry is so big and diverse: it's very rare that a single announcement or declaration will really set the tone for the show anymore when the audience now covers AAA and indie, console, PC and Mobile, and a global market. 

Probably the most indispensable pat of the show is the Flash Forward session, which showcases 30 second previews of all of the conference talks. It's a great way to get an overview of promising sessions and it's also a good way to get an overview of all the issues the industry is dealing with in a given year. 

I'd also recommend finding the round table sessions for your speciality or discipline. These are great for networking and also for getting a candid look at what your peers are thinking.

As for the parties... Meh. Most of them are generic bad-DJ-plus-bad-drinks shindigs that are too loud for conversation but too full of game developers for actual revelry. 9 times in ten if you see someone dancing they are in PR or marketing ;) 

In years gone by Valve's parties were a standout because they were more amenable to actually talking to people. Haven't been in a couple of years so I don't know if that's still true. The really prime party used to be the late-night one in the conference management suite, since it was a insider-y as you can get in a geeky industry; but that one is no more. The "Level99" party for speakers and special guests is a prime invite but hard to get into if you are not presenting at the show.
