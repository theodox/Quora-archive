# I studied classics in college, and I'd like to read Homer in the original Greek on my own. What text(s) should I use to work through the Greek, the Loeb Classical Library editions, or something else?

I’d avoid the Loeb, or keep it as a backup — while it’s great to have the English handy, it’s easy for it to become a crutch. Loeb translations also tend to be rather stiff, which is even more of a shame when dealing with Homer than with most translation tasks. The [Geoffrey Steadman editions](https://www.amazon.com/Geoffrey-Steadman/e/B00BXINVYU/ref=pd_sim_14_bl_2/131-8319041-7880503?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0984306595&pd_rd_r=fd28808c-7f4d-11e9-b31d-a3211b75eab9&pd_rd_w=VdYGq&pd_rd_wg=xwe1M&pf_rd_p=90485860-83e9-4fd9-b838-b28a9b7fda30&pf_rd_r=FP0GZWNR92XJ7EFYC4D2&refRID=FP0GZWNR92XJ7EFYC4D2), which are from around the same time, offer Greek text along with vocabulary and grammar notes but not continuous translation. Plus you can get them as softbacks and so feel freer to write on them than on those dignified Loebs (with their flimsy, easily torn paper!)

If you’re not already familiar with the Homeric dialect, Clyde Pharr’s [Homeric Greek: A Book for Beginners](https://www.amazon.com/Homeric-Greek-Beginners-Chicana-Am%C3%A9ricas/dp/0806141646/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=pharr+homer&qid=1558830146&s=gateway&sr=8-1) is a great way to make the transition from the more familiar Attic forms. Purists prefer the older editions, if you can find one used — though on the flip side older editions typically expect a lot more serious foundation in English grammar than most students have today.

You can also get the entire text with as much or as little side-by-side translation as you want to see, and hyperlinked vocabulary from [The Perseus Project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0133). The UI could be better…. a lot better, actually… but having the whole text along with notes and vocab all in one place is hard to beat.
