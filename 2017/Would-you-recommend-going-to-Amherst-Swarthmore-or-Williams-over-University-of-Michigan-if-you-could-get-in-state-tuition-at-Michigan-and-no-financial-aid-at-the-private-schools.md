I absolutely loved my Williams education, and I got a lot of benefit from it that has nothing to do with my career and everything to do with what kind of person I turned out to be.

I would love to be able to recommend it without reservation to anybody. But I don’t think I can.

Unfortunately, private education in the US has gotten unforgivably expensive. A lot of people who would benefit hugely from small liberal arts schools are better off finding more economical options. Michigan, in particular, is an excellent school and the in-state tuition is about half of what you’d pay for one of the prestige liberal arts schools in the northeast. I’m an unapologetic fan of liberal arts, but I can’t say that the difference between UMich and my favorite kind of school is really worth the additional $125,000 without some kind of concrete, bankable economic payoff.

Every school has good connections with some businesses, communities, or governments. If you are dead set on a job on Wall Street, in management consulting, or in legal-financial world of the east coast then the extra tuition you’d pay for a school like Williams may make sense: the prestige matters and the connections you make will stand you in good stead when you’re getting started.

On the other hand if you’re planning on starting your own business right out of school, or going to work in a nonprofit — or if you want to work in video games, like I do — the decision is much harder. If your life plans don’t involve a career where the prestige of the school will make a material difference, you probably should go somewhere affordable.

Top-tier private schools have gotten _very_ expensive, especially relative to in-state tuition at good state universities. With a four year cost in the ballpark of a quarter-million dollars you can’t just follow your heart — which is a shame given the huge addition that a liberal arts school can be to your life as a human being. Unfortunately that experience has become a luxury commodity, too expensive to buy just because of its spiritual appeal: the cost of attending a top-tier liberal arts school is so high nowadays that you can’t do it for love of learning alone.

There’s an old Williams quote that says “The ideal college is [Mark Hopkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hopkins_(educator)) on one end of a log and a student on the other.” Unfortunately modern liberal arts schools have gotten pretty far from that ideal: nowadays the log costs about the same as the median house price in the United States.
