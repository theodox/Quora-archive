Zeppelins were the first serious aerial bombardment platform — they were effectively weaponized before airplanes: the first air raid in history was the bombing of Liege, Belgium on August 6 1914 - eight days after the start of the war, at a time when airplane “weaponry” consisted of pistols and bricks in the hands of pilots.

despite their fragility and beauty, they were the first tentative steps on the road to the Blitz, Dresden, and Hiroshima.
