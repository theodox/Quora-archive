No. The Hellenes are nominally the children of [Hellen](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0104:entry=hellen-bio-1), one of the sons of [Deucalion](https://www.theoi.com/Heros/Deukalion.html), the Greek Noah who repopulated the works after Zeus destroyed mankind in a great flood. The sons of Hellen, in turn, were more or less the ancestors of the Greek dialect groups: Dorus for the Dorians, Xuthus for the Ionians and Achaeans, and Aeolus for the Aeolians.

Helen with one “L” is, mythologically, many generations later. There was no authoritative chronology for all Greek mythology but to give a general sense the [Parian Marble ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parian_Chronicle)puts Deucalion’s flood in our 1529 BC and the fall of Troy in 1204 BC.
