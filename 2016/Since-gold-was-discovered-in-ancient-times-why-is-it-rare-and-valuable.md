The malleability of gold is an important factor: you can work gold very effectively without very much metal-working technology. So gold was a popular choice for ornaments and decorations (which are some of the earliest uses of metals) in the very earliest days of settled life.

This gave it a prestige value which was out of proportion to its practical uses -- one which was all the greater for being very, very old: These gold ornaments are from the [Varna Necropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_Necropolis) in Bulgaria, a flourishing neolithic site around 4500 BC.

Although these folks would have copper tools (like the axe head at lower left) most of their tools were stone or wood -- but they still made lovely jewelry from gold, thanks to its easy workability.

There have been historic periods when other metals were more valuable -- in the early Iron Age, when iron was rare, it frequently competed with gold as a prestige metal -- but gold's association with luxury and elegance goes back at least 7,000 years or more. Beyond a certain point it's valuable because people think it's valuable.
