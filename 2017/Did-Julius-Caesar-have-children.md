He had one recognized daughter, [Julia, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(daughter_of_Caesar))whom he married to Pompey while the two were still allies (by all accounts Pompey was genuinely in love with Julia, and the alliance between Caesar and Pompey remained firm until after her death in 54 BC).

Cleopatra claimed that her son, whom she named [Caesarion, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarion)was Caesar’s child and many Roman observers agreed; however many of Caesar’s political supporters denied that the boy — raised in Egypt by his Greek mother — was really Caesar’s child.

When Caesar’s _adopted_ son Octavian (the future emperor Augustus) defeated Cleopatra and her new lover Marc Antony in 30 BC, Caesarion “disappeared.” Most ancient sources claim that he was murdered on Octavian’s order, but there was a rumor that he had escaped to India with part of his mother’s treasure. In either case he was never heard from again.
