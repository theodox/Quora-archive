There were a few— the Celts were a very widely distributed group (from Ireland to Asia minor) and different Celtic groups picked up writing in different ways and at different times.

In northern Italy and southern France, some Celtic communities adopted either the[ Old Italic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Italic_script) script or the classical Greek alphabet. Some of these inscriptions go back very far; there are examples of inscriptions in Lepontic (an early Celtic language from Switzerland) dating back to the 5th century BC.

_A Celtiberian inscription from Spain_ 

In Spain, a separate [Celtiberian script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtiberian_script) also derived from Greek letters. It was found mostly along the eastern coasts of Spain where there were Greek (and later Carthaginian) trading posts, and where the Celtiberians usually settled in cities.

After the Romans conquered Northern Italy, France, and Spain the Roman alphabet displaced the alternatives. Britain picked up Roman characters from across the Channel even before the Roman conquest.

_The_ _[Larzac tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larzac_tablet)_ _from 1st century southern France is one of the few surviving inscriptions in Gallic._ 

The only completely native script was [Ogham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogham), which arose in Ireland sometimes after the 2d century. Ireland was never conquered by the Romans, so the impulse to pick up the Roman alphabet didn’t arrive until after the conversion of the island to Christianity.

These are a handful out of the the dozens of different Celtic cultures. The majority of the others haven’t left written records in their own languages. More Celtic peoples picked up literacy in Greek or Latin rather than their native languages.

This mixed picture of literacy produces interesting side effects, like this coin from a Celtic people living in the Balkans

which is a derivation of this one from Phillip of Macedon

Except that in the Celtic version the lettering is reduced to abstract squiggles.
