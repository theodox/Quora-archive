# Did Cleopatra really speak Egyptian? The only source for her knowledge of the Egyptian language is Plutarch even though he did not explicitly mention it. He appears to have doubted it or her capacity in the Egyptian language.

There’s not a lot of other evidence to go on beside Plutarch’s statement (at Antony, 27) — although it seems fairly unambiguous.

> There was sweetness also in the tones of her voice; and her tongue, like an instrument of many strings, she could readily turn to whatever language she pleased, so that in her interviews with Barbarians she very seldom had need of an interpreter, but made her replies to most of them herself and unassisted, whether they were Ethiopians, Troglodytes, Hebrews, Arabians, Syrians, Medes or Parthians. Nay, it is said that she knew the speech of many other peoples also, although the kings of Egypt before her had not even made an effort to learn the native language, and some actually gave up their Macedonian dialect.

With little else to go on, we can’t be completely certain of course. However, [somewhat later in the same work (28.2) ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0007%3Achapter%3D28%3Asection%3D2)Plutarch mentions that his grandfather was friends with a doctor, Philotas of Amphissa, who worked in Antony’s court. Plutarch cites this Philotas as a witness for some of Antony’s lavish dinners and entertainments — but presumably as a member of the court circle he’s a plausible first-hand source for the information about Cleopatra’s manners and speech. Certainly Plutarch’s picture is unique in its general independence from the tropes of Roman political writing — where it was Cleopatra’s supposed role as as _femme fatale_  rather than her talents as a linguist that dominated the picture.

It’s probably also worth mentioning that Cleopatra did make [a frequent public point of her “special relationship” with the goddess Isis](https://erenow.com/biographies/cleopatra-last-queen-of-egypt/6.html). This was one of the several ways the very clever queen tried to strengthen the fairly shaky foundations of he throne — whatever her personal feelings, a lavish public re-commitment to the ancient Ptolemaic policy of patronizing Egyptian religion was a good way to shore up her political position. Learning to speak Egyptian was also a lot cheaper than the traditional policy of building temples and supporting the large priestly colleges. Given the various economic difficulties she faced it might have been a clever political stroke as well as a matter of conviction.
