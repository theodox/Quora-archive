At least in early modern Europe, tar was an internationally traded bulk commodity precisely because of its usefulness. The Baltic was the historic center of the tar trade, with Finland — then part of Sweden — as a major producer. Poland and Russia were also involved in the tar trade.

The tar was shipped in 64-gallon barrels (‘hogsheads’) by the thousands; Charles II of England once tried to negotiate a purchase of 4,000 hogsheads (= 256,000 gallons!) from Russia as a way to bypass high Swedish prices.

Access to shipbuilding resources (not just tar, but also timber and cordage) was a critical strategic problem for the British, in particular. It was nervousness about access to the vital Baltic resources that led to the [British attack on Copenhagen in 1807](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Copenhagen_(1807)).
