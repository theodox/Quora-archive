Caesar won the war against the last Pompeians at [Munda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Munda) in March of 45, just about a year to the day before his assassination; his reign was only 363 days. He was extremely busy during the the first part of that year demobilizing several of his legions -- a complex process which involved a lot of political, economic and strategic calculation. So he had less than 12 months of sole power, and not all of it was spent in Rome. 

The specific timing on the Ides of March has an emotional component as well. Caesar and Antony were co-consuls in 44, and at the [Lupercalia](http://www.livius.org/caa-can/caesar/caesar_t18.html) in February of that year there were many public demonstrations 'demanding' that Caesar accept a crown and become king: As Shakespeare had it:



> You all did see that on the Lupercal. I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious...


Since antiquity it's been debated if this was a trial balloon put up by Caesar himself, a plot by his enemies to embarrass him, or a spontaneous popular movement -- but whatever the cause, it was an ominous moment for diehard Republicans: particularly because Caesar (who publicly declined the crown) also summarily -- and illegally -- dismissed the two tribunes who had arrested royalist demonstrators.

_Rex Harrison as Caesar -- that's not a crown, but wearing purple is also a monarchical prerogative..._ 

Plutarch (LXII) puts the entry of Brutus into the conspiracy right after his account of the Lupercalia, which actually makes sense: although Caesar prided himself on not surrounding himself with armed guards, the Romans had by this point had more than a century of on-and-off civil wars with plenty of experience of informers, proscriptions and disappearances: No conspiracy would likely remain secret for long.
