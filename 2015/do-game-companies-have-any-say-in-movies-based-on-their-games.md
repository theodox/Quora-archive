The key question is who owns the intellectual property - the game, setting, characters and story are copyrighted so the owner of the copyright can license them any way they wish, and usually the licensing agreements will reserve pretty substantial control over the way in which the characters, story or setting are used. 

Often, though, the IP rights are not owned by the developers. Creating a new franchise from scratch is very expensive, often tens of millions of dollars. Very frequently developers will have to trade away the ownership of the intellectual property in exchange for the money needed to get the project started; frequently it's the publisher, rather than the game studio, which owns the IP. That's why, for example, Microsoft controls the licensing for movies, games, toys and books based on Halo even though the story and characters were created by Bungie.
