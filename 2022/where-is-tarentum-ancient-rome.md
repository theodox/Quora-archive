_Tarentum_  is the Latin name for the city of [Taras](http://www.hellenicaworld.com/Greece/Geo/en/Tarentum.html), a Greek colony (mostly, but not exclusively, founded by Spartans) in the “heel” of Italy around the 8th century BC. It is today the Italian city of [Taranto](https://www.britannica.com/place/Taranto-Italy).

_The “dolphin rider” was the most common coin motif in Taras/Tarentum. This one dates roughly fto. The time when the Tarentines invited Pyrrhus, a cousin of Alexander the Great, to help them fight the Romans. It staved off the Roman conquest for a couple of generations — the city was finally conquered for good by the Romans in 212 BC after siding with Hannibal._
