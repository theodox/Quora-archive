_pedicabo_ is usually translated as “I’ll sodomize you”, but the physical connotation is not entirely clear. The root word is the from the Greek παῖς, “boy” in but in the Latin context the implication is “I’ll treat you like a boy-toy” in “[the Greek way](https://www.quora.com/Did-Ancient-Greek-men-have-affairs-with-young-men)”.

_irrumabo_ is more or less “I’ll shove it down your throat” (_rumen_  is “throat” or “gullet”). It’s forced oral sex.

The quote is from [Catullus 16;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus_16) the link includes a non-genteel version of the whole thing and a discussion of its long history of scandalizing later readers.
