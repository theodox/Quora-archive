For fun!

Seriously, you have to remember this is a hobby for a lot of us.

As a dyed-in-the-wool pedant this place is a great outlet for my irritating Little Perfesser complex. Dumping all of this stuff about Theoderic the Ostrogoth or the relationship between Sumerians and Akkadians on my friends and family is a no-win strategy. They don’t enjoy it (except on the rare occasions then they willingly venture into the lion’s den with a question of their own) and I have just enough social sensitivity not to enjoy inflicting my obsessions on the unwilling.

On Quora, there’s always somebody incautious enough to ask. And there are a lot of people who love to nerd out on the same obscurantist topics that I do; like many persecuted minorities, we pedants have found power in uniting over the internet.

If you’re that attached to the subject matter, it’s hard _not_  to want to put things properly in place. You have all this fun stuff you want to share (_psst! wanna know more about the Hittites?)_ and it’s frustrating when the questioners are pitching junk. A sizable fraction of questions really are radically flawed: they’re based on assumptions or misunderstandings so deep that you have to either (a) just skip them, (b) try to cajole the OP into rephrasing the question or (c) try to write the answer in a way you hope will have some value despite the low quality of the question. You can’t “just answer” your special domain’s equivalent of ‘have you stopped beating your wife?’

I certainly agree that beating up on somebody right out of the gate is boorish. You don’t know how sincere they are, what kind of education they have, or how good their English is. Going in guns blazing is rude. But if you try to look at it from the perspective of the answerer, I think you’ll see that frequently a bad question is like a shoddy piece of raw material: the craftsman does what he can (hopefully without being too mean about it) but it is, in the end, an annoyance. The real alternative is most often simply clicking on to something else and leaving the OP twisting in the wind.
