# Why is it that I find Maya to be easier to model with than Max? Is it the teacher’s fault or it's just my way of thinking?

Art tools are a very personal thing;. If you’ve been active in the 3D modeling business for any length of time you’ll discover that flame war between fans of the different packages take up way too much of some people’s time and effort. It definitely comes from the same dubious part of the human brain that gets people up in arms about Macs versus Windows, Xboxes versus Playstations, or [tabs versus spaces](http://www.businessinsider.com/tabs-vs-spaces-from-silicon-valley-2016-5).

There are definitely some functional differences between Max and Maya, but they are really less important than the similarities. The differences that seem to motivate people aren’t usually about technical functionality — they have more to do with taste, style, and “feel,” which makes them extremely personal. It’s natural to care about the style and feel of a tool you use for many hours at a time.

If you’re a hobbyist, just run with what you like. On the other hand if you’re a pro or an aspiring pro it’s worth making the effort to learn both packages. Often you will find individual features in the program you dislike that you actually wish you could have in your preferred environment. Plus, learning a second program helps to teach you which parts of the one you already knew are rooted in the real basics (3d math, geometry, and logic) and which are just stylistic differences. Seeing the same same basic idea expressed two (or more!) ways is good because it helps you separate of the fundamentals from the mere accidents of UI.

In many ways, the more the merrier — besides Max and Maya there’s also Blender, Cinema 4D, Modo, and a bunch of lesser known but often very useful tools. The more of them you’ve played with, the better perspective you will have on your favorite. You’ll definitely _have_  a favorite, and that’s fine, but being a 3d artist is not about the tools, it’s about making art and you can make great art with any of them. Don’t feel guilty for being more tuned in to one than the others — but don’t neglect to learn what the others have to teach.

If you want some proof that even the vets have their preferences and sometimes have a hard time avoiding fanboy flame wars, consider [this thread](http://discourse.techart.online/t/transitioning-studio-from-3ds-max-to-maya/8646/26). And then chillax.
