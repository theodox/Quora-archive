Typically no .

The usual relationship is similar to the way a book publisher supports an author. The studio is paid an “advance” on expected revenues in order to fund development. The money is usually filed out in increments tied to specific development milestones, usually 4–6 per year,. When the game ships, the “advance” is paid back out of the profits — though the definition of “profit” is contentious because different publishers have different ways of accounting for things like marketing or tech support.

Most often the advance is charged against the profits at a premium, so that a $10m game budget might only pay off its advance when the game earns $15m. After the advance is paid back the studio earns royalties on profits; the royalty rate varies by deal but is usually in the range of 25%.

To the extent that this kind of deal involves “equity” it usually involves ownership of IP — it’s quite common for publishers to take ownership the IP of a game they finance as part of the deal. Most studios hate this, since IP ownership is one of the keys to financial stability — however a studio without a lot of money in the bank will often have to include the IP to get a deal at all. A lot of the appeal of platforms like Steam is that they typically don’t touch IP — on the other hand they also don’t usually provide development advances. This tend to put s limit on how big a self-funded game can be, so it’s a better model for indies than for would-be AAA projects.

Equity-based deals do happen, but rarely on a project -by-project basis: they are usually based on buying a part of an ongoing business instead of a single game. Two good examples are Tencent’s shares in Riot Games and Epic — these are not project-based deals, instead they focus on ongoing revenue streams rather than the typical single-product cycle. In this regard this type of deal is much more like a traditional business equity investment— it’s snout owning part of a _business_ , not a _product_ .

Another reason for equity deals is the desire to lock in a valued developer for a platform or publisher. The industry tends to cycle between times when lots of developers are “first party” — that is, owned by publishers or platform holders — and times when most devs are “third party” or independent. The pendulum seems to be swinging back toward first party right now (my studio was acquired this summer, for example) but the cycle usually reverses itself about every 7–10 years. The total number of these kinds of deals is always fairly low, since the publishers rarely need more than one studio in a given genre or market — one racing game studio, one FPS studio, etc.

Some publishers have also experimented with a “finishing” model, where studios take a game to a fairly polished state on their own — without advances— and the publisher provides money for polish and marketing. In that version it’s up to the studio to find development funds, so some studios try to do that using VC money — which generally means equity. However there are not a lot of VCs who understand the games business and the risk/reward profile of most games is not that attractive compared to other tech businesses. So, that model has been tried but it’s fairly rare.

__Tldr__ : Games, like movies, are so risky that project-based financing rather than equity is the most common option. There are exceptions but the most common route remains project financing, often backed by IP. Equity deals are usually about gaining a stake in an existing business, rather than financing a particular product.
