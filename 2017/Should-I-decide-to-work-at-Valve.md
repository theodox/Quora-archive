Well, if traditional industry patterns are still in play it’s more like “should Valve hire me.” Valve has historically been one of the best paying companies in the industry, it’s very successful and stable. As such, it’s able to be highly selective in its hiring. It’s one of the toughest-to-land gigs in gaming.

That said Valve’s culture is quite distinctive and it’s not for everybody. The company’s famous [manifesto](http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf) is perhaps a bit idealized, but it definitely shows the core values of the organization — which amounts to “come here and impress us with your cool stuff.” It’s going to be an uncomfortable place for people who want to concentrate on something narrow and technical, or for people who are uncomfortable without a clear list of responsibilities, or for people who don’t want to work in a highly decentralized environment.

Most people _think_  they’d like a lot of freedom and no managers to worry about. In practice a lot of people find it nerve-wracking; it takes a particular kind of passion to be comfortable when the only real measure of success is how your efforts look to your peers. It can be a tough lifestyle for introverts or people who prefer efficient order to creative chaos.

All that said — not a lot of people who get the offer turn it down. Good luck!
