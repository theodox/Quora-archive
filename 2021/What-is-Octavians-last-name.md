If you mean his _family_  name, it’s _Julius_  — and you would be well advised to use it correctly.

The future emperor was born _Gaius Octavius Thurinus._ However when he was adopted by Julius Caesar he left his native _gens Octavia_ and became part of the _gens Julia._ In ordinary Roman usage, he should have become _Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus._ For a Roman adoptee, the adjectival form of your birth gens was something like a hyphenated name today, a way of acknowledging both of your families: [Scipio Aemilianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scipio_Aemilianus), the destroyer of Carthage, was born _Publius Aemilianus Paullus,_ but after his adoption he became _Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus._ 

The future Augustus, however, was not an ordinary adoptee.

The adoption was only made public with the reading of Caesar’s will. It also placed the newly-minted young Caesar in a precarious position: he was heir to a tremendous fortune and to a vast political network, but he was also only 18 years old. Moreover it had been widely expected that Caesar’s adoptive heir would be Marc Antony — not an unknown young relative who had not been a key part of Caesar’s entourage. The new-minted Caesar, therefore, was extremely eager to identify himself with his deceased adoptive father: from his very first appearance at Rome, a month or so after Caesar’s death, his public persona was always that of Caesar’s heir and son.

Antony dragged his feet on the process of recognizing the adoption, which didn’t become formally legalized until August of 43, but the former Octavius began flaunting the Caesarian name immediately: as Cicero noted in April of 4

> Octavius here treats me with great respect and friendliness. His own people addressed him as "Caesar," but Philippus did not, so I did not do so either.

Cicero, [Ad Atticum, 14.12](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0022%3Atext%3DA%3Abook%3D14%3Aletter%3D12)

As the new Caesar, the young politician insisted on being known as _Gaius Julius Caesar_ , dropping the customary _Octavianus._ Cicero switched to _Caesar_ in public while he was courting the new Caesar as a political ally, though in private he remained Octavianus, or, more commonly, “the boy.” Marc Antony was happy to remind him of his real origins, derisively referring to him as _Thurinus_  rather than _Caesar._ 

However, once Antony and Octavian allied (November of 43) it became dangerous to use any address except _Gaius Julius Caesar._ In English-language sources it’s customary to refer to the future emperor as Octavian or Octavianus during the years between Caesar’s death and his [assumption of the title Augustus in 27 BC](https://www.thegreatcoursesdaily.com/unpacking-the-titles-of-augustus-wordplay-and-double-meanings/), and as Augustus from then on, but this is a modern convention. For example in the English translation of Appian, you’ll see something like this:

> Octavian and Antony composed their differences on a small, depressed islet in the river Lavinius, near the city of Mutina

But in the original Greek it reads

> __Καῖσαρ__ μὲν καὶ Ἀντώνιος ἐς φιλίαν ἀπ᾽ ἔχθρας συνῄεσαν ἀμφὶ Μουτίνην πόλιν, ἐς νησῖδα τοῦ Λαβινίου ποταμοῦ

(Appian, [Civil War, 4.1.2](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0231%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D1))

That is, “__Caesar__ and Antony…” Cicero is the only contemporary who actually used _Octavianus_  in writing; all of our other surviving sources use _Caesar._ 

In most of his own official presentations between 43 and 27, the future Augustus used _Imperator Caesar Divi Filius._ There were other titles which came and went as political moments passed, but the one constant was the all-important name of _Caesar_ . It was his most prized political position and the most important one he bequeathed to his own adoptive heir, Tiberius Julius Caesar, né Tiberius Claudius Nero. After the remarkable career first of the dictator, then of the emperor, the name acquired a magical aura which made it one of most potent attributes of Roman rule.
