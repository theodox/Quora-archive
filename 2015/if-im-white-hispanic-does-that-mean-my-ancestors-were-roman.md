If you're of Iberian descent -- Spanish or Portuguese -- there's several different strands that might be there (of course these are not mutually exclusive). Here's some, in chronological order from oldest to newest:

__Basques__ . If your family name does not sound Spanish -- or if it seems to have a lot of Z's in it -- you may be a Basque. The Basques, who occupy the northwest corner of Spain, are the oldest inhabitants of the peninsula. Their language is unrelated to every other European language. They've apparently been there since the last Ice Age.

__Celtiberians__  The Celtiberians were closely related to the people we call 'Celts' -- the big, vague group that includes the Scots, Irish, Welsh and Bretons in France but anciently included the Gauls of France and Northern Italy.

__Carthaginians.__ The southern and eastern coasts of Spain were colonized by the Carthaginians, descendendants of traders from Phoenicia (Lebanon) who founded a powerful empire in North Africa around 1200 BC. Modern Spanish cities that are Carthaginian include Cadiz (which they called Agadir, "Fortress") and Cartagena (= "Carthago Nova" or "New Carthage" in Latin -- the Romans could not pronounce the Phoenician _Qart Hadasht_ ). When Hannibal crossed over the Alps with his elephant army he started from Spain, and Spanish troops formed the bulk of his army.

__Romans.__ The Romans defeated the Carthaginians in a series of wars between 264 and 146 BC. Large numbers of Romans settled in Spain after it was added to the empire. The Spanish provinces produced several emperors (Trajan, the first 'non-Roman' Roman emperor was born in modern Andalucia). 

Spain was part of the Roman empire for more than 500 years, the various peoples living there had a long time to mix with each other and with the many other ethnic groups in the empire -- which stretched from Scotland to Syria.

__Visigoths__ . As the Roman empire fell apart in the 400's several barbarian tribes grabbed territories and settled down. One of the biggest and most aggressive groups was the Visigoths -- the same outfit that sacked Rome in the year 410. They carved out a kingdom for themselves in Spain starting in 439. Despite their reputation as 'barbarians' they actually weren't that bad as rulers and they slowly merged with the existing inhabitants over the next three hundred years.

__Greeks.__ Well, technically "Romans". The ambitious Byzantine Emperor Justinian dreamed of re-uniting the Roman world in the 500's. His forces reconquered most of Italy, Sicily, and east coast of Spain for "Rome" (that is, for Constantinople, now Istanbul, where he reigned). From the 530s to the 620s, these regions were "Roman" again while the rest of the peninsula was Visigothic. 

__Moors.__  In 711, an army of Muslims from Mauretania (modern Morocco) invaded Spain and over the next generation conquered much of the peninsula, in particular its most prosperous parts. They first century or two of the Moorish conquest was a pretty good time even for the conquered -- like many smart imperialists (including the Carthaginians, Romans and Visigoths before them) the Moors didn't try too hard to force their ways on the conquered -- and, being part of the large, prosperous Muslim world at a time when most of Europe was poor and fragmented they had access to higher cultural and economic resources than the natives. From the 10th century onwards more repressive, fundamentalist regimes replaced the more relaxed original Moorish Caliphate

In all of these cases the newcomers didn't replace the existing population - they added into it. None of these new groups completely swamped the older layers but each left a distinctive stamp on Spanish culture... and, if your'e Spanish, probably somewhere in your DNA.
