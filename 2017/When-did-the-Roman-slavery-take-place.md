Thereâ€™s no way to date it. Slavery pre-dated the Roman republic (509 BC), and remained part of Roman law down to the end (476 in the west and 1453 in the east).

Over that time the legal status and treatment of slaves underwent several modifications; there were particularly bad times (the 2d century BC for example was glutted with slaves and treatment was particularly harsh) and relatively benign ones (slaves got more humanitarian protection in the second century, and protection from sexual exploitation in the fifth). However the existence of slavery was an un-questioned constant in Rome.
