Under good conditions — the summer sailing season and nothing serious going wrong — two to three months. Most of the mileage would be by sea, but a lot of the time would be the landward portion. If you were a privileged person — wealthy enough to travel on horseback rather than walking, politically connected enough to have permission to use military roads, and able to pay for 24 hour sailing — it could be just under two months. On the other hand if you were travelling in the winter, when sailing was difficult and roads could be closed it might be as much as a five month trip.

The [ORBIS](http://orbis.stanford.edu/orbis2012/#) project from Stanford is a great interactive app for figuring out precisely these kinds of interesting questions — you can use it to see how many variables could affect the travel times and the price of transport.
