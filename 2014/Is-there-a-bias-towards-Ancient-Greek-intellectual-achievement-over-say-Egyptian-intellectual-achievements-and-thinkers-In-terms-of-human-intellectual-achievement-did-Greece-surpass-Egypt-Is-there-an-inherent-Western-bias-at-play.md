# Is there a bias towards Ancient Greek intellectual achievement over say Egyptian intellectual achievements and thinkers? In terms of human intellectual achievement, did Greece surpass Egypt? Is there an inherent Western bias at play?

Here's a simple answer, in the form of a question.

Can you _name_  an ancient Egyptian mathematician? Even with the help of Google?

The Egyptians did a lot of impressive work in math, engineering, medicine and other sciences. But they did it in a context which is essentially disjoint from our own, and which contributes to it only via very indirect methods. 

Nobody in the west could read hieroglyphics until the 1820's. At that point, and for a long time before that, _neither could anybody in Egypt._  The written tradition of Egyptian culture was submerged completely for a _very_  long time. The familiar hieroglyphs were already falling out of use before the Persian conquest, 2500 years ago. Coptic - the modern descendant of ancient Egyptian - is a minority language in Egypt today (written in letters derived from Greek) , and the Coptic literary tradition owes much more to the world of the late Roman empire and the early Caliphate than to the traditions of the old dynasties. In the intervening years Egyptians had to do business in Aramaic, Persian, Greek, Latin or Arabic, and their unique culture was constantly jostling for position with other people's cultures.

Egyptian people persevered through all of that, but the delicate structures of high culture did not: Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs and eventually Turks replaced the upper classes of Egypt. without native patronage, most of what was written about and thought by the ancient Egyptians was lost or forgotten, being recovered only lately. A Chinese person today can pick up an inscription from the 5th C BC and puzzle it out, much as somebody with a year of high school Latin can read an inscription or a Latin poem. Only trained specialist can read hieroglyphs; and what they get to read is a very miscellaneous collection of things which were fortunate enough to survive the last 2,500 years. 

On top of all this, the literary traditions of Egypt don't give us the kind of information we crave. You get a lot of practical stuff - we know a lot about Egyptian math because we've found things like math exercise books. You get a lot of medical texts. A lot of prayers. A lot of royal announcements. But the Egyptians didn't do narrative history -- or if they did, we've never found it. They didn't write a lot of discursive philosophy. So on top of the rupture in the written tradition they also don't give us the kind of information we want when pondering "who was brilliant" or "who invented such and such" The same is true of other brilliant cultures: We don't know a lot of Sumerian scientists or Assyrian engineers by name. We likewise don't know who designed Notre Dame de Paris either. You don't get coffee table books if you live in a culture that doesn't record individual achievement or leave nice, literary records for subsequent societies to admire.
