It's a great tool, particularly if you're just getting started. It's still got a ways to go before it's competitive with the big, expensive custom C++ engines used in AAA games ( see [Why haven't any "big" games been released that use Unity?](https://www.quora.com/Why-havent-any-big-games-been-released-that-use-Unity) ) but for small-to-medium projects it's hard to beat. If you're just getting started you'll be able to do a lot before you run into serious Unity limitations.
