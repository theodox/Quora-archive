Well, quite a lot of them were.

Among the “greatest hits” collection of the Roman period, you’ll find such eminently Roman figures as:

Emperor [Septimius Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus) and his dynasty (there were additionally two unrelated, less famous North African emperors: Aemilian and Macrinus)

The comic playwright [Terentius Afer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence).

[Apuleius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apuleius), author of the picaresque Roman novel [The Golden Ass](https://literatureandhistory.com/index.php/episode-073-the-golden-ass).

The scholar [Fronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Cornelius_Fronto), beloved tutor of Marcus Aurelius.

The influential jurist [Salvius Julianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvius_Julianus), a key contributor to the codification of Roman law

A whole bevy of Latin Christian saints, including the influential bishop [Cyprian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprian), the apologist [Lactantius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactantius), and above all [Augustine ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo)— the single most influential writer in the Latin Catholic tradition before the Middle Ages.

It’s extremely difficult to view these (and the host of similar but less famous Roman-era North Africans) as anything other than “Romans.” since they all in various ways participated in the empire-wide culture of their days: Apuleius, for example, wrote a Latin novel set in Greece about a devotee of Isis, a cultural melange that is only comprehensible as part of the Roman imperial era. We can clearly see that older patterns of Punic and Berber life continued throughout the Roman period: Augustine, living in the fifth century, [spoke a little Punic](https://www.quora.com/Did-Saint-Augustine-speak-Berber/answer/Steve-Theodore) and his mother’s name was a Berber one. Although Latin inscriptions are the most common ones in the Roman era, Punic and Libyan or Berber ones are not hard to find. Nonetheless it was completely ordinary for a young North African like Augustine to go to Italy to study, or to join the imperial service or the army: there was no contradiction between being an African and a Roman.

It’s important to be clear about what we mean by “Roman” in this context. In the complicated imperial world this was a political and cultural identity, not an ethnicity. Most of the famous Roman North Africans above had varying combinations of mixed Punic, Berber, Libyan and “imperial” ancestry. Roman North Africa embraced Latin-language culture enthusiastically — it’s notable that the list above includes three of the most famous names in Latin literature — and intermarriages between all of the original populations of the region and newcomers from across the empire were common. Septimius Severus, for example, was descended from both Punic and Italian aristocrats. Although a large number of Roman veteran colonies were settled in North Africa (beginning around the time of Julius Caesar) these were never more than a substantial minority in the region: this was acculturation, not a population replacement.

In short — Roman North Africans were just as Roman as Roman Greeks, Roman Gauls, Roman Egyptians and Roman Britons. They formed a substantial part of the Latin-language culture of the empire, and were to be found all over the Roman world in both exalted and humble positions.
