A shekel was around 14 grams of silver. A Roman denarius of the same period was around 3.4 grams, making a shekel something like the equivalent of 4 denarii. A single denarius was a days wage of a laborer or a serving soldier. So, 30 shekels worth is about __four months income__ for a an ordinary day laborer — assuming we can generalize from our spotty knowledge of prices elsewhere in the empire during this period.

[The Herodian dynasty and the Roman procurators who replaced them didn’t mint silver in Judaea](https://www.academia.edu/40151943/Herodian_Bronze_and_Tyrian_Silver_Coinage) — they only minted low-value coins in Bronze. This might mean that the four month figure given above is too low: the scarcity of silver might have made it relatively more valuable in Judaea than elsewhere in the empire. The low denominations in circulation at the time definitely suggest a rather lower standard of living than in Italy or Egypt at the same time.

This coin is a silver shekel from around the right time — but it’s not Judean, it was minted in Tyre (the legend is TYPOY IEPAΣ KAI AΣYΛOY, “of Tyre the holy and inviolable.”) The only locally minted silver in Jesus’ lifetime consisted of [Jewish copies of these Tyrian shekels.](http://www.begedivri.com/shekel/J-Tyrian.htm) The temple authorities wanted the same purity level (95%) rather than the Roman standard of 80%, but lacked the legal right to mint their own silver coins. So, they sought Roman permission to make knockoffs (which involved no implication of political sovereignty) allowing them to continue to pay their traditional silver tithe with higher quality precious metal.

This meant, however, that the coins used to pay the temple tax during Jesus’ lifetime bore the image of the Phoenician god Melqart (at left, above). The faux-Tyrian shekels are often illegible and their images not clear, which might not be entirely accidental. In the tense atmosphere of first century Judaea it is unlikely that this irony went unremarked. Certainly, the various Jewish rebels of the late first and early second century would go on to mint their own distinctive silver coins, with no “graven images,” as soon as they had a chance.
