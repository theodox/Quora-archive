Here’s the full quote, for reference:

> Too black a hue marks the coward, as witness Egyptians and Ethiopians, and so does also too white a complexion, as you may see from women. So the hue that makes for courage must be intermediate between these extremes. A tawny color indicates a bold spirit, as in lions : but too ruddy a hue marks a rogue, as in the case of the fox. A pale mottled hue signifies cowardice, for that is the color one turns in terror. The honey-pale are cold, and coldness means immobility, and an immobile body means slowness. A red hue indicates hastiness, for all parts of the body on being heated by movement turn red. A flaming skin, however, indicates mania, for it results from an overheated body, and extreme bodily heat is likely to mean mania.

( [Physiognomonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiognomonics), formerly attributed to Aristotle ~ 300 BC) The only online version I can find in English is buried inside [this Project Gutenberg link.](https://archive.org/stream/worksaristotle00arisuoft/worksaristotle00arisuoft_djvu.txt)

The work it comes from is an early attempt at a materialist explanation of human character: trying to derive human behavior from what we’d describe as a chemical balance. The underlying pseudo-science here is an early version of the [theory of the four humors](https://schoolshistory.org.uk/topics/medicine-through-time/medicine-in-ancient-greece/theory-of-the-four-humours/), which claimed that human temperaments derived from balance between four basic bodily fluids: blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. Each one controlled a different set of emotions and behaviors:

On a faux-technical level, the idea is that Egyptians and Ethiopians are over-endowed with _melan choler_ , the “black bile” which is the ultimate root of our word _melancholy_ . Black bile is supposed to make you low-spirited and “intellectual” rather than active or physical — in non-ethnic contexts [Greeks used “melancholicos” for what we’d describe as PTSD](https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/black-bile-yellow-bile-an-essay-on-warrior-dysfunctionality-and-the-prehistory-of-greek-medicine/). As a point of comparison, the opposite stereotype was how the Greeks described their northern neighbors, the redheaded Thracians. These were too ruddy or tawny (ie, oversupplied with blood) which made them brave but undisciplined: in Aristotle’s _Politics_ he says “those who live in a cold climate and in Europe are full of spirit, but wanting in intelligence and skill”, or “too ruddy a hue marks a rogue, as in the case of a fox.”

This was pretty early in the development of the theory of humors, and even in the above quote you can see that there’s also a strong undercurrent of animal an analogies. Thus a few lines down from the quote above you get

> Grey or white eyes indicate cowardice, for we saw above that this is the signification of a white hue : but if they are gleaming rather than grey, they mean a bold spirit, as in lions and eagles. Goatish eyes mean lustfulness, as in goats : fiery eyes, impudence, as in dogs : eyes pale and mottled, cowardice, for in terror the eyes go pale with splotches of colour : glistening eyes, lasciviousness, on the analogy of the cock and the raven.

Skin color is on only one of the many physical indicators that the text uses to try to identify the physical expression of the basic constitution — all sorts of other things, from the shape of your nose to how hairy your arms are also provide “data” to the physiognomist.

Of course, this process is mostly just the process of matching of stereotypes to visible markers — we do it all the time today too, though nowadays its more likely to be the stuff of an unselfconscious tweet than a work of philosophy. The stereotype about Egyptians probably stems from a well-established Greek belief that character was determined more by _climate_ than what we’d call _race_ . Here’s a slightly older text called [Airs, Waters and Places ](http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/airwatpl.html)attributed to Hippocrates which gives the flavor in it’s description of Asia Minor but also mentioning Egypt.

> the country itself, both as regards its constitution and mildness of the seasons, may be said to bear a close resemblance to the spring. Manly courage, endurance of suffering, laborious enterprise, and high spirit, could not be produced in such a state of things either among the native inhabitants or those of a different country, for there pleasure necessarily reigns. For this reason, also, the forms of wild beasts there are much varied. Thus it is, as I think, with the Egyptians and Libyans.

For the Greeks, who had to import food, Egypt was the definition of abundance. So it’s likely that stereotyping Egyptians as cowardly comes from the very common Greek attitude that a mild, fertile climate rendered its inhabitants weak.

The stereotyping of _Ethiopians_ , on the other hand, is actually rather surprising: older Greek stereotypes about them were generally positive. For example in [Herodotus 3.21 ](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/3A*.html#31)(about two centuries before the Physiognomics) the Ethiopians are one of the few peoples who were completely uncowed by the Persians:

> It is not because he sets great store by my friendship that the Persian King sends you with gifts, nor do you speak the truth (for you have come to spy out my dominions), nor is your king a righteous man; for were he such, he would not have coveted any country other than his own, nor would he now try to enslave men who have done him no wrong. Now, give him this bow, and this message: 'The King of the Ethiopians counsels the King of the Persians, when the Persians can draw a bow of this greatness as easily as I do, then to bring overwhelming odds to attack the long-lived Ethiopians; but till then, to thank the gods who put it not in the minds of the sons of the Ethiopians to win more territory than they have.' "

I’d almost suspect that the _Physiognomica_ had this passage in mind and a copyist absent-mindedly swapped “Ethiopian” for “Libya.”



PS: If it helps, the many absurdities of physiognomy were always as obvious in antiquity as they are today.

> Do we not read how Socrates was stigmatized by the physiognomist Zopyrus, who professed to discover men’s entire characters and natures from their body, eyes, face and brow? He said that Socrates was stupid and thick-witted, because he had not got hollows in the neck above the collar-bone - he used to say that these portions of his anatomy were blocked and topped up: he also added that he was addicted to women - at which Alcibiades is said to have given a loud guffaw!
