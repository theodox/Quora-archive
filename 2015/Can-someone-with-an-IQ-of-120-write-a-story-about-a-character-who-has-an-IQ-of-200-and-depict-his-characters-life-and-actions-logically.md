It only has to be done well enough to convince people of average intelligence, so you can probably pull it off -- even though the results might not be very convincing to an actual 200 IQ genius. Logically isn't the problem: dramatically convincing is.

The most common dramatic trick for doing this is the "__Sherlock Holmes__ " trope, where the hyperintelligent character simple produces facts or correlations between facts that the reader would not know either from context or by extrapolating. 



> The train of reasoning ran, 'Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and this is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.'" 


This creates the appearance of great perception and cleverness, but it tends to work only in specific contexts: In real life, when somebody notices a spot of something on your shirt and proceeds to tell a detailed history of your career you tend to treat them as a crazy person rather than a genius. 

Another easy trick is to provide __uncanny predictive abilities__  -- which is quite difficult in real life, even for geniuses but is easy for a the writer who creates the characters and the plot. Maybe the classic example of this is Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle, which is full of 'genius' characters who spend a lot of time correctly predicting the future. It's a good trick but when overused it tends to get stale (I love Stephenson, but I found the Baroque Cycle very hard to slog through).


Finally, there's a lot to be said for simply providing characters with casual, conversational access to __verbiage most of us don't use__ or learn only with painful application. It works particularly well when the information is so esoteric that the audience can't easily evaluate your use of it. Simply dropping the right names in a casually fluid manner makes you look smarter: if I don't actually know that the hell a [Calabiâ€“Yau manifold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold) is, but I act like I do, how many readers are going to call me on it? The writer can research at leisure, but few readers will pause to double check the theoretical physics or historical details. It certainly helps if you do your homework, swapping in the time you do have for the extra brain power you don't. 

All that said, convincingly presenting genius characters is an extremely tricky literary task, since it's writing something you don't know from experience and which is hard to see from the inside.
