Now, he _might_  be saying “the temptation to outsource your homework is hard to resist,” but he could also be getting at the same thing as [What Your Superpower Might Say About You](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-second-noble-truth/201505/what-your-superpower-might-say-about-you). The same theme is also deeply entwined in HG Wells [The Invisible Man](http://www.bartleby.com/1003/).
