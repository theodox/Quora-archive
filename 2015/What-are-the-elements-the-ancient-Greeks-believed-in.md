Although we usually list the "four elements" -- as the other answers note, Earth, Water, Air and Fire -- there were actually a couple of additional candidates for a fifth slot. The English word "quintessence," which we use to refer to the essential nature of a thing, is a Medieval Latin term for the "fifth element" or q_uinta essentia._ 

Several Greek thinkers posited the existence of s fifth element, usually known as _[aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element))_ __ (αἰθήρ). The aether was the element which was associated with the heavens- part of its nature was to be more refined and more "perfect" than the familiar terrestrial elements. This helped explain the perfect regularity of the heavens, which made such a contrast with the chaotic and changeable conditions of the world we live in.

_At 12 0'clock fire (ignis) 3 o'clock air (aer) 6 0'clock water (aqua) 9 o'clock earth (terra) and in the center crowned (as befits the king of all elements) the aether. In between abstract qualities: dryness, wetness, heat and cold._ 

Aristotle thought the aether was a kind of fluid crystal -- it's frictionless flow moved the planets in their orbits. Later Greek astronomers and their medieval successors elaborated this idea a great length, creating the baroque -- but surprisingly mathematically accurate -- concepts that we usual call [the Ptolemaic universe](http://the Ptolemaic universe) , with its nested system of crystal spheres moving the planets though the heavens.


On the other hand [Plotinus](http://Plotinus) thought the aether was a kind of binding element -- the pure matrix in which the other elements combined to form the visible world. This idea was very influential in medieval alchemy, but it also ended up as the basis of much 18th and 19th century physics. The famous [Michelson-Morley experiment ](http://michelson-morley experiment)in 1878 was an effort to measure Plotinus' aether scientifically.

It's also worth pointing out that many Greek natural philosophers believed in only one element; for example [Thales](http://Thales) believed that water was the essential form of existence, while [Anaximenes](http://Anaximenes) believed that air played that role. The ultimate example of that idea is [Democritus](http://Democritus), who believed that all matter was just different combinations of tiny particles -- which he called "atoms" (roughly, "things you can't break down any further."
