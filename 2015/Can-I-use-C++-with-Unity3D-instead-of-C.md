You can write DLLs in C++. However the perf benefits of going that route in a Unity project will probably be offset by the productivity losses you'll get from trying to learn C++, C# and the Unity API all at once. 

If C++ is your priority you might want to look at [ Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/welcome-to-unreal-engine-4) or [OGRE](http://www.ogre3d.org/)
