If you’re thinking about political / military power, Egypt really started its terminal decline much, much earlier. The death of Rameses XI in __1070 BC__ marked the last time that a native-run Egypt would be a first class power in the ancient world.

After Rameses XI, Egypt fractured into feuding parts, which were vulnerable to outside powers. There were many short-lived efforts to re-unite the country, but from then on an independent Egypt would be an exception, rather than the rule.

__roughly 950 to 720 BC__ The [22d ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Dynasty_of_Egypt)and [23d dynasties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-third_Dynasty_of_Egypt) were descendants of the Meshwesh from Libya. However during this period the country was repeatedly disunited, and the priests of Thebes were the effective rulers on much of Upper Egypt.

__744 to 656 BC__ 
The [25th ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt)dynasty saw Egypt under the control of the Nubian kingdom of Kush. The Kushites were themselves pushed out by the [Assyrian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire).

__525 to 332 BC__ 

A [native dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Dynasty_of_Egypt) — originally put in place by the Assyrians as a puppet regime — only gained independence when the Assyrian empire imploded at the end of the 7th century BC. This kingdom was heavily dependent on Greek mercenaries to staff its armies; the first permanent Greek settlement in Egypt was created as a recruiting center and mercenary cantonment during this era.

However this new Egypt was conquered by the Persians in 525. For the next two centuries it would be mostly under Persian occupation — there were successful rebellions which interrupted Persian control but when Alexander arrived in 332 he was greeted as a liberator by the Egyptians who were overjoyed to see their Persian overlords humbled.

From then on Egypt would be under the Ptolemies and the Caesars for the next millennium. It remained a wealthy place (the Ptolemaic era, which created the hugely profitable Indian Ocean trade, was probably the most prosperous time in Egypt in since the Bronze Age) but Egypt would not be independent again for many, many centuries.
