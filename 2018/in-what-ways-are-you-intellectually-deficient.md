The nice way to talk about my besetting sin is “inattention to detail.” However, on closer examination, I’m afraid it slides easily over into hubris.

Inattention to detail might sound a little surprising if you only know my [nitpicky answers about obscure questions](https://www.quora.com/How-did-it-work-for-the-Romans-to-have-the-length-of-their-hours-vary-at-different-times-of-year/answer/Steve-Theodore), but that’s entirely a trick of electronic perspective. I hate getting caught out in obvious misstatements, primarily because it happens to me it _all the time_ in real life. So, when writing for public consumption I usually take the time to fact-check myself. In real life, where I don’t have the luxury of asynchronous communications, I am infuriatingly prone to oversimplifications, omission of key details, and a general failure to recognize when I am talking mush.

Maybe 10% of this is harmless absent-minded-professor comedy material. If I were a true child of the internet era, I’d attach a couple of choice voicemails from regarding, for example, my inability to deliver on the simplest of grocery lists or to remember which kid is where on a given evening. However, since I have a vestigial regard for quaint 20th century notions like “privacy,” you’ll have to take my word on that stuff.

The remaining 90%, however, is entirely unfunny.

My biggest strength and worst weakness are really two sides of the same thing: I’m _facile._ I’m good at picking up the vocabulary relating to a new subject. Unfortunately for me, verbal facility is not the same thing as apprehension: sounding like you know what you’re talking about is not the same thing as actually knowing it. Intellectually I’m aware of this — but emotionally I am constantly in danger of falling for my own vague, handwavey approximations.

A really good example is my love-hate relationship with linear algebra. I have to do a lot of math at work: computer graphics is built on matrix multiplication, trig, and sampling theory. But I’m a lousy mathematician: as a stupid teenager, before I had really recognized my Achilles heel, I pretty much skated by in math. Although I’ve more-or-less taught myself what I should have learned the first time, I’m unpardonably sloppy. I transpose operations, forget basic stuff (after all these years I still cannot properly factor a quadratic equation, and I constantly use sines for cosines and vice-versa). In that most damning of phrases, I know enough to be dangerous__ but _not_  enough to be trusted. At least I can rely on computers for the actual computing — when I have to do it on paper (say, helping the kids with math homework) I’m one step away from a random number generator.

And yet, despite all that,[ I end up trying to tell other people how to do math](https://theodox.github.io/2014/bagels_and_coffee.html). That is my problem in a nutshell.

Faking it to make it is a dangerous strategy. It’s particularly dubious if you are verbally adroit: when you are a quick study and a dab hand at cooking up plausible hypotheses on the fly, it is extremely tempting to start treating your ‘not bad for a beginner’ understanding of things as if it were gospel. I can size thing up quickly and come up with a reasonable sounding read in a jiff — but unless I am extremely careful (or my wife is on my case) I’m extremely prone to overlooking obvious details. “Ooops, I should have thought of that!” is what they’ll carve on my tombstone.

Now that I’m a grumpy old man, I at least know enough not to trust myself implicitly on anything which should be double-checked or gone over line by line. However that’s a poor substitute crispness and clarity.
