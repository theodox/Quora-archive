Anecdotally, at least, graphics programmers are probably the most sought-after specialists.

That field has split in the last decade: it used to involve the whole pipeline from engine to screen, but increasingly it seems like there’s a rare and sought-after sub-specialization for coders who understand the mysteries of graphics hardware and the non-intuitive ways you write for massively parallel graphics cards.

Keeping up with the churn in hardware and also changes in the graphics world at large requires a good deal of attention, so it’s quite hard for even a talented programmer in one of the other disciplines to switch over to graphics. Switching from, say, gameplay to AI or from animation programming to systems is fairly common as projects come and go; it’s much harder to cross the boundary between graphics and other disciplines.

On the other hand a lot of graphics programmers get frustrated when forced to work in the walled gardens of Unreal or Unity: it’s harder for them to find a job where they can really own a big system from end to end. This has, I think, encouraged a few of them to migrate to fields like ML/deep learning where their parallel-programming skills are well rewarded. This also depresses the supply and raises demand within games for people willing to accept the tyranny of the big engines.

So — for all these reasons good graphics programmers are in short supply in the games business. It’s hard to get good statistics but the pay scale for graphics gurus is noticeably higher than for generalists and gameplay programmers.

The flips side of this is, of course, the risk inherent in specializing in a field that has few applications outside games: a gameplay programmer who tires of games is still good at writing efficient, performant C++, which is useful in a lot of contexts. Mastery of HLSL or the Xbox shader compiler has fewer applications outside of games.
