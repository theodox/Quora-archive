If I had to pick just one from antiquity, I’d probably pick Plutarch.

Boswell, who knew a thing or two about biographies, called him ‘the prince of biographers.’ Most of the most vivid characterizations that have come down to use from antiquity are his — it’s not an accident that Shakespeare lifted not merely the incidents, but also the characterizations for _Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra,_ and _Coriolanus._ Historians sometimes complain that he is more interested in illustrating a moral observation or illuminating a persona than in dates, figures, and historical detail — but I sometimes think that’s jealousy, since Plutarch, though not precisely a historian, was widely and perceptively read in many sources we’ve lost, most notably the letters of Alexander and of Brutus. Unusually for a Greek he was an appreciative and sensitive student of early Roman history.

Above all, though, he’s just a good read: his characterizations are strong, his sense of moment is very dramatic, and his editorializing is humane and very direct — where many ancient authors are brilliant in ways that emphasize their otherness, Plutarch feels much less alien than, say, Thucydides and less otherworldly than Plato. Perhaps that’s because his influence is so wide: Renaissance ideals of Greek wisdom and Enlightenment allegiance to Roman Virtue were both illuminated by his depiction of the key moments of Greek and Roman history: Petrarch, Machiavelli, Montesquieu, Locke, Rousseau and Jefferson are all his godchildren.

Plus, his biographies are short enough to read on the bus. His [BrainyQuote](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/p/plutarch.html) page isn’t bad either. And in a very different vein his [De Iside et Osiride](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0239) is not very accurate Egyptology, but it’s the ultimate origin of a lot of Hermeticist, Roscicrucian, and New Age thinking and a fascinating look at what it was like to be a hippie 2000 years ago.

After that? Well, it’s harder and harder to rank. The good parts of Homer are unbeatable, though the formal requirements of oral epics — the catalogues and the repetition — are kind of wearisome if you got a tin ear for Greek meter like I do. Virgil’s Latin is almost as majestic as Homer’s Greek (and far less obscure). Aeschylus for _sturm und drang_ , but Sophocles for human-scale drama. Most comedy ages poorly, but Aristophanes’ _Frogs_  is actually heartbreaking in-between all the fart jokes. Herodotus is not a scientific historian but he’s more insightful than people realize — plus he’s just a great raconteur with a big trunk of great stories. Juvenal seems like a loathsome human being, but like lots of awful people his observations are perhaps more acute than those allowed to those of us who try to be nicer.
