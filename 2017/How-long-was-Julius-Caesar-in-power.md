Not very long, at least if you mean his time as sole ruler_._ 

Caesar crossed the Rubicon — that is, he essentially declared war on the Roman Republic — in early 49 BC; his troops occupied Rome that year. He defeated the main army of the Senate in the late summer of 48. He returned the Rome in 47, where he gave himself the title of _dictator perpetuus_ , essentially “ruler for life”. But he hadn’t actually defeated the last of the Senatorial die-hards; he was off to North Africa and then Spain to finish the job in 46 and 45. He returned to Rome in 44, and was assassinated on the ides of March that year.

So, at most his reign was just over 5 years; practically it was 4, and legally it was only 3.
