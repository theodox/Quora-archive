# If Jerusalem had been razed to the ground a thousand years ago, would there be less conflict in the modern world? Or would we have built new structures there, decided they were now holy and gone back to killing each other over them?

Jerusalem was [razed to the ground in September of the year 70, 1947 years ago](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0148%3Abook%3D7%3Awhiston+chapter%3D1%3Awhiston+section%3D1). In the words of Josephus, an eyewitness:

> NOW as soon as the army had no more people to slay or to plunder, because there remained none to be the objects of their fury, (for they would not have spared any, had there remained any other work to be done,) Caesar gave orders that they should now demolish the entire city and temple, but should leave as many of the towers standing as were of the greatest eminency; that is, Phasaelus, and Hippicus, and Mariamne; and so much of the wall as enclosed the city on the west side. This wall was spared, in order to afford a camp for such as were to lie in garrison, as were the towers also spared, in order to demonstrate to posterity what kind of city it was, and how well fortified, which the Roman valor had subdued; but for all the rest of the wall, it was so thoroughly laid even with the ground by those that dug it up to the foundation, that there was left nothing to make those that came thither believe it had ever been inhabited. This was the end which Jerusalem came to by the madness of those that were for innovations; a city otherwise of great magnificence, and of mighty fame among all mankind.

The “Old City” of Jerusalem is the leftover bits of the Roman city, [Aelia Capitolina](https://followinghadrian.com/2014/11/05/exploring-aelia-capitolina-hadrians-jerusalem/), which was built on the ruins about two generations later.
