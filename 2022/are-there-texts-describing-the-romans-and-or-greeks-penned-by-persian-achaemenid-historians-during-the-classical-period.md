No. If they ever existed, they are lost now. There are a scant handful of imperial inscriptions which mention the _Yauna,_ the Greeks, as tributaries but none of them is descriptive.

For a survey of what we do have:



There are a few much later sources — written during the Sassanian era, six or more centuries after the first Greco-Persian war; they are generally not very informative on the Achaemenid period. Sassanid texts are more perceptive about Roman matters but for them “Rome” is Constantinople. When these sources talk about Alexander the Great he’s “Alexander the Roman”.
