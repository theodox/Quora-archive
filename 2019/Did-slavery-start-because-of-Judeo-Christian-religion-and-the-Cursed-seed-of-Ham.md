__No.__ 

Besides the fact that slavery is historically one of the most common methods of social control — and that it is found all over the world in places where Judaism and Christianity were latecomers — we have plenty of evidence for slavery predating the existence of Judaism.

For example this:

is [a document of slave ownership from Jemdet Nasr, Iraq](https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/archival_view.php?ObjectID=P005289), the site of the Sumerian city-state of [Shuruppak.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuruppak) It records the fact that an owner named Gal-Sal had two slaves, Sukkalgir and En-Pap*.

The tablet is dated to about 3,100 BCE. For a [biblical literalist that’s actually before the supposed date of Noah’s flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_literalist_chronology#Abraham's_entry_into_Canaan_to_the_foundation_of_Solomon's_temple), and almost a thousand years before the birth of the first Jewish patriarch, Abraham (which literalists usually date to 2297 BCE). If you don’t like Biblical evidence, the oldest unambiguous evidence of anything we could call “Judaism” is probably the [Mesha Stele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesha_Stele) from about 850 BCE, more than two thousand years after Sukkalgir and En-Pap were enslaved.



_*sometimes transliterated ‘En-Pap-X’ or ‘En-Pap-?’ because of damage to the tablet._
