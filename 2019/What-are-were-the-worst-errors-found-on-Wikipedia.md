Well I was just about to say

> One of my very few wiki edits involved a claim on the page for [Lucius Cornelius Balbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Balbus_(consul)) that Balbus — one of Julius Caesar’s most prominent supporters — was “a Jewish financier”.

And I looked back at the page to just to check it today before posting this, only to discover this link at the bottom:

[Here Lies the Bible](https://books.google.com/books?id=bZakcrWPzeoC&pg=PA284&lpg=PA284&dq=lucius+cornelius+balbus+jewish&source=bl&ots=z3QsFN0T_8&sig=inKPrFitVU5HgOsLzLJuRFgEorU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9i4G82ubLAhUUUGMKHdatAesQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&q=lucius%20cornelius%20balbus%20jewish&f=false)

Which was the “documentary evidence” provided for the original claim. The actual claim has been removed (at least as of today) but it’s a good example of how far the tendrils of internet weirdness spread, even in areas where the cost-benefit ratio of spreading one’s goofy ideas is must be very low.

For the record there’s precisely zero evidence that Balbus (a citizen of Gades, in Hispania, probably of Punic origin) had anything to do with Jews or Judaism; in fact even the book, which looks like standard conspiracy fare, only says “his Jewish origins did not become an issue”. Looking at the edit history on the page I’m not sure if the fault is mine for failing to remove the orphaned link or if it somehow snuck back in.

But — for the record — it’s malarkey.
