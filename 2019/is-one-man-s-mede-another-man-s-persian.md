No — they’re actually two distinct groups who were not always that fond of each other despite being closely linked, particularly in the minds of other people. You might analogize the relationship to some of history’s more famous almost-but-not-quite pairings, like Spain and Portugal or Germany and Austria, or (in a fairly exact parallel) Kurds and modern Persians.

The Medes originated in what’s now western Iran; their capital city at [Ecbatana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecbatana) is in today’s [Hamadan province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamadan_Province), high in the Zagros Mountains. [Their language is not well attested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_language) but it was different from Old Persian; it’s usually classified in the Northwest Iranian language family, where the Old Persian of the Achaemenids was in the Southwest Iranian branch. One of the few known words of Median survives in English: _magu,_ the name for a priestly caste or tribe, eventually traveled west to become our “magus” and the root of “magic”. Modern Kurds sometimes claim descent from the Medes; Kurdish is also a Northwest Iranian language, but the extent of the real connection is highly debatable.

The Medes played a role on the fringes of Mesopotamian power politics. Western Media was conquered by the Assyrians, while the more mountainous regions hosted both bandits and traders: the road to the world’s primary source of lapis lazuli (in Badakshan, Afghanistan) passes through Median territory — the profits of that luxury trade may have helped the Medes to become a great power.

Around 700 BC the Medians united into a powerful kingdom under a leader whom the Greek historians call _[Deioces](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/deioces)_ . Deioces fortified the city of Ecbatana and united the Median tribes, who up until that point were primarily rural and semi-nomadic. For the Greek historian Herodotus, Deioces was the inventor of “oriental monarchy” — the autocratic, remote and semi-divine style of rule which the Persians later adopted and which the Greeks found both compelling and frightening.

Within a couple of generations the newly united Medians were powerful enough to overthrow the tottering Assyrian empire. Between 615 and 610 Median forces, allied with Babylon and Scythian steppe-nomads dismantled the Assyrian state which had dominated Mesopotamia for centuries. The Medes ended up with control of eastern Turkey, Armenia and all of northern Iraq). They also extended their power eastward and south into most of modern Iran.

There were Persians serving with the Median army which sacked the Assyrian capital at Niniveh. The Persian kingdom was centered in what’s now [Fars Province ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fars_Province)in southwestern Iran, though older Assyrian-era records place them farther north: possibly the rise of the Median state pushed them south. Babylonian accounts describe them, as “vassals” of Media.

From our limited sources it appears that Persians adopted a lot of Median cultural traits. The Magians who formed the religious caste in Media seem to have been respected in Persia as well, though there’s a lot of uncertainty about what Medians, Magians and Persians actually believed and practiced, and how it relates to the later history of Zoroastrianism. However they retained a sense of their own identity, which is very visible in art from the Persian period:

Relations were evidently close enough that the last Median king, [Astyages](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/astyages-the-last-median-king), married his daughter to the Persian vassal-king Cambyses. Herodotus gives a long and probably entirely fictitious account of what followed, but even if we can’t trust the details it does seem to show that the Persian upper classes were integrated into the Median state (which, by this time, had been the dominant regional power for more than a century and a half).

It was Cambyses’ son [Cyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great) who eventually overthrew Astyages (his own grandfather) and the Median empire. Herodotus’ version has a lot of fairy-tale elements but the core — a rebellion by the Persian vassal-king against the Medians — is attested in contemporary Babylonian sources. We can also see some truth in Herodotus’s account that the rebellion was fostered by the Median vizier [Harpagus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpagus): Babylonian records show that Astyages’ own troops handed him over to Cyrus.

Cyrus was more than a rebel; he was a political genius with a gift for conciliating defeated foes. Since Medes like Harpagus were vital to his own accession the new empire was more like a co-dominion than a wholesale replacement. Cyrus didn’t abolish the Median state, with its semi-divine monarchy, its centralized administration, and its Magian religion. Instead, he co-opted it, like the barbarian generals who donned the dress and titles and religion of Rome. Ecbatana remained the capital (though eventually Darius I built a second capital [Persepolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis), near modern Shiraz… probably for reasons which will be clear below).

Because the new Achaemenid empire retained so many Median trappings, western observers were often very careless about how they described it: a century later, when Xerxes invaded Greece, those who collaborated with the invaders guilty of Μηδισμός, “supporting the Medes” rather than Περσισμός, “supporting the Persians”. This fuzzy terminology remained traditional well into the Roman period even though the distinction between Persians and Medes was well known; a modern analogy might be the casually sloppy use of “British” and “English” as synonyms.

Linguistic and cultural ties don’t always trump politics. Although the Medes and Persians were both part of the same state, there were still important distinctions. The best example is mysterious career of the king known variously as [Smerdis, Bardiya, Mardos, or Gaumata](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bardiya-son-of-cyrus).

The traditional account is that (Persian) emperor Cambyses secretly murdered his own brother Smerdis before he headed off to conquer Egypt in 525 BC. However when Cambyses was off campaigning in Egypt, an impostor claiming to be Smerdis siezed the throne: in reality, however, this false Smerdis was actually a Magian —that is, a Mede —named Gaumata. Cambyses died while returning to confront the rebel, who became sole ruler in the summer of 522 BC. He ruled with the aid of a Median vizier named Patizeithes and, significantly, from a fortress in the famous horse-raising district of Media.

In the fall of 522, however, the Persian nobleman [Darius](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/darius-iii) organized a conspiracy with six other high-ranked Persians to overthrow the usurper. The story — [detailed at length by Herodotus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/3C*.html) — has several fairy-tale elements which raise suspicion but the fact that Darius overthrew “Gaumata”, who may or may not have been “Smerdis” or “Bardiya,” is clearly shown by [Darius’ own inscription at Behistun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_translation_of_the_Behistun_Inscription):

It may be that the aftermath of the (counter-)coup involved a permanent souring of relations between Persians and the Magians if not the rest of the Medes. Herodotus certainly thought so; he described both a slaughter of the Magians after Darius’ victory and an annual festival called the [μαγοφονια](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/magophonia) in which Magians were insulted and attacked. On the other hand some Magians continued to officiate in Achaemenid religious and court ceremonies down to the age of Alexander, so Herodotus may be misunderstanding something here.

To sum up: the Medes and Persians were distinct but their histories were closely intertwined. There’s a lot to ponder in the story of Smerdis and Darius, but the inference is clear enough: the Persians were quite self-conscious about their pre-eminent place in the empire. While they accepted Medes as a junior partners (just as the accepted Ionian Greeks, Babylonians, Elamites and many others) they saw themselves as distinct and superior even though they owed the Medes significant cultural debts.
