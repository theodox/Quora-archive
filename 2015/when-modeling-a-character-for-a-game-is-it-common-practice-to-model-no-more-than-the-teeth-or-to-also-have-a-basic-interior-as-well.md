# When modeling a character for a game, is it common practice to model no more than the teeth or to also have a basic interior as well?

This is a classic problem, and as [Glyn Williams](https://www.quora.com/profile/Glyn-Williams) answer notes it's not one the games do very well because it showcases several things that conventional skinning and rigging don't capture: the the sliding of skin over teeth, the combination of muscle bulging and skin stretching involved in making mouth shapes, and the different thicknesses and densities of different parts of the face. 

 In high end productions (mostly films, but also 'money-is-no-object' games like _Ryse: Son of Rome_  the developers use a much more elaborate combination of muscle systems, hand-sculpted morph targets, and special skin solvers that handle all of these thing more correctly. 






Even in high end productions it's pretty rare to get a detailed interior of the mouth (if you notice even in that Ryse cinematics reel there are few opportunities to really see into the character's mouth) but it's done sometimes for unusual images like big marketing screenshots or box covers.

If you're curious how it's done Jason Osipa's book [Stop Staring](http://amzn.to/1iFApdt) is an excellent introduction to facial rigging and animation.

For the modeling side proper you could check out [The Face: Modeling and Texturing](http://amzn.to/1imop0B) from Ballistic Publishing, who do a lot of great titles on high-end 3d modelling technique.
