Definitely not. Hieroglyphic signs are closer to their pictorial ancestors than most of the characters we are familiar with — but not always much closer:

A lot of the time hieroglyphs are used alphabetically, just like modern letter. There are also a lot of signs which stand for combinations of sounds, for example

can be the word _[nm](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Knife_(hieroglyph))_ , “butcher knife” but it also appears as the sound ‘nm’ in [ḫnms, ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%B8%ABnms#Egyptian)“friend” or sometimes you add it to another word that might be ambiguous when written down to indicated that the other word refers to something sharp. The [hieroglyphic writing system is very complex](https://www.quora.com/How-were-the-Hieroglyphics-deciphered/answer/Steve-Theodore) — it has hundreds of signs and most of them can be both symbolic or alphabetic depending on context.

The idea that hieroglyphs formed a completely symbolic system independent of any spoken language actually has a long history - it goes back at least as far as the Greek-language pseudo-expert [Horapollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horapollo), written about 1800 years ago, which claims to explain the symbolism of the hieroglyphs but which is almost always gibberish. People in the 1600’s were especially enthusiastice for the [‘pure symbolic’ approach to hierogplyphs](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-best-examples-of-symbolism-in-Europe), but now that we actually know how to read hieroglyphics they look pretty silly.

_A 17th century explanation of hieroglyphics (which claims to read them as a retelling of the Roman myth of Proserpina, an allegory of death and rebirth and the annual cycle of vegetation)._ 

_It’s dead wrong._
