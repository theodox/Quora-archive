No.

I think you’re confusing [Charlemagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne) :

with [Charlamagne Tha God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlamagne_tha_God)

Unless, perhaps, you’ve been misled by [this silliness](http://realhistoryww.com/world_history/ancient/Misc/Crests/History_of_the_Holy_Roman_Empire_2.htm), where they author wants you to think that’s Charlemagne on the right

If by some mischance you actually _need_  convincing, there is a contemporary color portrait of the emperor, from the Lateran Palace in Rome: that’s him at lower right (C_N CARULO REGI_ ). The square halo indicates the picture was done during his lifetime (and that of pope Leo, at left)
