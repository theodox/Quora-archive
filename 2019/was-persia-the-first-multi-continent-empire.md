No.

Egypt definitely wins the crown for “first multi-continent empire,” even though it’s a bit tricky to put a precise date on it; a conservative window would be between the reigns of [Thutmose I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_I#Military_achievements) around 1500 BC, and that of [Thutmose III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_III#Conquest_of_Syria) about 80 years later. The Egyptians tended not to take permanent direct control of conquered territories but they did routinely establish local protectorates and levy tributes, which still counts as imperialism by most definitions. This all happened about a millennium before Cambyses invaded Egypt. In the intervening time the Assyrians briefly held and inter-continental empire too, following their conquest of Egypt in 671 BC.

The Persians do however get an asterisk in the record books: their conquest of Egypt in 525 BC gave them a foothold in Africa, and their subjugation of “[Skudra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skudra)” — Macedonia and Thrace — around 500 also gave them a piece of Europe so they can fairly claim to be the first _tri-_ continental empire.
