Just hazarding a guess, I would imagine that it's probably lazy cartographers. If you start with the territory of modern Greece, the bounding rectangle of your map will include historic Ionia which is mostly to the west of Rhodes (It’d be worth asking which of these maps also include Cyprus). But it’s kind of lame, since some of the pivotal events of “Greek” history happened in Magna Graecia.

A ‘proper’ map of the Greek world for the classical era would be bounded on the north by the Crimea ([Olbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbia_(archaeological_site))), on the west by the eastern coast of Spain ([Empúries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emp%C3%BAries)), on the south by the Nile delta ([Naucratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naucratis)) and on the east by Cyprus.
