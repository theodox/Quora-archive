The ruling house in most of that period was a junior branch of the [House of Valois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Valois), so they were 'French' (to the degree you can really use that term). Presumably they were French speakers by virtue of that. The Burgundian region was part of the [Langues d'oÃ¯l](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langues_d%27o%C3%AFl), so it was more or less mutually intelligible with Old French. It's tough to really know, since there's very little specifically written in [Bouguinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundian_language_(O%C3%AFl)) and other regional dialects: the literary sources are dominated by the trunk-line from Old French to modern French.

In those days it wouldn't be particularly surprising for the upper classes to speak quite distinctly from their subjects. However it was more likely (especially over any significant stretch of time) for them to be able to speak one language among their own class and a different one in a different social context -- The lower members of the nobility, at the very least, still had be able to converse effectively with the ordinary folks who farmed their lands and ran their households. And, of course, the nurses who raised them as small children were not likely to be completely fluent in the speech of the upper classes: that kind of social polish would be achieved during education.

Later on the duchy passed to a branch of the Hapsburgs, who illustrate this principle neatly: it was said of Charles II of Burgundy -- who was also Charles V of Austria _and_ Carlos I of Spain -- that: .

> if it was necessary to talk with God, that he would talk in Spanish, which language suggests itself for the graveness and majesty of the Spaniards; if with friends, in Italian, for the dialect of the Italians was one of familiarity; if to caress someone, in French, for no language is tenderer than theirs; if to threaten someone or to speak harshly to them, in German, for their entire language is threatening, rough and vehement"
