Generally Romans were able to find lions within the empire, or from neighboring countries

In the early Roman period lions were still native to North Africa and Mesopotamia. It’s often stated that they were hunted to extinction before the end of the Roman empire in the west, but the [Barbary Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_lion) seems to have survived in Morocco (Roman Mauretania) and Algeria (Roman Numidia) until the 20th century. It’s possible the Barbary Lions were survivors of the population that dominated the Roman arenas, or that the [West African Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera_leo_leo) moved in to the habitats that the Romans had decimated — Barbary Lions were genetically more or less the same as their southern cousins.

The [Asiatic Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_lion) today survives only in India, but could still be found as far west as Iraq in the 20th century. In pre-Roman times they were common as far west as Palestine, but they Roman hunters reduced their numbers substantially. The Roman natural historian [Pliny](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D17), writing in the first century AD, passes along without comment a statement he attributes to Aristotle (four hundred years earlier) that particularly fierce lions could still be found in the mountains of northern Greece in his day — this could mean that lions were still to be found in Europe that late, or merely that he was collecting old sources without checking them.

Lions were only part of a large and sophisticated industry supplying exotic animals for the arena. You can get a sense from the mosaics in the [Villa Romana del Casale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Romana_del_Casale) in Sicily, a mansion from the early 300’s which is lavishly decorated with hunting scenes from Africa, including ostriches and antelopes as well as lions. The mosaics also show more exotic animals as well: tigers, rhinoceri, elephants and leopards.

_PS - a pedantic footnote: technically the folks who fought animals in the arena were not gladiators, but_ _[venatores](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/venatores.html)_ _, “hunters.” Or condemned criminals and political prisoners. Gladiators were had a somewhat higher status._ 

_PPS - extra pedantic footnote: Greeks generally did not go in for gladiatorial combat or animal hunt extravaganzas until the Roman period._
