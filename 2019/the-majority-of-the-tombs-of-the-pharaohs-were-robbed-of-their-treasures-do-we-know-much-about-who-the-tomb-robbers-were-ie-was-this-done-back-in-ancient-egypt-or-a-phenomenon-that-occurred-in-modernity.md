# The majority of the tombs of the pharaohs were robbed of their treasures. Do we know much about who the tomb robbers were ie. was this done back in Ancient Egypt or a phenomenon that occurred in modernity?

Tomb robbery has been going on almost as long as the tombs have been around.

This is the [Mayer Papyrus](https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/wml/collections/antiquities/ancient-egypt/item-295408.aspx), which is one of many Egyptian documents relating to the investigation of tomb robberies. It dates from about 1118 BC.

This was a serious problem for the Egyptian authorities. At least by this period there was a permanent bureaucracy which was intended to protect the tombs, investigate robberies, and punish violators. Crimes were investigated with great severity: this document notes

> As [the suspects] were brought to trial, the rack was applied to their hands and feet, to make them give an exact account of the manner of their crime

The investigations included on-site recreations of the crime and lengthy examinations (aided, as above, by beatings). The penalty for convicted tomb robbers was most severe: death by impalement.

__A first hand account__ 

Nonetheless, the rewards were great, so there were always some people willing to take the risk.

The confession of the tomb robber Amenpnufer, from the [Amherst Papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst_Papyrus) details a raid on a royal pyramid around 1100 BC and shows many of the classic hallmarks of tomb-robbery down the ages, including the gratuitous destruction of mummies.

> We went to rob the tombs as is our usual habit and we found the pyramid tomb of King Sobekemsaf, this tomb being unlike the pyramids and tombs of the nobles which we usually rob. We took our copper tools and forced a way into the pyramid of this king through its innermost part. We located the underground chambers and, taking lighted candles in our hands, went down.

> We found the god lying at the back of his burial place. And we found the burial place of Queen Nubkhaas, his consort, beside him, it being protected and guarded by plaster and covered with rubble.

> We opened their sarcophagi and their coffins, and found the noble mummy of the king equipped with a sword. There were a large number of amulets and jewels of gold on his neck and he wore a headpiece of gold. The noble mummy of the king was completely covered in gold and his coffins were decorated with gold and with silver inside and out and inlaid with precious stones. We collected the gold that we found on the mummy of the god including the amulets and jewels which were on his neck. We set fire to their coffins.

Breaking into a tomb required skill, patience and tools that most Egyptian’s did not have. Like many tomb robbers, Amenpnufer was a stone mason: he had both the construction experience and the metal tools necessary to break in to a tomb

More importantly, the Amherst papyrus account showcases the essential problem of protecting the tombs: sufficient loot could convince the officers of the law to look the other way:

> After some days, the district officers of Thebes heard that we had been robbing in the west and they arrested me and imprisoned me in the office of the mayor of Thebes. I took the twenty _deben_  of gold that represented my share and I gave them to Khaemope, the district scribe of the landing quay of Thebes. He released me and I rejoined my colleagues and they compensated me with a share again. And so I got into the habit of robbing the tombs.

The thief’s 20 deben of gold would have been about a pound’s worth. The total haul from this raid was a bit more than 30 pounds of gold.

__As old as the pyramids__ 

We don’t know exactly when the first official efforts to deter tomb robbers began.

In the earliest dynasties there’s some evidence that the Pharaohs themselves “reclaimed” items from older tombs in order to connect their own rule with that of revered ancestors. For example the pyramid of [Djoser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djoser), from the 27th century BC, includes artifacts from the first and second dynasties, though its not clear if these were taken from intact tombs or if this was some kind of restoration program for older tombs that had already been looted.

The problem was clearly well understood as far back as the 25th century BC, when the pyramids [include deliberate measures to thwart tomb robbers](https://www.sciencealert.com/how-ancient-egyptians-stopped-tomb-raiders-at-the-great-pyramid). The [Ipuwer Papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipuwer_Papyrus), a generalized lament for the the state of Egypt that was probably composed in the 19th century BC complains that at least one of the pyramids has been robbed:

> Behold, he who was buried as a falcon [is devoid] of biers, and what the pyramid concealed has become empty.

So they remained intact for no more than 500 years or so, and probably less.

It’s not impossible that tomb robbery rose and fell in different eras. Many of our sources relating to tomb robbers come from a relatively narrow window of time around 1100 BC. This was a period of acute economic distress all over the ancient world and may have made robbers more desperate.

__Countermeasures__ 

In any case, it’s clear that tomb robbery seen was a serious problem throughout Egyptian history.

By about 1500 BC, the pharaohs established the “funeral town” of [Set Ma’at](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_el-Medina), in the Valley of the Kings: a special community dedicated to building and maintaining the tombs. The workers there were well paid (relative to other Egyptian laborers) and were collectively responsible for the safety of the tombs. The town also hosted a garrison of [Medjay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medjay), elite paramilitaries who handled guard duty and law enforcement in the area.

However, the designated guardians sometimes gave in to temptation and robbed the tombs themselves. Many of our trial records concern citizens of Set Ma’at. Masons — like Amenpnufer — and smiths seem to have been particularly sought-after by tomb-robbing gangs, since they had access to the tools needed to actually breach the tombs. Those from Set Ma’at also knew the secrets of tomb construction and the various tricks which were intended to hide the real location of buried treasures from thieves. As we can see from the case of Amenpnufer, higher officials could also be bribed to look the other way.

Perhaps to counter the temptations of the local funerary establishment there were also — as we know from examples like the Mayer and Amherst Papyri — royal officials charged with protecting the tombs. Most of these seem to have been connected royal court rather than locals. Some of our evidence indicates that [different factions within the funerary community tried to find support from outsiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_Salt_124).

The most famous example of the royal commissioners at work is the tomb of king Tut. While we usually say that Tuthankamun’s tomb was found “intact”, it was in fact [looted twice within a few years of its completion ](https://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/tutrobbery.htm)— however it was repaired and restored on both occasions.

__A long tradition__ 

It’s safe to say that tomb robberies were always a feature of Egyptian life. There’s even some evidence that Egyptian folk tradition — as distinct from the official high culture — regarded tomb robbers as clever underdogs rather than sacrilegious criminals. The Greek historian Herodotus, who visited Egypt around the year 450 BC, records an Egyptian folktale about a [clever tomb-robber who outwitted the Pharaoh with his tricks and eventually married a princess](http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh2120.htm) (2.121) — an unlikely tale on many levels, but one which suggests that not all Egyptians saw tomb robbers as depraved.

Of course, history suggest that regular thugs outnumber dashing Robin Hood figures by a wide margin. Certainly the [modern version does not inspire admiration](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/06/looting-ancient-blood-antiquities/). In addition to desecrating the burials and ruining the archaeological record, antiquity-theft rings often use [forced child labor](https://www.livescience.com/55687-children-dying-in-egypt-looting.html) in the dangerous pursuit of treasures. Dozens of children have died in these illegal excavations in recent years, and robbers have gunned down guards who protect various sites.

Looting spiked after the 2011 Arab Spring protests in Egypt, and the situation has been slow to subside. For a notable example: just this year Egyptian airport X-rays detected mummy parts being smuggled out of the country [hidden inside these stereo speakers](https://www.livescience.com/64851-mummy-parts-recovered-airport.html):
