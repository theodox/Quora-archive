I'll just expand on [Assaph Mehr](https://www.quora.com/profile/Assaph-Mehr) 's answer to cover the later empire -- which, unusually, is better documented than the more famous period between Marius and Augustus, since we have some sources which are not exclusively dependent on aristocrats and politicians. 

According to the [Notitia Dignitatum ](http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/source/notitiadignitatum.asp)which is more or less an index of the military-industrial complex in the age of Theodosius (the last emperor whose writ ran from Syria to Scotland -- a bit before 400) the empire maintained arms manufacturing facilities in several key locations, such as the big military hubs at Antioch, Sirmium, and Augusta Treverorum and other nodal points; quite a few of the fabricae were located in cities that had were older legionary centers like Carnuntum -- this suggests that it may be an evolution of the older system in which individual legions maintained their own craftsmen and workshops. The system really began with Diocletian in the late third century; the tighter central control arms manufacture was part of his general effort militarize and centralize the economy. It may also have been a deliberate effort to keep strategic resources out of the hands of ambitious field commanders.

_A pretty faithful renaissance reproduction of the Notitia: this is a Roman coat of arms (or more precisely a departmental crest) for the Master of Offices (_ __Magister Officinum__ _) in charge of the_ __fabricae__ _. Note the prominence of mail shirts and shields._ 

There were also 'factories' or centers of cloth manufacturing for providing tunics, blankets and cloaks. However it's not clear that these were issued to all troops or that they constituted as 'uniform'

Arms inspectors were important officials. They were ultimately responsible to the Magister Officiorum, the highest administrator in the imperial bureaucracy but were directly controlled by [agentes in rebus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentes_in_rebus) , who were effectively the emperor's enforcers -- they were a powerful corps with wide ranging powers, sometimes described as the "secret police" of the late empire though that is stretching it a bit far: "commissars" might be a closer analogy. The fact that the fabricae were overseen by the agentes and not run-of-the-mill bureaucrats gives a pretty good idea of how important they were to the Roman state.

Interestingly the 'high tech' side of arms does not feature prominently in the Notitia (although we know the Byzantines managed to maintain the secret of Greek Fire for a long time; the omission may be deliberate). Only 2 of the 35 _fabricae_ manufacture ballistae. Shields and armor predominate -- at this period, primarily mail and helmets that you'd probably mistake for Norman gear (although the [clibanarii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clibanarii) wore full plate armor) . The Romans did maintain export controls on armor as well but there's no evidence that they did so for swords -- armor was harder and more expensive to produce. Swords on both sides of the border were similar in style and quality anyway -- the late Roman swords were probably in fact 'borrowed' from German models, replacing the old legionary gladius with something closer to a Viking or Norman longsword.

Although the factories weren't 'factories' in our sense and they did not use anything like interchangeable parts, the Roman military had always embraced standardisation and this continued down to the end of the western empire. Shields, helmets, and even guard towers were built to standard plans -- not always at the highest peak of quality but decent and repeatable: you can see very similar towers on Hadrian's wall, up the Rhine and down the Danube. The ideology of the tetrarchy and the Constantinians seems to have embraced a kind of uniformity as well; the famous example of the tetrachs in Venice is anothe example:

_Standardization on the ideological level, ca. 285_ 

Although the Late Roman army gets a bad rap, they were pretty successful professionals working in a long, self-conscious tradition. Writing around the same time as the _Notitia_ , [Vegetius](http://www.digitalattic.org/home/war/vegetius/index.php#intro)  gives some examples of how important logistics was to the late-Roman army:

> The legion owes its success to its arms and machines, as well as to the number and bravery of its soldiers. In the first place every century has a balista mounted on a carriage drawn by mules and served by a mess, that is by ten men from the century to which it belongs. The larger these engines are, the greater distance they carry and with the greater force. They are used not only to defend the entrenchments of camps, but are also placed in the field in the rear of the heavy armed infantry. And such is the violence with which they throw the darts that neither the cuirasses of the horse nor shields of the foot can resist them. The number of these engines in a legion is fiftyfive. Besides these are ten onagri, one for each cohort; they are drawn ready armed on carriages by oxen; in case of an attack, they defend the works of the camp by throwing stones as the balistae do darts.

> The legion carries with it a number of small boats, each hollowed out of a single piece of timber, with long cables and sometimes iron chains to fasten them together. These boats, joined and covered with planks, serve as bridges over unfordable rivers, on which both cavalry and infantry pass without danger. The legion is provided with iron hooks, called wolves, and iron scythes fixed to the ends of long poles; and with forks, spades, shovels, pickaxes, wheelbarrows and baskets for digging and transporting earth; together with hatchets, axes and saws for cutting wood. Besides which, a train of workmen attend on it furnished with all instruments necessary for the construction of tortoises, musculi, rams, vines, moving towers and other machines for the attack of places. As the enumeration of all the particulars of this sort would be too tedious, I shall only observe that the legion should carry with it wherever it moves, whatever is necessary for every kind of service so that the encampments may have all the strength and conveniences of a fortified city
