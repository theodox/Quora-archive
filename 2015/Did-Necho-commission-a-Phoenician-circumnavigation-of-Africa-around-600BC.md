It's not inherently impossible, but I don't believe there are any original sources beyond the original mention in Herodotus 4.42. Necho was not too far removed from Herodotus for some word to have come down through Greek or Egyptian sources: his father [Psamtik I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psamtik_I) (Psammetikos) had a lot of dealings with Greeks, using Greek mercenaries to fight the Assyrians; in fact he he figures in a separate Herodotus story. 

 The best argument in favor is the 3-year figure, which is not a bad estimate for coastwise-crawling in unknown waters in those days, particularly if the sailors are stopping to grow their own food as in the story. [Strabo's Geography](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2C*.html) ( 2.3) quotes a story about a later Greek navigator named Eudoxus who tried the same trick in the other direction and also planned on planting corn, but who had to turn back. Strabo does not believe the story, however, and the bit about planting corn could be a literary echo and not real evidence.

Here's a very nicely embellished account of what the Phoenician trip might have been like, but AFAICT everything is conjectural: [The first circumnavigation of Africa](http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodotus/hist01.htm)

On the negative side, you might expect some mention (however garbled) of the unusual sights of the Cape of Good Hope -- the Rock, penguins, sea lions, or maybe the existence of Madagascar -- to have come back in some form. However that's just a guess. There's not much conclusive evidence either way.
