# People are complaining about the sight of a black Roman legionnaire in the trailer for the new show "Britannia". Personally I imagine that black legionnaires were nothing special in a multicultural and multiracial Roman army. Who is right?

I’ve answered this in more detail here: [Did the Roman Empire recruit/have black soldiers, if so how many did it have?](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Roman-Empire-recruit-have-black-soldiers-if-so-how-many-did-it-have)

The TLDR is that sub-Saharan Africans would be _very_  rare in the Roman world, though not completely unheard of. The horn of Africa was pretty much all the Romans knew apart from the Mediterranean littoral. If the actor was, say, from Somalia it would not be bad casting; if he’s from Nigeria, it’s sloppy research. Tunisians or Moroccans, on the other hand, would be completley routine for 43 AD — although not as ‘legionaries’ : they’d be auxiliary cavalry or skirmishers.

Nominally at least legionaries — the classic Roman infantry with big tower shields, javelins and swords — were only recruited from among citizens. In 43 that would make most them from Italy, Spain, the Romanized parts of North Africa, and Asia Minor with a smattering of everybody else in the Mediterranean. Specialist auxiliary units tended to be from distinct locales with their own traditions — Numidian cavalry from North Africa, slingers from the Balearic Islands, archers from Syria, etc. These outfits would get more and more cosmopolitan over time but at that date they would be pretty homogeneous.

For what it’s worth, the 4 legions in Britain from the time of the invasion of 43 to the Boudiccan war of 60 were all raised in Europe. II Augusta was from the Sabine region of Italy; XIV Gemina was from Gaul, IX Hispana and XX Valeria Victrix were both from Spain. Their service kept them mostly on the Rhine or the Danube before going to Britain. There’s not much information about the auxiliaries for that period. Later, Hadrian’s wall would host Syrian archers but [almost all the other units stationed there were from north-west Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_auxiliaries_in_Britain); that’s still in the future at the time of the show, however.

The Roman general who put down the Boudiccan rebellion had actually led on of Rome’s furthest southward expeditions — in 41 he chased bandits over the Atlas Mountains until he reached the western Sahara and gave up. He’d also been the prefect of Egypt. So it’s actually a lot easier to imagine somebody from the far south on his staff than serving as a legionary.
