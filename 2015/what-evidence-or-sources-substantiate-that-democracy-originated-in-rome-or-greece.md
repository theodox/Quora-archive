If you're asking "was there democracy in Ancient Greece", there's an overwhelming amount of evidence: we have accounts of [speeches delivered to the people](http://www.bartleby.com/268/1/16.html), of [famous jury trials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Socrates), and [intense debates](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D36) along with their outcomes. We have lots of [philosophical arguments about the merits of democracy](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D3%3Asection%3D1281a) (pro and con - it was always a controversial form of government in the ancient world). The [development of Athenian democracy](http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_democracy_development?page=3) is very well documented. The Roman model was even better documented, at least in Western Europe where Latin remained a living language into the 19th century. Rome was a republic, rather than a democracy, although the Roman system included some democratic elements including direct legislation by the citizenry (see [How did the Roman republic differ from Athenian democracy?](https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Roman-republic-differ-from-Athenian-democracy))

As for the transmission to us: Our word "democracy" is a literal rendition of the greek _demokratia_ (almost all of our political vocabulary, from "politics" to "republic" to "legislation" to "election" comes from Greek and Roman sources). Greek philosophical works were partly lost after the fall of the Roman Empire, but revived in the west after the 11th century, first from Arabic translations and later by rediscovery and translation of the originals. Histories were re-discovered during the Renaissance. Discussions of democracy in Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, Polybius, and many other authors were well known by the 16th century, and in the 18th century formed an important part of the emerging discussion of political alternatives to Monarchy. Enlightenment thinkers like Locke, Rousseau, and Montesquieu -- as well as the framers of the American Constitution -- were well schooled in the history of the Classical period, although almost all of them preferred the [mixed government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_government) theory of Aristotle and Polybius to the direct democracy at Athens.
