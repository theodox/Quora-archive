Not routinely. Most Greeks regarded the practice with horror, a mark of barbarism.

However, there were a small number of examples in times of crisis — most famously, during the Persian invasion in 480 BC, where Plutarch (in _[Themistocles, XIII.2](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Themistocles*.html)_ )records that Greeks insisted on sacrificing a set of Persian captives on the eve of the battle of Salamis:

> three prisoners of war were brought to [Themistocles], of visage most beautiful to behold, conspicuously adorned with raiment and with gold. They were said to be the sons of Sandaucé, the King's sister, and Artaÿctus. When Euphrantides the seer caught sight of them, since at one and the same moment a great and glaring flame shot up from the sacrificial victims and a sneeze gave forth its good omen on the right, he clasped Themistocles by the hand and bade him consecrate the youths, and sacrifice them all to Dionysus Carnivorous, with prayers of supplication; for on this wise would the Hellenes have a saving victory. Themistocles was terrified, feeling that the word of the seer was monstrous and shocking; but the multitude, who, as is wont to be the case in great struggles and severe crises, looked for safety rather from unreasonable than from reasonable measures, invoked the god with one voice, dragged the prisoners to the altar, and compelled the fulfilment of the sacrifice, as the seer commanded.

And in some places the line between sacrifice and criminal punishment was blurry:

> in Rhodes, on the sixth day of June, a man was sacrificed to Saturn; which custom having prevailed for a long time, was afterwards changed [into a more human mode of sacrificing]. For one of those men who, by the public decision, had been sentenced to death, was kept in prison till the Saturnalia commenced; but as soon as this festival began, they brought the man out of the gates of the city, opposite to the temple of Aristobulus, and giving him wine to drink, they cut his throat.

_[Porphyry, On Abstinence from Animal Food, II.54](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_abstinence_02_book2.htm)_ 

The same writer goes on to list a few other examples, some of which survived into the Hellenistic period.

There was also illegal human sacrifice, usually done for magical purposes out of sight of the official civic religions. Plato, for example, was aware of rumors that human sacrifice was still being practiced in the wilds of Arcadia (one of the more remote and mysterious parts of Greece) in his own time;[ recently archaeologists think they may have found evidence to confirm this.](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/10/skeletal-remains-confirm-ancient-greeks-engaged-in-human-sacrifice)

So: human sacrifice was generally not a regular feature of Greek life. But it was not entirely unknown.
