Legitimate is a loaded word here. The Ottomans were foreign conquerors; they destroyed the Byzantine state and subjugated it's people. The sultans had about the same right to the title "Caesar of Rome" as queen Victoria had to "Empress of India". 

For what it's worth, the Byzantines were never completely committed to the idea of hereditary succession. It was a rare enough phenomenon that they had a special term, porphyrigennitos, for the subset of emperors who did assume the throne as direct heirs of a reigning emperor.
