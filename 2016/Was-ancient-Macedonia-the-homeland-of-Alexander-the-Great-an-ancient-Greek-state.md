Not a polis, which is a city-state. Macedonia had a few cities but it was an anomaly in the Greek world: a kingdom rather than a republic, and a territorial state rather than a city -state. There were a couple of urban settlements in the Macedonian heartland, but the Macedonians were rural people: the city-state Greeks tended to look down on them as country bumpkins.

_This gives a good idea of the distribution of cities in Greece. Only Aigai (a city mostly by courtesy) and Pella are Macedonian, at least before the Macedonians began poaching the southern Greek colonies in Chalcidice._ 

The Greeks were also a bit dubious about Macedonia’s politics. Real kingdoms (as opposed to temporary tyrannies set up by successful adventurers) were very rare in Greece; Sparta is the only famous example, though there are a few more obscure ones. Macedon in a lot of ways was a throwback: the kings ruled in the midst of a semi-feudal levy, almost like the heroic figures in Homer — a style which evoked a mix of admiration and disdain from city-state Greeks.

The trappings of civilization tended to center on the royal palaces: the old Macedonian capital at [Aigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vergina) was barely a city, but the wealthy kings did bring famous artists and poets from the rest of Greece to bolster their cultural credentials. [Pella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pella) eventually grew into a large, prosperous city — but that was really only after the Macedonians had begun to dominate Greek affairs.

Macedonia’s place in the Greek world was ambiguous. Macedonia was, after all, a Persian vassal for a while and played a complex double game during the Persian invasion. Macedonian aristocrats affected Greek manners and spoke Greek, but they also intermarried with the upper classes of the barbarian kingdoms to their north and west: Alexander’s father Philip married both an Illyrian princess and Thracian one (who, following her native custom, killed herself after Phillip’s death to accompany him to the underworld — thrilling and scandalizing Greek observers). Alexander’s own mother, Olympias, was a Molossian — another frontier kingdom that Greeks from the city states regarded as half-barbarous at best.

For all these reasons the Macedonians worked hard to gain acceptance as ‘real Hellenes’ despite some notable opposition. Alexander I had fight to be allowed to compete in the Olympics (open only to Hellenes). His notable sponsorship of poets like Pindar was part of a very public effort to advertise his Greek credentials. The Athenians, in particular, disdained Macedonians and occasionally referred to them as ‘barbarians’ — though of course the Athenians, who lost several colonies to the Macedonians in the 4th century BC had reasons of their own for the name-calling apart from ethnic purism.
