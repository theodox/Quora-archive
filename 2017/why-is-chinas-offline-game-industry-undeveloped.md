There's actually quite a lot of development in China, but the offline version (at least, the part that doesn't go through a locked App Store) has a hard time making money. It's really difficult to get customers to pay for software all over Asia, but particularly in China. And in China the console market has developed slowly , mostly because of protectionism, so you can't rely on consoles as a harder-to-copy form of conventional sales.

Online games — which are booming in China— are much easier to monetize: copying the bits doesn't matter if you can't play without a server account.

The low-retail environment also encourages different types of games overall—F2P games evolved as a way to lure customers who would not part with full retail money to essentially purchase a game in small, affordable pieces. It's clearly taken on a life of its own now, but in the end it's an adaptation to the huge problem of selling software successfully in Asian markets and particularly in China.
