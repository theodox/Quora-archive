Pretty much yes -- the word viking comes from _vikingr,_ which literally means "pirate", "raider" or "freebooter". [Online Etymology Dictionary](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=viking)

 Used as a descriptive term it's actually very modern - contemporary writers would just describe the folks who showed up to burn, loot and pillage by their tribal or national identity: the Danes, the Scylds, etc. 

One important distinction is that the the vikings were really more like the seafarers of the mediterranean before the 6th BC, or the sailors of the Malay archipelago in before the 19th c: in all 3 cases the behavior was pretty much "fight anybody weaker than yourself, run from anyone stronger, and trade with equals." There would not be much distinction between a trader and a pirate apart from circumstance. Preying on your immediate neighbors was considered bad form, but if you showed up after a long voyage with a lot of gold and slaves you were more likely to be praised for your daring than condemned for your greed and violence. I'd assume that within that broad category some vikings inclined much more to the peaceful and others to the warlike sides of the spectrum, but the lines we would draw today between a pirate and a trader were at best very fuzzy.

They weren't "just" pirates in that they had some great technical abilities; they were the greatest open-water sailors of their day, excellent shipwrights, talented navigators, and in their own way they were regarded as fairly honest. Byzantine emperors, for example, preferred vikings ([Varangians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varangians), mostly from Kievan Rus) as bodyguards, finding them both fierce fighters and more loyal than locals. They were also known for high quality steel. 

When the French kings allowed former vikings to settle down in Normandy, they adapted to the feudal system very quickly -- they turned from pirates into (depending on how you choose to look at it) aggressive imperialists or successful feudal lords: they founded the modern kingdom of England, and conquered Sicily, Naples, and lots of other places around the mediterranean, both as crusaders and on their own.
