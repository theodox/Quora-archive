The best imaginative work on this topic is Gene Wolfe's__Soldier in the Mist__  series, which nowadays comes as a lopsided pair: [Latro in the Mist](http://www.amazon.com/Latro-Mist-Gene-Wolfe/dp/0765302942/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436760605&sr=8-1&keywords=latro) covers the first three books and [Soldier of Sidon](http://www.amazon.com/Soldier-Sidon-Gene-Wolfe/dp/0765316706/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_y) covers the conclusion. 

The narrator is Latro, a Roman mercenary who fought in the service of the Persian empire during Xerxes' invasion of Greece. He is cursed with a peculiar form of amnesia: his short term memory is intact but he can't remember anything over the long term (this idea was stolen for the movie [Memento](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/)). However his condition also allows him to see and interact with the hidden world of the Greek gods, and much of the story concerns his unwilling participation in a series of complex and obscure power struggles between different Olympians. 

The series manages the difficult feat of being a good adventure story and good literature at the same time: you've got magic, derring-do and battles but also an unreliable and often confused narrator and multiple contradictory views of the same event. 

Wolfe does a brilliant job of de-familiarizing the classical imagery and names: reminding us that those stories and the world-view behind them are as alien to us as any tales brought back by anthropologists from the most distant corners of the world. It's a brilliant imaginative reconstruction of the way it would feel to live in an Olympian world: the wonder, the terror, the beauty and the bright hard pitiless glare of the those old stories --- so different from the comfortable domesticated 19th century mannequins staring out from the facades of every courthouse or gilded-age train station.
