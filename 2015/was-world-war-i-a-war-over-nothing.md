Many great answers, particularly those by [Carey Sublette](https://www.quora.com/profile/Carey-Sublette) and [Samuel Byers](https://www.quora.com/profile/Samuel-Byers-1). 

I'd just add that our image of the war is heavily colored by the politics of the inter-war period. The incomprehensibly awful experiences of the trenches, of course, convinced many that nothing could be worth such sacrifices -- but not everybody felt that way. The majority of veterans were proud of their service and felt that they had done their duty, or even that they had saved the world from a terrible fate. Many of the people at home felt the same.

However the war marked a new phase in European history off the battlefield too. The tensions between the working class and the elite were heightened by the chaos and privations that followed the war and also by the rise of the Soviet Union which provided what looked back then like a new and better alternative way to run the world. Moreover the old elites were terribly weakened: not only did they [die in great numbers](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world-war-1/453259/The-lions-were-not-led-by-donkeys), the combination of post-war chaos, the vindictiveness of the post-war settlement, and the rise of the Soviet Union created a huge challenge to the legitimacy of old empires. 

The idea that the war was a giant scam or a terrible folly had natural appeal to critics of the old order, and they worked hard to portray it that way. The image of a foolish war run for venal purposes was, ultimately, more popular among writers of the [Lost Generation](http://writersinspire.podcasts.ox.ac.uk/content/lost-generation), who grew up in the chaotic post-war world without themselves having suffered through the horrors of the trenches than it was with the survivors of the war. Of course, no 'generation' is a monolith: some of the seminal works which defined the popular image of the war were written by veterans (for example, [All Quiet on the Western Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front)). However others were written by younger writers: the author of [Johnny Got His Gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Got_His_Gun), for example, was 13 when the war ended (and that book was serialized in _The Daily Worker_ ). 

The popular image of futility and madness (the [Blackadder Goes Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackadder_Goes_Forth) view, which still has a lot of mindshare) really rests less on first-hand testimony than on the feelings and opinions of the late twenties and thirties. Even for people who didn't follow the Communist line -- that the war was a natural outgrowth of capitalism -- the idea that the whole thing had de-legitimized traditional European values resonated very widely -- not just in the immediate aftermath of 1918 but in the Depression as well. The outlook of the disillusioned view is best summarized in [The Great War and Modern Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_War_and_Modern_Memory) -- a powerful book, but one which was criticized as simply ignoring evidence which didn't fit into the idea that the war was the 'death of the old world and the birth of the new'. 

How much of this is rational analysis, and how much is the rough-and-tumble of inter-generational politics (as well as regular politics) is hard to say. In the end, then, the opinions of the participants were split; those of later generations were shaped as much by the politics of the interwar years as they were by the actual facts of the war itself. 

If you've ever listened to _And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda_ 




you'll see both sides: the narrator is bitter and sees it all for nothing, but his comrades are still marching proudly in the ANZAC day parade.
