Unfortunately we don’t know for sure: our example corpus is quite small, and doesn’t include anything over 1,000.

The system for smaller numbers is pretty simple, with only 3 symbols for 1s, 10s, and 100s, using duplication for tallying and placing the larger values on the left. It seems like Persians used both thousands and myriads (10,000) as common organizational numbers so it’s likely there were glyphs for those at least — but until we find an example, we don’t know what they were.

_An example of Old Persian numerals we’re sure about_ 

OP cuneiform was invented by a state that relied heavily on Elamite for administrative documents (Elamite is far, far more common in Achaemenid documents than OP) and the glyphs for 1 and 10 are the same as Elamite. So it’s _possible_ that the creators of OP cuneiform used 𒅆 (the cuneiform glyph “lam”) for 1000 and 𒉿(“pi”) for 10,000 — [those are what Elamite used,](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/doc/help/languages/elamite/index.html) along with a similar tally system. However, that’s just a guess and we’d have to find an Achaemenid-era document to be sure.
