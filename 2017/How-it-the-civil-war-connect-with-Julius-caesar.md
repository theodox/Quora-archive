Caesar was an expert in civil wars: he [survived two as a child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla%27s_civil_wars), and as an adult [he started and then won one of his own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_Civil_War). He literally [wrote the book on the subject](http://classics.mit.edu/Caesar/civil.1.1.html).

It is, however, also true that the southern slave-ownersâ€™ habit of naming their slaves ironically after figures from ancient history led to some interesting results. There were no fewer than [15 Julius Caesars in the armies of the Republic](https://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?rank=1&gsln=Caesar&gsln_x=XO&db=NPS_civilwarsoldiers&gss=genfact&_F0003CA4_x=1&uidh=000&_F0003CA4=), almost all of them in the U.S. Colored Troops. And this time they were fighting for the legitimate government. Not even Bobby Lee can take on 15 Julius Caesars at once.
