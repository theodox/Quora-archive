Roman ship naming didn’t have hard and fast rules, though there were a few big categories of names. Divine names like _Mars_  (and, interestingly, non-Roman divine names like _Isis_ or _Hermapollon_ ) were pretty common. So were semi-divine abstractions like _Concordia_ (= “harmony”), _Pax_ (= “peace”) or _Fides_ (= “loyalty”). River names (_Tiber, Nylus)_ were another popular choice. Sometimes a ship-captain would curry favor by adopting the current emperor’s favorite cognomen — for example there was a quadrireme based at Misenum named _Dacicus_  after Trajan adopted that title for his victory in the Dacian war.

Here’s a list of Roman [ship names from the Roman fleet at Misenum](http://www.ulixes.it/italiano/i_pg01.html?http://www.ulixes.it/italiano/i_pg02afr06a.html), on the bay of Naples:
