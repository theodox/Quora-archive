I don’t believe there’s any evidence for contact in Latium or central Italy at all — from a Minoan perspective these weren’t attactive destinations.

The Minoans definitely had the wherewithal to make it to the western Mediterranean: there are some faint traces of Minoan artifacts as far west as Sardinia. The widest spread potential evidence are the distinctive [oxhide copper ingots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxhide_ingot#:~:text=The%20earliest%20oxhide%20ingots%20found,1500%20BC%20to%201450%20BC.&text=The%20copper%20trade%20was%20largely,the%20coast%2C%20and%20on%20islands.): most of these appear to be of Cypriot origin but they include samples from other sites too, including Israel and the Sinai. Sardinia has native copper of its own, yet even in the Bronze Age there were competing streams of commodities criss-crossing the Mediterranean.

Sardinia also shows examples of both Cretan and Cypriot pottery, further evidence of its connection to the Minoan world. And, it’s worth noting, that classical legends attributed the [Nuraghe,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuraghe) the enigmatic stone towers which dot the island, to Daedalus — the builder of King Minos’ Labyrinth. And Minos himself is said to have died in Sicily, where [he was killed while pursuing the runaway Daedalus](https://www.explorecrete.com/mythology/daedalus-sicily.html).

There are Minoan finds in Sicily and the Lipari Islands.

However Minoan artifacts are rare in Italy proper.

This almost certainly reflects the fact that the driving force in Bronze Age trade was the endless search for sources of tin, a vital ingredient for bronze but extremely rare in the eastern Mediterranean. Mesopotamia got it’s tin overland, from Afghanistan; Crete and Cyprus had to look west. Sardinia had small sources of native tin — but, as a local center of copper mining (with valuable silver and lead as well), it participated in the tin trade network that passed up through France towards the mines of Cornwall and Brittany. Since we don’t find Minoan or Cypriot goods in Europe proper, we can guess that [Sardinia was a key transshipment point connected northern and western European tin to markets in Crete and Cyprus.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10426914.2020.1758329)

Central Italy, in this period, didn’t contribute much to this remarkable international trade and didn’t attract a lot of attention from the economic powers of the Near East until the Iron Age. The future site of Rome was not of great size or economic importance in the Bronze Age — the most populated part of the Italian penninsula was the Po Valley, which seems to have also been a node in the Mediterranean trade network connecting central copper and Baltic amber to the Mediterranean economy:

It’s worth noting that the traditional founding date of Rome — 752 BC — is about seven centuries after Mycenaeans Greeks conquered Crete. Even the legendary arrival of Aeneas and the Trojan refugees would be roughly contemporary with the last traces of Minoan culture in Crete.

So, all told, it’s not surprising that the Minoans passed up on visiting lightly populated Latium.
