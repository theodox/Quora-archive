[Nabonidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabonidus), the last Babylonian king. was not popular. He was a usurper who had dethroned the previous king. It appears he was ethnically an Assyrian, not a Chaldean (that is, an ethnic Babylonian) — he seems to have made a point of tying himself to the memory of [Ashurbanipal,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashurbanipal) the last of the great Assyrian emperors. Chaldean Babylonia was not fond of Assyrians — it was the Chaldeans who organized the revolts which overthrew the dreaded Assyrian empire two generations before. Nabonidus made a point of elevating other deities — particularly the moon god [Sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_(mythology)) — over Babylon’s patron deity [Marduk.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marduk)

Nabonidus was not actually resident in Babylon for most of his reign — he spent a lot of time in the Syrian desert at [Tayma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayma), leaving his son (the biblical [Belshazzar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belshazzar)) as governor of the city. The Babylonians presumably resented the absence of the royal court and the ceremonies and festivals that went along with it.

Of course, we’re dependent on our sources here — and these are heavily slanted by the tastes of the Babylonian priestly class. Most of the literate people in Babylon were connected with the priesthoods, and the biggest of those was the priesthood of Marduk…. which was much more likely to be hostile to Nabonidus — and grateful to Cyrus — than any other group. So it’s possible that some Babylonians were less enthusiastic.

On the other hand the [Cyrus Cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Cylinder) refers to the abolition of a forced-labor tax which probably fell most heavily on ordinary folks; if that’s true it may very well be that _everyone_ in Babylon was glad to see the last of Nabonidus.



You can get a flavor of the general situation — albeit, remembering that this is basically pro-Persian propaganda — from a Persian-era Babylonian tablet known as the [Verse Account of Nabonidus](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/anet/verse-account-of-nabonidus/):

> [i.1] [As to Nabonidus:] law and order are not promulgated by him, he made perish the common people through want, the nobles he killed in war, for the trader he blocked the road.

> [i.2] For the farmer he made rare the [unintelligible], there is no [lacuna], the harvester does not sing the alalu-song any more, he does not fence in any more the arable territory. [lacuna]

> [i.3] He took away their property, scattered their possessions, the [lacuna] he ruined completely, their corpses remaining on a dark place, decaying.

> [i.4] Their faces became hostile, they do not parade along the wide street, you do not see happiness anymore, [lacuna] is unpleasant, they decided.

> [i.5] As to Nabonidus, his protective deity became hostile to him. And he, the former favorite of the gods is now seized by misfortunes. Against the will of the gods he performed an unholy action, he thought out something worthless:

> [i.6] he had made the image of a deity which nobody had ever seen in this country, he introduced it into the temple, he placed it on a pedestal; he called it by the name of Moon. It is adorned with a necklace of lapis lazuli, crowned with a tiara,

> [i.7] its appearance is that of the eclipsed moon, the gesture of its hand is like that of the god Lugal-[unintelligible], its head of hair reaches to the pedestal, and in front of it are placed the Storm Dragon and the Wild Bull.

> [i.8] When he worshipped it, its appearance became like that of a demon crowned with a tiara, his face turned hostile [lacuna].

> [ii.1] His form not even Eamummu could have formed, not even the learned Adapa knows his name.

> [ii.2] Nabonidus said: "I shall build a temple for him, I shall construct his holy seat, I shall form its first brick for him, I shall establish firmly its foundation, I shall make a replica even of the temple Ekur. I shall call its name Ehulhul for all days to come.

> [ii.3] When I will have fully executed what I have planned, I shall lead him by the hand and establish him on his seat. Yet till I have achieved this, till I have obtained what is my desire, I shall omit all festivals, I shall order even the New Year's festival to cease!

The New Year’s Festival was the highlight of the Babylonian year — this is tantamount to Nabonidus the Grinch stealing Christmas.
