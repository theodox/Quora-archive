Generally I’d say Python is a better language for any first-time programmer.

C++ is kind of a beastly language just as a language: it’s very syntax heavy and has a lot of hidden gotchas. The syntax issues and the unpredictability (and the lack of a consistent, community-wide approach to handling errors) will make the business of learning about logic, algorithms, and interfacing with system resources more frustrating and be a distraction from getting used to programming.

Java is more predictable and less prone to sabotaging you than C++, but it’s also very wordy. It’s very hard to be an effective Java coder without also learning how to use a Java IDE — which again adds a layer of distraction from the basics of learning how to program.

Python is by far the most readable and least fiddly of the three languages. Either of the other two would make great _second_  languages, particularly once you’ve done enough Python to appreciate some of the advantages (in speed and forced type-safety) that they give you.

To give you the flavor, here are the simplest possible programs in all three:

__Java__ 

    public class HelloWorld {
    
     public static void main(String[] args) {
     System.out.println("Hello, World");
     }
    
    }

__C++__ 

    #include "std_lib_facilities.h"
    
    int main()
    {
    	cout << "Hello World!\n";
    	return 0;
    }

__Python__ 

    print (“Hello World”)
