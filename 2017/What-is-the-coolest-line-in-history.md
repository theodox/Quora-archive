In 387 BC the Gauls sacked Rome. Most of the city’s people fled to neighboring towns, though a handful of diehards holed up in a makeshift citadel on the Capitol hill. While the Gauls were trying to starve them out, a disgraced former Roman general named [Camillus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Furius_Camillus), living in exile, organized the scattered remnants of the Roman army into a guerilla resistance.

Back in Rome the holdouts were running out of food. At length they agreed to buy the Gauls off with the city’s store of gold, which they still had on the Capitol. They negotiated a price with [Brennus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brennus_(4th_century_BC)), the king of the Gauls. As they counted out the ransom, however, they found that the Gauls were openly cheating as they weighed out the gold. When the Romans asked Brennus what was the meaning of this trickery, Brennus unsheathed his sword and threw it into the scales. “What else could it mean_,”_ he said, “but _‘woe to the conquered’_ ”.

While the senators and the Gauls were arguing, Camillus quietly led the Roman guerilla army into the city. While the Romans were arguing whether to submit to the Gauls’ demands Camillus strode into the forum and coolly informed Brennus _non auro, sed ferro, recuperanda est patria:_ The country is to be ransomed with iron, not with gold.

Things went… poorly… for the Gauls after that.



Historians will note there’s good reason for doubting the details of the story (there is at least one Greek source which implies that the Gauls got away with their loot, unscathed). [But it’s certainly a good story](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/camillus*.html). And the Romans, after all, kept their record for the next 800 years.
