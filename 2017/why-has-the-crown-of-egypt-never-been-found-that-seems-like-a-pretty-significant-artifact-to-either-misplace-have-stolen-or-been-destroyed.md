# Why has the crown of Egypt never been found? That seems like a pretty significant artifact to either misplace, have stolen, or been destroyed?

We’re unusually lucky in that we know what the traditional crown — or more precisely _crowns_ , since there were several types — looked like.

But as far as we know there was never a single, special object which was passed down the generations, as opposed to similar ones that were made and replaced as different rulers liked.

More importantly, it’s extremely unlikely that something that’s both very valuable and very portable would survive to our day. There’s about as much time between the dawn of Egyptian history and the end of the Pharoahs (342 BC) as there is from then until today. During that period there were [thirty different dynasties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_Egyptian_dynasties), which means that power changed hands between different rival powers thirty times, often due to civil wars. There was [religious upheaval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarna_Period). There were also three of what Egyptologists call “Intermediate periods” — a polite way of saying “societal collapse.” The kingdom fragmented into warring regions, was subject to banditry, and conquered by its neighbors. The worst of these, the [Second Intermediate Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intermediate_Period_of_Egypt) lasted _a hundred years._ 

After all that, Egypt was under the rule of Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs and Turks for most of the next two thousand years.

That’s why the main symbols of continuity in Egypt are things like the pyramids, the temples, and the sphinx. They are too big to steal.

Against that backgound, it’s pretty remarkable we know as much as we do. It’s thanks mostly to the Egyptian habit of burying treasures as grave goods. But even without invasions, rebellions and foreign conquest, [Egypt has always been plagued by tomb robbers too](https://www.quora.com/Did-Ancient-Egyptians-ever-acknowledge-the-fact-that-the-treasures-they-buried-with-their-dead-would-always-end-up-stolen-within-months-after-the-funeral-and-that-the-famous-curses-deterred-nobody). The main reason that [King Tut is such an amazing presence](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-King-Tut-a-big-deal) is that his is one of _only two*_ certifiable royal tombs from 3000 years of Egyptian history that were found more or less intact…

…it was only robbed twice.

So… no surprise that we don’t have the crown of the Two Lands.
