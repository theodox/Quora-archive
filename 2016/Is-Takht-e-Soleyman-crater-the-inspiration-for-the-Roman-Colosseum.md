Highly unlikely. There are plenty of other oval amphitheatres in the Roman world: this one from Cumae in southern Italy, for example, pre-dates the Colosseum by about two centuries:

The basic engineering involved goes much farther back: Greek theaters were using semicircular design for centuries before the Romans started building them; the main Roman innovation was, as so often, to make them bigger.
