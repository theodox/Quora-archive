# Why is the etymology for "work" in some Romance languages so negative (Pt. trabalho, Sp. trabajo, Fr. travail, from Latin "tripalium", a torture instrument)? What can that tell us about the culture and social life of Late Latin speakers?

This one feels like a case where etymology is not an exact science.

The internet’s favorite etymological guess is indeed _[trepalium](https://laudatortemporisacti.blogspot.com/2011/09/trepalium.html)_ , which means literally “triple stake.” That word does show up in Latin as a torture device — but not _only_ as a torture device: it can be just a structure made of three stakes. In medieval Latin a _[travallum](http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/TRAVALLUM)_ is a frame for securing an animal (say, for shoeing a horse). In early modern French that became _travail_ ; French settlers in North America saw native Americans using triangular frames to drag loads behind horses and named them _[travois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travois)_ _._ The line from “trepalium” to “torture device” is traceable but not necessarily definitive.

> Travois reminds us of a complicating factor: our_“_ travel” also comes from the same root as _travail_ . Is that because travel is regarded as a burden? Or is it because a wooden frame represents, say, an ox-cart the same way it extends to an Indian horse-sling? The association between travel and discomfort definitely goes back to the Romans: “vex” from _vexo_  and “vehicle” from _veho_ share a root. Renaissance French scholars used _vexo_  to translate _travail._ 

However there’s another less common candidate for the paternity of _trabajo_ and _travail_  in _trabaculum:_ a beam or pole. There have been efforts to see that as, say, the yoke of a cart: perhaps it’s a part-for-whole (“wheels” for “car”) or perhaps it’s a metaphor (the worker is yoked to his employment like the ox is yoked to his cart). Latin _trabs_ covers almost anything wooden or stick-like, from a stick to timber to a house or even a ship; the range of metaphorical readings is thus very broad.

Lastly, there’s a more prosaic candidate in the medieval Latin verb _[bajulare](http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/bajulare)_ __ which has pretty much the same range of meaning as _travail:_ on the one hand it can mean to carry or bear, and on the other it can mean to molest or bother. At first glance it doesn’t look like _travail_  at all — but Late Latin often used the prefixes _tre-_ or _tra- (_ meaning “triple”) as a generic amplifier. —the way we might say “double quick” to mean “faster”). In this view an unattested but plausible _trabajulare_  is “to bear a heavy burden.” _Bajulare_  and its derivatives are widespread and not uniformly negative: a _bajulus_ could be a pall-bearer or a sedan-chair man but also a tutor, a manager, or a guild master. It survives in English as the root of _bailiff._ 

So — there are plenty of options to choose from but it’s probably not wise to draw too strong a conclusion. Personally I lean toward _trabajulare,_ since _bajulare_ and it’s derivatives are much more common than trepalium (Latin has a rich vocabulary for excruciations — Q.E.D — so it’d be weird if a fairly obscure one became the word for work in so many languages.) The more prosaic derivation from a wooden frame, however, also might make sense — it’s easy to see this signature medieval work device as a _travallum_ :

To some degree, you can take your pick.

For what it’s worth, there’s one undisputed classic etymology that elegantly captures classical Roman attitudes about work. We are all familiar with __negotiation__ as something business people do. It comes straight from Latin __[negotium](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=negotium&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059)__ __:__ business, employment, or sometimes “hassle”. But _negotium_  itself has a very simple etymology: it is _neg-otium,_ that is, it’s not __[otium](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dotium)__ , — “not leisure”.



Oh yeah — there’s one other, more dubious candidate. Du Cange — the dictionary of Medieval Latin — notes this at the end of the entry for _trepalium_ :

> In Gloss. Lat. Gall. _Trepallus_ , _πρίαπος_  bis legitur. Est autem _Priapus_  machina bellica ; sed apud Scriptores longe recentioris ævi ; verum _Trepallus_ , pro _Triphallus_ , hic legi observat Salmasius.

TLDR: Sometimes older writers confused _trepallus_ with _triphallus_  which means kinda what you think it means… though its also a _machina bellica_ , ie, a siege engine.

So, if you want to speculate more on late antique attitudes to work you can meditate on __that.__  But I don’t recommend google image search.
