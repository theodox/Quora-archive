Good places to look are many -- no list can do more than scratch the surface. Even though the internet can drive you nuts, it really is a wonderful time to be a bibliophile or an antiquarian.

__Primary Sources__ 

For sheer scope -- and if you're interested in the look and feel of the material and not in digitally searching texts -- the [Vatican Library ](https://www.vatlib.it/home.php)is astonishing. Only a fraction of the material is digital right now but it's growing; they have both [manuscripts](http://www.mss.vatlib.it/guii/scan/link.jsp) and [incunabula](https://www.vatlib.it/home.php?pag=inc_digitalizzati) of amazing, rare books. Unfortunately they use a very archaic cataloguing system (mostly in heavily abbreviated Renaissance Latin) so you will probably only find stuff here via a scholarly reference from elsewhere. Still just amazing to browse, however.

For more user-friendly sources:

[Perseus Digital Library](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/) I'm partial to this one - 23 years ago I did a [HyperCard ](http://hypercard.org/)stack as a front end for it, complete with a little dithered bitmap of a library you had to navigate like an adventure game. But don't let that dissuade you. It also includes links to the most commonly used Latin and Greek dictionaries as well as other scholarly resources.

[LacusCurtius โข A Gateway to Ancient Rome ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/home.html)is a great resource for the Roman world (but it includes plenty of Greek sources too). Less slick but more approachable than Perseus

[The digital Loeb Classical Library](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/loeb/digital.html) In the physical world, Loeb's is the standard source for parallel translations of ... everything Classical. It's available online in scanned form.

[The Internet Classics Archive](http://classics.mit.edu/) from MIT is pretty good, though somewhat 1990's production values. It has a good facility for downloading whole works, but the searching seems to be busted these days.

[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae](http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/) aims at being the most comprehensive source for Greek material. Unfortunately much of it is paywalled -- but its got a lot of good free resources too.

[Monumenta Germaniae Historiae](http://www.dmgh.de/) is a huge collection of medieval -- often overlapping with late-Roman -- documents relating to "Germania" -- which, in the expansionist definition of it's original 19th century creators includes northern Italy, eastern France, Scandinavia, Austria, central Europe and the northern Balkans.

[Inscriptiones latinae selectae ](https://archive.org/details/inscriptioneslat01dessuoft)and [Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum : T](http://cil.bbaw.de/cil_en/index_en.html)he largest professionally collected sets of Latin inscriptions (Scanned book)

[PHI Greek Inscriptions](http://epigraphy.packhum.org/allregions) collects online access to many collections of Greek inscriptions.

[POxy Oxyrhynchus Online](http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/) has the digital part of the Oxyrhynchus papyri: the Ptolemaic Egyptian garbage dump that is our single most vivid look at ordinary life in antiquity.

The [Acta Sanctorum ](http://acta.chadwyck.co.uk/)is the semi-official collection of documents related to the lives of Catholic saints. It's a great resource for Late-Roman and early medieval chronicles and biographies (paywalled database).

The [Patrologia Latina ](http://pld.chadwyck.com/) the canonical collection of early Church literature in Latin from about 200 to 1200 (paywalled database)

[Biblioteca Virtuale On-Line](http://bivio.filosofia.sns.it/) (in English and Italian) is a good database of primary sources for medieval and Renaissance Italy.

[Medieval Manuscripts on the Web](http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/sechard/512digms.htm) is a good pointer to digitized/facsimiles of medieval manuscripts

[Suda On Line (SOL)](http://www.stoa.org/sol/help.shtml) hosts a searchable version of the Suda, the great Byzantine Greek encyclopedia.

the [Corpus Christianorum ](http://www.corpuschristianorum.org/ccbk/ccbk.html)

Is a collection of Church writing from the first to the 13th century in Latin, Greek, Coptic, Syriac and Armenian. It's searchable but not digitized: you have to order microfiche or microfilm copies of most of the rare stuff. There are several sub-series, from the CCSL ("series Latina") to the CCCM ("continuatio medievalis")



__Secondary sources__ 

The [Oxford Classical Dictionary](http://classics.oxfordre.com/) and the [The Cambridge Dictionary of Classical Civilization](http://www.cambridge.org/US/academic/subjects/classical-studies/classical-studies-general/cambridge-dictionary-classical-civilization) are the standard reference works in English. The excellent German alternative is known as the Pauly-Wissowa, and is also available in English as the [New Pauly Online](http://www.brill.com/publications/online-resources/new-pauly-online) 

[The Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World](http://orbis.stanford.edu/) at Stanford is a great way to look at ancient travel and economics without the 'airplane view' bias of modern maps.

[Main ยง Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilization](http://medievalmap.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do) is an impressive GIS database of ancient sites and citations.

[Regnum Francorum Online](http://www.francia.ahlfeldt.se/index.php) is a similar product for the Frankish Kindgom.

[History of Medieval and Renaissance Europe: Primary Documents](http://eudocs.lib.byu.edu/index.php/History_of_Medieval_and_Renaissance_Europe:_Primary_Documents) is a great pointer to digital collections on European history.

[Arkyves](http://arkyves.org/) is an image search engine focused on European history. Most of the hits will be early modern or later, however (paywalled)

[Classics: Greek & RomanHistory](http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/research/subjectguides/classics/greek&romanhistory.htm) at the University of Colorado has good links to other sites, including more searchable databases of epipgraphy
