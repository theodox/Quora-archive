Almost every Italian noble family in the Renaissance _claimed_  ancestry going back to the early days of the empire — but pretty much without exception there’s more than a thousand years of hand-waving in those family trees.

To pick an example at random, the [Balbi family](http://www.balbifamily.com/index.htm) in modern Italy claims descent from a number of ancient Romans with the name “Balbus”. That’s pretty dubious, however, since “Balbus” in a [cognomen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognomen), essentially an inheritable nickname rather than a family name. Despite appearances [Marcus Atius Balbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Atius) and [Lucius Cornelius Balbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Balbus_(consul)) (to pick a couple of famous Balbi from the Balbi family webpage) are not related, any more than mobsters Joseph “Scarface” DiGiovanni and Joe “Scarface” Bommarito are related.

it would be a Herculean task to get a clear genealogical trail back through the 70–80 generations you’d need to get back to the Roman empire. If nothing else, the record-keeping alone is basically impossible: during the past 2,000 years naming standards have changed considerably. There’s no easy way to create a paper trail — assuming you can even find the paper, which is far from a given if you’re looking earlier than about the middle of the 1400’s.

The familiar ancient Roman names, like “Gaius Julius Caesar” disappeared by the seventh century and but that style of naming was in serious decline well before the fall of the empire. Names became more complex (some aristocrats sported an formal name with a dozen or more parts) but also more fluid as social climbers replaced their paternal family names with more prestigious ones. By the end of the empire it was not a given that the “family” name of a given individual actually reflected biological descent at all: for example the sons of the philosopher [Anicius Manlius Severinus Boëthius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boethius) (477–524) were [Flavius Symmachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmachus_(consul_522)) and [Flavius Boethius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boethius_(consul_522)) — and if you’d asked a contemporary Roman about the philosopher’s family they’d have told you he was one of the [Anicii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anicia_(gens)), _not_ that he was a Boethius.

With the barbarian conquests, many of the upper classes stopped using family names at all, since the Lombards, Goths, and so on followed the Germanic style “so-and-so, son of so-and-so”. Accounts from the Lombard (568–774) and Carolingian (800–888) periods often give only a single name with no qualifier at all.

In the Middle Ages names, had a similar form to those found in other European countries at the same time: when the qualifier is not a patronymic, it’s a place name (“Vincenzo de Caburetto”, ie, Vincent from Caburetto) or an occupational name ( “Andrea Molinaro”, ie Andrew Miller). Even as late as the 1420’s [fewer than 10% of individuals used a stable family name rather than a patronymic, a place name or an occupation](https://www.s-gabriel.org/names/juliana/condado/).

All of that renders the thousand years between the fall of Rome and the early modern period a tracklesss wilderness for would be genealogists. Local records vary wildly in availability and quality before the 18th century but even in the best recorded places, such as Florence, it’s extremely difficult to trace a family back to the year 1000, much less to the 100’s. Very serious aristocratic families, who have successfully maintained private records of their own for 30 generations or more, still tend to disappear about a thousand years back when any hilltop bandit could call himself a “count” if he had the luck to hang on to power for a couple of decades.

Perhaps the shortest gap between reliable evidence and “Roman” origins belongs to the [Contarini](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Contarini.html) of Venice, who first appear in the written historical record in 843 but who claim that their name goes back to one Marcus Aurelius Cottarenus in 425 — a gap of only four centuries, if true. However that’s a big “if”: the form of the name is reason to be suspicious, since by the 420’s old Roman first names like _Marcus_  had fallen out of favor and _Aurelius_  as an imperial name was quite uncommon (a social climber in the late fourth or early fifth century would probably use _Flavius_  instead, like [Flavius Stilicho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho) or [Flavius Aetius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavius_Aetius)). “Cottarenus” is supposed to join the old imperial-era cognomen _Cotta_  with the place-name of the river [Reno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_(river)), but that’s a way of forming a new cognomen with no obvious analogies elsewhere at a time when cognomens were rapidly falling out of use. It sounds a lot more like a bit of Renaissance-era fantasy than a verifiable lineage to me.

_If the Contarini really are correct about their ancestors, 19th century nobleman and politician_ _[Luigi Contarini](http://notes9.senato.it/web/senregno.nsf/1574bd814f1ff77dc12571140059a42d/8d4075ca4a1b4ba34125646f005a630f?OpenDocument)_ _could trace his ancestry all the way back to Rome. I’m skeptical — but it would be cool._
