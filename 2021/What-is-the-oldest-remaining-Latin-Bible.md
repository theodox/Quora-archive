For bits and pieces, you can get back to late fourth or early fifth century. There are three manuscripts which date to the vicinity of 400 based on handwriting styles and textual variants.

The [Codex Vercellensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Vercellensis) from the library of Vercelli may have been done for bishop [Eusebius of Vercelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusebius_of_Vercelli) who died in 371, so it’s often given the title of oldest surviving Latin bible manuscript — nowadays we are less certain of that claim, so the codex might be a generation or two later. It’s sometimes dated as early as 350, or as late as around 400.

The [Codex Bobiensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Bobiensis) contains parts of Mark and Matthew and dates to right around the turn of the fifth century. Some of its unusual readings are included in the homilies of St. Cyprian, and the codex is itself originated in Africa, so it’s representative of Latin translations from a century or so earlier.

The [Codex Bezae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Bezae) is bilingual in Latin and Greek , and contains most of the Gospels and Acts.

All of these differ slightly from what you might get if you google “Latin Bible” — they are all part of the _Vetus Latina_ or “old Latin” tradition. There’s a good list of other known ms. in that tradition [here](http://www.vetuslatina.org/manuscripts). The more famous translation, known as the Vulgate, dates from the same era (it was completed in 405). The oldest piece of a Vulgate manuscript is the [Codex Sangallensis 1395](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=3957), which dates to 425.

_Complete_ copies of either Latin translation tend to be much later — generally late seventh or early eighth century.
