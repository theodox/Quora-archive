The sad thing is, there’s actually a great business to be had in maintaining antique software… up to a point. As the ecosystem withers and support becomes harder and harder to find, the legacy coder can actually command a comfortable premium for the few desperate customers who — probably against their will — are tied to the aging system. Making buggy whips in 1925 is not a great business; making buggy whips in 1952 might actually be a cozy niche business.

…for a while…

And there’s the rub: I recently happened to find out that a friend’s company is going down after a 15 year (!) run in supporting [Lotus Notes](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibmnotes). As long as people are trapped in the past it can be quite lucrative to service their needs — but eventually they will have to move on and that nice little legacy trade will go the way of the dodo.

You want to have two important facts at hand:

How long can this business really last? Are you working for an institution that won’t turn over its systems until they physically fall apart — or one that will switch over as soon as the current CTO retires? Is this a stodgy government agency that can’t change without permission from the legislature, or a business that could get bought out and updated any time? You can’t plan if you don’t have a decent guess about how long this could go on.

What can you (you the individual, or you the team) do to stay relevant when the business does, inevitably, roll over. If things are in comfortable maintenance mode, you should be working hard on learning modern skills or devising a modern replacement for the legacy system you’re nursing. If work is mostly making sure things haven’t broken down, you may be able to get support for an in-house upgrade project, or porting parts of the system to more modern infrastructure. If things are mellow, maybe you can get permission to contribute to relevant open-source projects and upgrade your personal skill set and reputation.

Either way, the key thing is not to get comfortable. A legacy maintenance business has a limited lifespan, you want to be ready well before it dies. If work is not a place where you can polish modern skills, you can certainly do Open Source community work on your own time.

Or, you can force the issue by saying “hey — this job is damaging my long term career prospects. If you want me to stick around you have to compensate me for that risk” and just take the extra money. That’s not a threat to make unless you’re prepared to walk — but it may be worth it just to keep yourself from getting trapped.

Above all: make the decision for yourself. Don’t sit around and wait for something nice to happen. The next Big Event in the life of a 20 year old application is probably an extinction event.
