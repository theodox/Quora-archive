About the only thing majors will add to your educational experience is access to a few high-level classes or seminars late in your college career. Many times you can talk your way into these if you've been an active, enthusiastic student in lower-level courses. If you really have the drive to pursue multiple interests fully, the extra verbiage on your transcript won't matter; if you don't, a multiple major risks spreading yourself too thin. 

Majoring is a "public" thing -- what you actually learn and study is purely your own choice. Pick a _major_ based on your best guess about what you'll be doing after college; pick your _courses_ based on your interests.
