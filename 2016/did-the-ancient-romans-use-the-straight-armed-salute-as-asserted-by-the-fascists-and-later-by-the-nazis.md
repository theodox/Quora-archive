We don't really know - it's not directly attested. We're not even sure what convinced the modern adopters to regard it as 'Roman'. The ultimate source is likely to be Roman coins depiction whats known as an _adlocutio:_ an emperor addressing his troops:

Unlike a modern military salute, however, this was (probably - again, we're not 100% sure) a part of political rhetoric. Certainly ancient orators trained their students in the use of gestures to hold and direct the audience's attention. You'll notice that in all the images its the general who has his arm raised, not the subordinates -- the soldiers aren't depicted returning the gesture in the fashion of most modern militaries.

The gesture was popularized in modern times by the 1913 Italian movie _Cabiria_
