Good answers so far, and as you can see the general consensus is fairly positive. 

Just to play devil's advocate, I'll say __no__ . Splitting the empire territorially was solving the wrong part of a much more complicated problem.

The split was not obviously stupid: as many other answers point out, splitting the Empire made for faster communications and somewhat more responsive government, and it provided each half with at least one border that didn't need to be watched. To some degree it also offered some degree of containment, so that the eventual collapse of the west did not drag the Byzantine half of the empire down.

However, I think that the real driver behind the split wasn't military strategy or communications: it was the inability of the Roman state to keep its military obedient to a civilian government. To be fair, this was an old, old problem, dating back at least to the days of [Marius and Sulla](http://www.forumromanum.org/history/morey20.html), however it was the central weakness of the Empire. The [third century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century) was consumed in an endless series of military usurpations, coups and counter-coup. Although Diocletian gets the credit, the empire was really saved by [Aurelian](http://Aurelian), who herded all of the sundered parts of the empire into a single whole again as well as defeating the Goths, Vandals, Sarmartians, Alamanni and other barbarian neighbors. Typical of the time, though, Aurelian was murdered by his own praetorians after only 5 years on the throne. In the decade between Aurelian's death and Diocletian's ascension, there were several more military rebellions: of the 6 emperors between Aurelian and Diocletian, only one died of natural causes (and one died of supernatural causes: [Carus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carus) was struck by lightning). 
 
Diocletian was smart enough to realize the endemic weakness of the system, and he tried to tame the perennial competition by using the top military leaders as counterweights to each other. By providing built-in backups -- designated successors -- the system was supposed to make sure that no rogue colonel could hope to reach the throne with a single revolt. By making sure that the two _Augusti_  and their respective _Caesares_ shared the legitimacy of the whole, any one of the four who tried to eliminate the others would start at a terrible disadvantage.

Co-emperors was not a new idea - that goes back as at least as far as Antonines who invented it as a way of insuring against succession struggles. Splitting the commands geographically, on the other hand, was more novel: you can clearly see that Diocletian's vision was tactical by noting where he placed the capitals of his new system: in the legionary camps of Trier and Milan in the west, Sirmium and Nicomedia in the east. These are clearly military centers, not administrative or trade hubs. 

While this is definitely an efficient concentration of military resources, it accelerated rather than stopping the divorce between the military and civil sides of Roman life. The physical isolation of the emperors with their armies cemented, rather than stopping, the connection between political power and military ambition. The interior of the empire was increasingly seen as a source of supply for the army, rather than the army being seen as the protector of the empire. 

Diocletian's related reforms -- huge tax hikes, heavy-handed efforts to control the economy, and aggressive bureaucratic centralization - all made this worse: the split of the empire was part of a pattern in which all other needs were subordinated to frontier defense, which set the economy and civil society in general into a long-term decline which eventually ended in feudalization. One key reason why the empire was "too large" to govern for Diocletian is that Diocletian wanted to rule in a way no previous emperor had attempted, asserting detailed bureaucratic control over huge swathes of the civilian world.

The split was part of this package: indeed, it was partly driven by Diocletian's desire to impose a more uniform order on the empire since the highly regimented system he envisioned would suffer from communications delays in ways that the older, looser imperial system did not. 

Unfortunately it suffered from two critical flaws. 

The first, and most obvious, was that it __didn't really prevent further internal strife__ : Before Diocletian died, the tetrarchy had already had another civil war (in 307: the [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrarchy) needs graphics just to show how complex the system had become, a good example of how chaotic things were even in this "calm" period). Wars between east and west happened several times between 313 and the nominal end of the west in 476. The Gothic invasion of Italy in and the sack of Rome in 410 were enmeshed in East-West politics (see [What were the sackings of Rome in the year 400 by the Goths and Vandals like? ](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging) ) and military cooperation between the two halves was notably lacking at this critical time. So, as a purely military matter the split was a wash: it made for more effective frontier defense only when both halves of the empire were focused on strategic cooperation.

The second more subtle problem is that it __accelerated the disintegration of the old, Mediterranean Roman world into two disjointed halves__ . Internal trade, the transmission of ideas and culture, and the movement of people all started to break down as the empire formalized the split between its Latin and Greek halves. The older empire had prospered as a diverse federation of many local orders, including tribes, kingdoms, and city-states. The two halves of the post-Diocletian world tried to systematize that diversity. This had bad outflows both in the form of religious persecutions (both pagan and Christian) and also in economic decline as the imperial command economy gradually killed off the older system. The drive for uniformity within East and West made them increasingly self-similar, purging the pagans, Arians, Gnostics and so on -- but also less like each other. By the time Justinian tried to reconquer Italy for the "Romans" in the 6th century, many Italians preferred their barbarian overlords to their Greek-speaking "liberators". 

Which is, after a long windup, the point of my one-word answer: Legally, splitting the empire didn't create two separate entities; but it did begin a dynamic in which the old, diverse Roman world was divided into two much more homogenous, but mutually suspicious cultures that could not cooperate effectively.
