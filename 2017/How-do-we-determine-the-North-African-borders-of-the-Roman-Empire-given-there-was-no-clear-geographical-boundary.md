At least in part there are archaeological remains. The [Fossatum Africae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossatum_Africae) represents only one of the many different, shifting frontiers which the Romans occupied at different times but it gives good clues. We have also found [Garama ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germa), the capital of the Garamantes who were that largest known population on the other side of the border. Between them we have a reasonable idea of where the border lay in Algeria, Tunisia and parts of eastern Libya.

In some cases the landmarks that the border rested on were well known — the Atlas mountains, for example. However there is definitely guesswork involved; sometimes going by things like “how many days did we march chasing after bandits” or “so many days travel from here to here”, which involve a good deal of unknown variables. So, it is wise to treat those lines in the map as educated guesses rather than firmly established facts when you aren’t close to a known archaeological site.
