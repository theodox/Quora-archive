More or less, but not exactly.

The HRE didn't get its "H" until the reign of [Frederick Barbarossa (1178-1190)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor). The Carolingians were merely "Emperors of the Romans." 

However, Frederick's dynasty regarded itself as the heir of the Carolingian empire, which finally lost all connection to Charlemagne's family in 924 with the death of Berengar of Friuli. There was a generation without emperors until [Otto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) put the pieces back together, whipped the Magyars, and became emperor in 962.

 In practice the institutions and laws which governed imperial elections in the Middle Ages owe more to Otto and the German duchies than to Charlemagne, but the later emperors definitely believed themselves to be Charlemagne's successors.
