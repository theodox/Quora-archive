My guess is no.

The game had really changed since the great days of Spartan power — warfare in the age of Chaeronea, Issus, and Gaugamela was a more complex and sophisticated undertaking than it had been in the era of the Peloponessian war, and the Spartan state was not adept at keeping up with the times.

The Spartans enjoyed an outsized reputation because they were professionals fighting amateurs: most Greek city-state armies were built around half-trained militias, suited only for the most basic tactics. Although the Athenians never tried to tackle the Spartans head on, they evolved a variety of new tactics which highlighted the weakness of the traditional Spartan phalanx — it probably didn’t hurt that many of the fighters who beat the Spartans at [Sphacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sphacteria) and [Lechaeum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lechaeum) were mercenary peltasts: professionals rather than amateurs.

The Macedonians under Philip evolved a very professional army. If nothing else, it took a lot of time and drill to use those 18′ _sarissai_ effectively rather than just getting tangled up into an unwieldy mess. Phalanxes were hardly nimble, but well-drilled phalangists were still far more capable than citizen hoplites. Moreover Philip’s intervention in Thessaly (~ 358 BC) gave him privileged access to Greece’s most renowned horsemen. Thessaly and Macedon were both cavalry powers — their open terrain and semi-feudal social systems produced excellent mounts and born-to-the-saddle riders; united under one banner they were extremely formidable. Together these created the “hammer and anvil” that Alexander would use so effectively in the east — but even in Philip’s day they were very, very formidable.

It also didn’t hurt that Macedonia was vastly larger than individual city-states. In the climactic battle at Chaeronea, Philip only brought _half_  his army to face the combined armies of the Thebans, Athenians, Corinthians, Megareans, Achaeans and Troezenians.

You can see the sophistication of Philip’s army very clearly at [Chaeronea](http://www.livius.org/articles/battle/chaeronea-338-bce/). Philip’s right executed a fighting withdrawal without losing cohesion, drawing the allied left away from the rest of their comrades. On command, however, they were able to reverse facing and countercharge their pursuers. At the same time Alexander and the best of Philip’s cavalry hit the stretched-out allied center, splitting the Greek forces in two. This is a high level of tactical sophistication in a world where Epaminondas’ use of an advance in echelon — only a generation before — was “revolutionary.”

It’s certainly true that the Spartans would have been a welcome addition on the field of Chaeronea — if nothing else, they could have significantly tilted the numbers against the Macedonians, perhaps rendering Philip’s tactical finesse more risky. They had shown the ability to innovate, however grudgingly, during the Peloponessian war and in the crises that followed Leuctra. They also showed themselves not to be too proud to play the game by modern rules — their first victory after Leuctra was known as the “[Tearless Battle](https://books.google.com/books?id=npNUDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA539&lpg=PA539&dq=tearless+battle+arcadians&source=bl&ots=l74GinAzM8&sig=fQIOVN_Uf9uh-4G27cQjEDnNPQE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEu5Hdk7vYAhUY7WMKHXKcAigQ6AEIWDAH#v=onepage&q=tearless%20battle%20arcadians&f=false)” because it cost no Spartan lives…. primarily due to the fact that most of the fighting was done by Celtic and Iberian mercenaries on loan from the tyrant of Syracuse.

In any case, battlefield considerations may not be the most important ones. It’s hard to see a scenario where Leuctra and Mantinea had not happened and yet the Athenians, Thebans and Spartans stood shoulder-to-shoulder against Macedonia. Epaminondas, after all, first became famous in the conspiracy which drove the Spartan occupiers out of Thebes; if the Thebans had not broken the Spartan hegemony and freed themselves in the 370s, it’s almost certain that they would have welcomed Philip with open arms in the 350’s (Philip, incidentally, spent time in Thebes as a youth, and some hypothesize that he learned his trade from Epaminondas himself).

You can imagine a scenario where the Spartans, having retained their commanding position in Greece, also [retained their dubious position as the Great King’s sheepdogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Antalcidas). If their old hoplite virtues were insufficient to hold the Macedonians at bay, Persian gold (and perhaps a Persian move against Thrace) might have hobbled Philip’s ambitions.*

On the whole, though, the idea of an invincible Spartan hoplite army staring down the Macedonians is more romantic than practical. A decade later, while Alexander was chasing Darius across Syria, Spartan king [Agis III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agis_III) tried to raise Greece against the Macedonian garrison troops. Even with Alexander away, a large mercenary contingent, and a good deal of Persian coin in his pockets the best he could accomplish was a noble death on the field of [Megalopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Megalopolis) in 331.



_* A great deal would depend on how cannily Philip played his cards in the north. In our timeline he had alienated the Athenians with his capture of Potidaea, Perinthus and Methone. In a world where Sparta was still dominant Philip might have been willing to concede more to Athenians worries in the north Aegean in order to forestall a grand Spartan-Persian-Athenian alliance against himself._
