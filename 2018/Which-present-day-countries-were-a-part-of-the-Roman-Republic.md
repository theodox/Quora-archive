The Republic had some degree of influence over pretty much every country touching the Mediterranean, the Adriatic, or the Aegean sea.

The exact answer to the question will depend on your time frame and your definition of ‘belonging’. A country like modern Israel, for example, was not a formal province of the Republic (it was annexed to the empire under Augustus in 6 BC) but Roman influence was ever-present in Judean affairs. Likewise the kingdom of Mauretania (modern Morocco) was independent — but the Romans were able to impose their own candidates on the throne when it was important.
