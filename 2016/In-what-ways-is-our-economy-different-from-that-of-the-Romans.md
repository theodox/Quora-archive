Actually it's far easier to answer this question if you flip it on on its head. The differences are so broad that it's far easier to single out the handful of similarities first.

The Roman economy was usually, in modern terms, a mixed-market economy: most economic activity was in the hands of private individuals and partnerships (not of companies: more on that in a bit) but the state retained control over the "commanding heights of the economy" -- the elephantine size of city of Rome, for example, was only possible because the government secured huge grain supplies from Egypt and north Africa through a huge bureaucratic network of state-owned plantations and forced-labor service (interestingly, _not_  slave labor) from the unlucky peasantry. 

If you visited the Roman empire and only traveled through Egypt you might think you'd landed in an antique version of Mao's China, from the personality cult surrounding the emperors to the extensive system of regulations that tied the peasantry to they villages where they were born and forbade them to leave or change jobs. 

On the other hand the big cities -- particularly those of the Mediterranean shores - were bustling commercial hubs with traders and entrepreneurs from all over the vast and diverse Roman world haggling and dealing. We usually know less about these people than we'd like: our sources always reflect the viewpoint of Rome's political elite which was less diverse and which pretended, at least, to be above the grubby realities of trade (it was technically illegal, for example, for members of the Senatorial class to participate in any kind of business partnership: a prohibition which was repeated with great frequency throughout its lifetime, indicating the fact that it was always being ignored - but it still reflects the attitudes of the ruling classes).

In the Republic and early Empire the overall economy was not a single, completely integrated unit: most of the Roman world retained a high degree of local autonomy till around the end of the 3rd century (Egypt -- which had been a plantation economy under Cleopatra and her family, was again the exception). Away from the seas communications were poor and overland transportation was expensive so there were really hundreds of local economies held together by military force and a single customs regime instead of single unified economy. The rise of the Empire -- ending more than a century of civil wars and starting a long period of internal peace -- knit all of these regions together more closely; the first and second centuries were the peak of the _Pax Romana_ and show a lot of features that would remind us of globalization: increased trade, increased wealth, but also increasing concentration of wealth and the rise of highly specialized production regions at the expense of small-scale local manufactures.

Some critical differences between the Roman and modern economies include:

__Slavery__ . In the aggressive period of the late Republic, slavery played a large part in the economy: the flood of slaves created by the wars against Carthage and the Hellenistic kingdoms seriously altered the workings of the economy, particularly in Italy. The relatively prosperous agricultural middle class of the Italian peninsula was seriously undermined by big plantations worked by slaves: the weakness of the traditional smallholders played a big role in the professionalization of the Roman military and led pretty directly to the death of Republican government and the rise of military dictators. 

However slavery declined gradually from that peak as the flood of war captives dried up. The hard line between chattel slaves and the free poor blurred over time. Not only did many slaves end up free (Roman law, unlike that of the American south for example, was fairly lenient on the subject of manumission and many masters found it easier and more economically efficient to turn resentful slaves into grateful _liberti,_ which damped down the incentive problem that usually affects slave societies. By the late second century or so slaves had (theoretically at least) the right to legal protection from cruel and arbitrary treatment, which continued to improve down to the end of the Empire. 

__Peonage.__  While slavery declined slowly in importance over time, something more like the stereotypical medieval system of serfdom gradually became more important. Restrictions on the movement of the rural poor in particular had always been around in unsystematic fashioned, but after the age of [Diocletian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian) the Roman state started taking an active interest in tying peasants to the land (and also obliging working people generally to stick in their hereditary occupations). Over time the lot of these _coloni_ came increasingly to resemble that of serfs: legally 'free' but economically unfree.

__Bureaucratization.__ The [Crisis of the Third Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century) , which included both devastating civil wars and serious plagues, started the slide into serfdom for much of the Roman world. The same crisis kicked off an huge, ill-fated effort to run the entire economy on strict command and control lines., with comprehensive price controls and extensive bureaucratic oversight of the movement of goods. The [Edict on Maximum Prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_on_Maximum_Prices) from 301 is an invaluable document for historians, providing the 'official' price for hundreds of commodities -- however, it worked about as well as similar systems have worked down the ages. The system eroded over time but left in its wake a much more elaborate regulatory structure and significantly bigger government footprint in a variety of industries; most notably it set the stage for the [Byzantine silk monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_silk) which was a key prop of the Byzantine economy.

__Commodity currency.__ Rome didn't have paper money or debt financing: the only tool of monetary policy was the exchange of actual metals. The closest Roman equivalent to a central bank would be the habit of many emperors of debasing the currency: replacing gold and silver with base metals. This tended to produce cycles of inflation and hoarding and accentuated the drift into a decentralised rural economy around self-sufficiency rather than trade.

__Corporate structure.__  Rome never evolved a good analogy for the limited liability corporation. Businesses were commonly family concerns or partnerships, and few of these lasted beyond the lifetimes of their founders. This put pretty strict limits on the size and complexity of private enterprises.

__Intellectual property.__ The Romans had no patent law (that's a Renaissance invention). This meant that trade secrets were ferociously guarded. Most of the 'lost technologies' of the Roman period were not lost due to 'barbarism' or 'ignorance' -- they were lost because the fragile family businesses on which they depended deliberately kept them from being recorded and thus made them impossible to reproduce.
