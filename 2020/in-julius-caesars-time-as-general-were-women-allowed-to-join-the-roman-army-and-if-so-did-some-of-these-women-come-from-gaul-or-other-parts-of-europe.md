# In Julius Caesar's time as general, we're women allowed to join the Roman army? And if so, did some of these women come from Gaul or other parts of Europe?

No.

There have always been a handful of women who managed to find places on pre-gunpowder battlefields for reasons of their own, but with a very few exceptions (like the [Dahomey Mino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahomey_Amazons)) these were very unusual individuals; impressive — but by definition you can’t make an army out of unusual individuals. The occasional warrior queen, like [Boudica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boudica) or [Zenobia of Palmyra](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-Zenobia/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=5b4f5b16&srid=zLvM) was present because of her rank and the loyalties she inspired — not, in general, because of her hand-to-hand skills.

Pre-gunpowder battlefields were driven by muscle power, particularly upper body strength. Even among men there were significant advantages to size: the nominal height requirement for men in the Roman army was 5’10” in Roman feet, around 172 cm. That excluded more than half of Roman men — and it excluded around 99 percent of Roman women (the average height for women was around 155 cm). Even if the Romans had wanted women in the ranks they would have been unable to find ones who met their standards — and that’s not counting the differential in upper body musculature. Women tend to have about half the upper-body muscle power of men, on average so that rare 5′10″ female soldier would still have trouble competing with other recruits.

The other consideration is that very few ancient societies could afford the demographic risk of putting young women in harm’s way: young men of military age are ultimately expendable but women of reproductive age are not if a community wants to survive. The one notable exception in Roman times was the [Cimbrian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimbrian_War), in which the invading Germanic tribes were moving as entire peoples with women and children accompanying the warriors, although the women didn’t fight in the line of battle they did fight from behind the barricades of wagons in the rear areas. The ferocity of the women impressed the Romans greatly. However, it also illustrates the demographic problem: the Roman victories at Aquae Sextiae and Vercellae basically extinguished the invading tribes, who vanish from the historical record.

It is worth noting in this context that ancient women were — like the women who followed the Cimbri — frequently found _around_  battlefields. The Cimbric case was an extreme example but every ancient army traveled with an entire community of women (and often, children) who provided all sorts of services that today would be carried out by uniformed personnel.
