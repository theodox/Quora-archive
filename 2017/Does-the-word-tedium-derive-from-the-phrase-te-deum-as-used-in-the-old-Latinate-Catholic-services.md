No, it’s from [taedium](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=taedium), which means almost the same thing as our “tedium,” although the emphasis on latin is on how “offputting” something is more than on how boring.

_taedia tunc subeunt animos, tunc seque suamque 
Terpsichoren odit facunda et nuda senectus._ 

Thus tedious things weight upon souls, 
and a poor, bare old age hates its own dancing muse

Juvenal 7.35
