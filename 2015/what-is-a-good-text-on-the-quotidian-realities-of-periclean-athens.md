[Amazon.com: Courtesans and Fishcakes: The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens (9780226137438): James N. Davidson: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Courtesans-Fishcakes-Consuming-Passions-Classical/dp/0226137430) is pretty good. There are also a lot of social histories of varying quality.

[Economic and Social History of Ancient Greece: M. M. Austin, P. Vidal-Naquet: 9780520042674: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Economic-Social-History-Ancient-Greece/dp/0520042670/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1428076448&sr=1-8&keywords=vidal+naquet) is a decent academic overview

This one is older and somewhat unfashionably structuralist: [Amazon.com: The Ancient City: A Study on the Religion, Laws, and Institutions of Greece and Rome eBook: Numa Denis Fustel De Coulanges, Arnaldo Mornigliano, S. C. Humphreys: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Ancient-City-Religion-Institutions-Greece-ebook/dp/B004I452I4/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1428076529&sr=1-1-spell&keywords=foustel+de+coulanges) but it has some interesting factoids and a very different perspective from what you'd get in a random selection of contemporary social histories
