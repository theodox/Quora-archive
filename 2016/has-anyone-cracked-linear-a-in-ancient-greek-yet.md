There are some people who think that they're getting a handle on it.

 For example there's this TED talk from a fellow who thinks he can read the [Phaistos_Disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaistos_Disc) using a mix of Linear A and B



And [this page](http://www.ancientscripts.com/lineara.html) claims to see significant Greek language structure using Linear B as a sort of 'analogy'. 

However I'm pretty dubious -- I don't think any of these pass the [Hinks /Opper/ Rawlinson test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform#Decipherment) .
