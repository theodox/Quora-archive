# Are there any ancient events we know about disproportionately to their importance?

The translation function between importance and preservation is definitely not linear (my often quoted example is the career of Trajan — one of the most powerful and popular emperors, who presided of the exact maximum of Roman territorial expansion — and whose achievements are recorded only in spotty, second -hand form for the most part).

Multiple sources for _anything_  are depressingly rare. But we do very frequently have very _detailed_  sources for trivial stuff in far greater detail than, bigger, more interesting things.

Here’s a couple of off-the-cuff examples:

__Tawdry court cases.__ 

Athenian rhetoric and oratory formed the model which all subsequent Greek writers strove to emulate. This meant that a good reputation for prose style in the 4th or 5th century BC gave you a very high chance of being copied down the centuries —- right up to the end of the Byzantine empire, school kids were laboriously copying out the speeches of Demosthenes or Isocrates. Some of these really are historically important: Demosthenes led the Athenian resistence to Macedonian expansion, and it’s really interesting to see how he spun that tense and complicated political scene for his fellow-citizens as they pondered their options. On the other hand a lot of the surviving work of [Lysias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysias), say, is pretty dang obscurantist: a couple of assault charges against rowdy Athenian trust-fund kids, suits about price-gouging in the grain market, hell — a [suit about illegal clearance of olive stumps](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0154%3Aspeech%3D7) round out the catalog in a manner that only the specialist could love.

When you get to the Roman period there’s a similar dynamic, although in this case the list of authors is even narrower. Cicero was the great model of Roman eloquence, so pretty much anything he wrote had a good chance of surviving. A lot of this is great stuff, touching on the burning issues of his day : the _[In Verrem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Verrem)_ _,_ tackling the rampant corruption of the senatorial elite; _[In Catilinam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catiline_Orations)_ _,_ detailing his fight against a revolutionary conspiracy; _[Pro Milone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Milone)_ , which describes some of the political violence that led up to Caesar’s coup; and above all the _[Philippics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippicae)_ _—_ his desperate effort to save the Republic from Marc Antony after Caesar’s death. On the other hand, something like _[Pro Archia Poeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Archia_Poeta)_ gives us a lot of insight into a minor quibble about the citizenship status of the naturalized Greek poet [Archias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Licinius_Archias), or [Pro Cluentio ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Cluentio)which presents a spicy but hardly history-making view of a creepy family drama between unsavory thugs.*

__Puff pieces__ 

In a rhetorically oriented society, people spent a lot of time saying nice things about other people in public. Whether it was praising the performance of an Olympic victor, honoring a respected statesman, thanking a public benefactor or fawning on powerful ruler, ancient orators delivered a lot of formal praise. Imagine a future in which our culture is known only by a collection of Oscar night intro speeches and you get some of the idea.

Since there was a lot of professional interest in how to do all of this fawning and praising in the neatest, most professional way, we have quite a lot of it. Generally more than we have for some of the key pieces of narrative history, which is pretty frustrating.

Sometimes it’s pretty good — [Pindar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindar), for example is one of the greatest Greek poets and he did quite a lot of PR work: his specialty was [victory odes](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0101%3Atext%3Dintro%3Asection%3Dpos%3D6) in honor of successful athletes. Luckily for modern readers he tends to lay on the mythological and religious background pretty thick, so the groveling is kept in the background — but we still get a lot of verbiage about a bunch of athletes who are known today only because Pindar wrote about them.

On the less satisfying end there are reams of formal panegyrics, many of which address fulsome praise to characters we either know little about or achievements which didn’t really remake the world. So for example you get [Eumenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumenius) saying nice things about [Constantius Chlorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantius_Chlorus) and lobbying gently for education funding in late 3rd century Gaul, or a birthday address on the (dubious) virtues of [Maximian.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximian) In the Greek world you get a lot of formal speeches of thanks for, say, the dedication of a new temple or a new trade treaty or somesuch — a lot of the time, when you’re staring at one of those inscribed fragments in a museum and wondering what it’s all about, it is the ancient equivalent of the “we’d like to thank our generous donors” section in a theater playbill, or maybe the text of a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

Some of this stuff is historically interesting — the addressees, of course, were often poweful history-makers. But a lot of it is formulaic, trivial, or both.

__Still…__ 

It’s frustrating to get 5,000 words on public works projects in 4th century Bordeaux, when records for other things are incredibly spotty. On the other hand there’s a lot of valuable history embedded in the trivia: facts about everything from the details of legal procedure to the history of dance emerge from banal court cases or the boring testimonial dinner speeches. Since well over 90% of everything written in antiquity is lost, we’ll generally take whatever we can get.



* In terms of legacy, this case is at least the origin of the phrase ‘throwing shade’ — Cicero boasted about his win in the case _se tenebras offudisse iudicibus in causa Cluenti gloriatus est “He bragged he had thrown thrown shadows at the judges in the case of Cluentius”._
