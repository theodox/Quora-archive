# Was any Egyptian Pharaoh’s name known before the discovery of the meaning of hieroglyphics inscription?

Before that, we had several lists of Pharaoh’s names collected from a variety of sources but mostly stemming from the work of the Egyptian priest [Manetho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho), who wrote several works about Egyptian religion and history in Greek during the time of the Ptolemies. These survive for us mostly because they religious polemics of the later Roman empire created a big interest in comparative chronology (the first time, it’s worth noting, when Greek or Roman scholarship ever got serious about the actual chronology of the older civilizations to the south and east). The modern convention of “dynasties” as an organizing principle mostly goes back to Manetho.

_These are the entries for the years starting in 1325 BC from the_ _[Chronicon of St Jerome](https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_02_part1.htm)_ _, a Latin adaptation of_ _[a book by the same title of Eusebius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicon_(Eusebius))_ _, which got its Egyptian sources ultimately from the Egyptian priest Manetho. You have to wonder what the scribe (probably, an Irishman) who wrote this in Bern in the year 699 thought when he tried to cram_ Aegypti Ra[me]ses An[ni] LXVI, _“of Egypt, Rameses, 66 years” in the last column of this table. From the_ _[ms. Bern Burgerbibliothek 219](https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/bbb/0219)_ _*_ 

[This link](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/1*.html) collects a bunch of Manetho quotes as preserved in later authors, and [this one](https://pharaoh.se/comparing-manetho) provides a table comparing some variants of the list to modern Egyptological sources. If you look through it you’ll note it doesn’t always sound very Egyptian; comparing the modern-usage names to Manetho’s often makes you ask thing likes “how the heck does ‘___Thutmosis___ ____ ’ turn into ‘__Mephramuthosis__ ’?”

There are two reasons for this: first, because Greek writers didn’t always excel at reproducing sounds in other languages — when the Egyptians themselves eventually adapted Greek letters to write their own language, they had to add several more letters. Second, Manetho seems to have been a bit unsystematic when choosing among the many names and titles that pharaohs used in different contexts; five or six is pretty normal, but a particularly vain pharaoh like [Ramesses II](https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Ramesses-II) could rack up dozens.

In the case above Thutmose’s Egyptian “throne name” was _mn-ḫpr-rꜤ,_ roughly “Men kheper Ra”. His given name was _ḏḥwti-msi(w),_ something like “Djehutimes.” Manetho sort of ran these together (perhaps due to a working of a poorly preserved list?) and got “Mephramuthosis.__”__ 

So: yes, there were lists of pharaohs long before Champollion came along. However until we learned to read hieroglyphics once again we were highly dependent on a very slender thread of evidence. Pretty amazing, all things considered, but less than perfect.



* It’s worth pointing out that in the medieval Latin versions of the Chronicon there was usually a note in the line for 1669 BC:

> "At that time, all the kings of the Egyptians were called Pharaohs, not having names of their own, but rather, for the sake of their dignity, kings would use this word, just as among our people, emperors are called Augusti. But each Pharaoh used to have his own name. Thus we set down this which has been read from the books of Manetho, priest of the Egyptians."
