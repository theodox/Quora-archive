Shakespeare generally followed [Plutarch’s “Parallel Lives”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Lives) as his prime ancient history source. He’s said to have used the translation of [Thomas North](http://www.shakespeare-online.com/essays/plutarchshakespeare.html). You can see [that translation in PDF form here](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/plutarch-plutarchs-lives-englished-by-sir-thomas-north-in-ten-volumes), although unfortunately this edition does not use the fun sixteenth century spellings.
