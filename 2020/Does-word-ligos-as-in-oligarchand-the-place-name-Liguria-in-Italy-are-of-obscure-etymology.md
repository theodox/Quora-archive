No, the “Olig-“ in oligarchy comes from the Greek word oligos, which just means “few”

Liguria takes its name from the [Ligures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligures), the Iron Age people of the region. While the origins of the name are not well understood the word is not that close. It is believed that the name might be transmitted to Greek and Latin via Etruscan, because the Latin word liguscus shows the -sc- sound which is often connected with Etruscan words. That does not mean the Ligures were Etruscan, but it suggests the name derived from what the Etruscans chose to call them.
