__Athens__  and __Sparta__  make everybody's lists. 

 In mainland Greece, __Thebes__ , __Argos__  and __Corinth__  all make good candidates. Corinth was the wealthiest city in mainland Greece for much of the ancient period. Thebes and Argos were both important in pre-classical times and both were politically important in their heyday. Argos peaked before the Persian Wars, Thebe's greatest hour was the dismantling of the Spartan empire after the Peloponessian war. All three cities feature prominently in myths, particularly the Oedipus cycle and the tales of the Trojan War, reflecting their prominence in pre-classical times.

If you count the rest of the Greek world, __Alexandria__  -- fabulously wealthy and the home of the famous library, as well as Alexander's tomb and other magnificent sights -- is a clear winner. Likewise __Syracuse__ was wealthy, powerful and cultured. preserving its independence and power when the mainland was under the Macedonian thumb.
