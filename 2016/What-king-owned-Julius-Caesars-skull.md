Caesar was cremated in a huge, unplanned bonfire in the Roman forum. His remains were so thoroughly incinerated— and so mixed with the various treasures that the crowd heaped on his pyre — that nothing recognizable remained. As far as we know what's left of him is still buried under the temple of Divus Iulius in the forum today.
