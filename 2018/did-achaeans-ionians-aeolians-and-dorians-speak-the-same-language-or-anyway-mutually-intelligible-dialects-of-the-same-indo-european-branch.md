# Did Achaeans, Ionians, Aeolians and Dorians speak the same language or anyway mutually intelligible dialects of the same Indo-European branch?

The ancient view was not very systematic— different writers use __γλῶσσα__  (glossa, “a tongue”), __διάλεκτος__  (dialektos, “a conversation” or “a speech”) and often __γένος__  ( genos, “a race” or “a nation” ) more or less interchangeably. They could easily spot an Ionian or a Dorian but you’d really have to depend on context to be sure if they were talking about his ancestry, his accent, or his civic culture when they applied those labels. All of which makes the matter a bit squishy for modern linguists.

That said, however, modern students usually treat the main Greek dialects as just that — dialects or branches of a single Hellenic language grouping. It’s clear that, despite differences in pronunciation and specialized local vocabularies these were for the most part mutually intelligible modes of speech. Even when the Greeks got around to criticizing each other’s dialects (comic poets, for example, were fond of lampooning rival groups for using the “wrong” words) it was in the context of a general idea of a common verbal heritage.

Some casual — but hardly overwhelming —evidence suggests that the linguistic differences were greater for poorer rural populations. This is not surprising as elites, bound by trade and diplomacy, were more closely linked to the wider Hellenic cultural world.
