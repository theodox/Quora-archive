That the style of the illustrious Johnson; so sonorous in verbiage, so opulent in Latinity, so sublimated by a commodious parallelism of expression, and so liberally strewn about with semicolons; should be an object of emulation is, no doubt, an endeavour upon which the learned and the lettered may universally agree.

Inheriting the taste of his Latin auctors for a prose flowing majestically and richly brocaded, his periods seem, to the modern reader, to evoke the dread _run-on sentence,_ enjambed as they often are with many asides and descriptions. Indeed, a critick might justly remark, that the where Strunk and White would descry a paragraph the good Doctor indites but a single sentence.

> I have often thought that there has rarely passed a life of which a judicious and faithful narrative would not be useful__;__  for not only every man has, in the mighty mass of the world, great numbers in the same condition with himself, to whom his mistakes and miscarriages, escapes and expedients, would be of immediate and apparent use; but there is such a uniformity in the state of man, considered apart from adventitious and separable decorations and disguises, that there is scarce any possibility of good or ill but is common to human kind. (Rambler 60)

To adorn a point or add what we might stile a parenthetical expression, the good Doctor will use the comma in preference to the bracket, notwithstanding the appearance of said parenthesis more than two hundred years before Johnson’s _floruit_ . The Johnsonian sentence rolls majestically forward like a mighty river of commas and semicolons, a veritable Thames of eddying ideas and sounds rather than a mere rivulet of sequential statements.

It should be remarked, that a modern reader might find a clause or pendant within his own writing marked off by the emdash, upon which Dr. Johnson would be wont to employ the semicolon: viz, surrounding a list of parallel examples or balanced antitheses. A modern might say

> Dr. Johnson’s writing — marked by Latinate vocabulary and repeated examples of the same point — often uses the semicolon where we might use dashes.

Too, he will oft employ the comma where a living speaker might arrest the hearing of a listener with a glance or a gesture: to impose a halt upon the marching army of his words and, in arresting their progress, allow the reader to review the troops in all their brave array before they enter the mortal field. Rare, indeed, is the Johnsonian declamation where the reader does not encounter a comma within the first breath.

Yet not all his sentences strain the bonds of brevity. He is wont to use a bracing, simple sentence to introduce a new topick or theme, which by its marked contrast to the ordinary music of his prose arrests the reader and compels attention to the new reflection. What the middle-school scholar might name a _topic sentence_ , for Johnson, is often the simplest and yet the most notable of his creations. A short sentence in Johnson demands attention.

He is wont, as well, to embrace brevity in pursuit of aphorism. The most famous Johnsonian dicta are pithy, rivalling the gnomic pronouncements of Delphi or the Seven Sages for compact, oracular expression.

> “If you are idle, be not solitary; if you are solitary, be not idle”

> “Marriage has many pains, but celibacy no pleasures.”

Note too, how his epigrams balance like the the scales of justice, at once to shew his love of order and to emphasize his _punctus_ with repetition. Like Milton, he embraces both the Psalmist’s fondness for dual imagery and the rhetorician’s love of balanced clauses. Thus Johnson will rarely employ a single adjective or qualification when two may be had for the like price.

This love of parallels extends, as by an ordinance of Nature, to lists, catalogues and epitomes of ev’ry kind; for wherever a single example might point a tale, a second will add a nuance, and a third an amplification.

> Through my life it shall be my settled resolution, that I will never depend upon the smile of princes; that I will never stand exposed to the artifices of courts; I will never pant for publick honours, nor disturb my quiet with affairs of state

Haply, the accumulation of incidents enhances the aptitude of his similes; though betimes it can obscure the sense of his sentences, postponing the arrival of the long-awaited verb beyond the endurance of Man.

> __The traveller__ , who tells, in a pompous folio, that he saw the Pantheon at Rome, and the Medicean Venus at Florence; the natural historian, who, describing the productions of a narrow island, recounts all that it has in common with every other part of the world; the collector of antiquities, that accounts every thing a curiosity which the ruins of Herculaneum happen to emit, though an instrument already shown in a thousand repositories, or a cup common to the ancients, the moderns and all mankind; __may be justly censured__  as the persecutors of students, and the thieves of that time which never can be restored.

The custom of English writers, who build their sentences from subject to verb to object, he abhors, borrowing rather the habit of Latinity which defers the placement of the verb and drives the object before, like chained captives preceding great Caesar’s car in a Roman triumph, while the adjective is sometimes obliged carry the train of the noun it serves. He affects the habit of the poets, so oft cited by him, who decree that mere grammar must serve and not constrain the musick of the language.

These lineaments of his style; resembling though they may the garb of the actor upon the stage, which impresses in the darkness of the theatre but is mere shabby stuff in the honest light of day; may serve the would-be Johnson as crutches. The sharpness of perception, the erudition, and the the lightning shift from ponderous pompous generalities to minute observations which characterize the late Doctor, however, are much more laborious of acquisition than any short posting may supply; though the talented impostor may make a pleasing simulacrum, the Deity alone can produce the true and original Johnson.



Whew. That was hard. It kind of misses the point, since 90% of what’s so cool about Dr. J is contained in 10% of what he wrote: the brilliant little zingers that stud those big, long sentences are worth the wait, but hard for us mere mortals to imitate. The music and tone, though, is fairly easy to ape. Though as the he himself said,

> “Almost all absurdity of conduct arises from the imitation of those whom we cannot resemble.”

Some of the best examples of Johnson’s voice are found in his [Lives of the Poets](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/resources/learning/essays/detail/69382), where he can jump from the usual magniloquence to very tight, very technical readings without missing a beat. The [Essays](http://www.johnsonessays.com/). which he wrote for _The Rambler_  and _The Idler_  cover a lot of ground, from sarcastic humor to sometimes treacly moralism, but also sharp observation of human life. I’ve always found [Rasselas](https://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/rasselas.html) less engaging but it’s still a good example of Johnson putting on his best party manners. It’s worth reading some of his poetry too: in his day he was well regarded as a poet and the poetic use of rhythm (along with poetic freedom of syntax and expression) is a big influence on his prose.

Of course a lot of what he’s famous for is what he said in less artificial contexts. For Johnson’s conversational style, you can’t go wrong with reading Boswell — he’s got the knack for catching the best Johnsonisms. The best modern pastiche of Johnson for my money (well, really it’s a pastiche of Boswell, but copies Boswell’s Johnson well) is [Three Cases of Samuel Johnson, Detector](http://amzn.to/2dS7Yqv) by Lillian De La Torre.

Another good thing to consider is Johnson’s Dictionary. A lot of the lovely flavor of his language comes from slightly different uses of familiar words, particularly of the long, Latin-flavored variety. Many of these were new and still catchy in his day and had a more vivid, less conventional use than they do now. The slightly odd application of familiar language is a big part of the effect. Dropping in the occasional bit French or Latin is also a handy trick for sounding erudite.
