It really depends on what you think the practice was for.

If you assume it’s an attempt to completely erase an unpopular regime, then it’s not very effective: there are no significant gaps in the records. Ancient governments lacked the resources for an Orwellian rewriting of history — despite the endless twittering of conspiracy theorists its _hard_  to track down and destroy every reference to someone you don’t like. And for ancient governments with limited resources it’s a luxury purchase.

Case in point: here’s a very public example of a well-known _damnatio memoriae:_

What this shows (quite graphically) is the real impetus behind _damnatio:_  not altering the historical record, but pure __vindictiveness__ . In this case Caracalla had his brother and co-emperor [Geta ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geta_(emperor))murdered. This object was part of a well orchestrated posthumous campaign against Geta’s public images, even this anodyne family portrait which was probably 12 years old when it was defaced. Many coins with his name and legend were re-minted. While there are surviving examples they are suspiciously rare. All over the empire we find his name defaced on inscriptions:

The lack of subtlety here is precisely the point: Caracalla was not airbrushing Geta out of history like an old Bolshevik. Leaving the scars visible was a potent assertion of victory, an in-your-face reminder that Caracalla was in charge and anybody who didn’t like it was in trouble. The aftermath of the murder is said to have claimed 20,000 of Geta’s friends and supporters — Caracalla was not one for subtlety.

Roman _damnatio_ was very effective in one critical way: it was visible and public. A crowd pulling down statues of Domitian, or the clink-clink-clink as a party of legionaries chiselled out the name of a deposed emperor was a very potent form of advertisment. In a world without mass media these displays were as electrifying as the televised toppling of a statue of Lenin or the dynamiting of the Bamiyan Buddhas.

Remarkably we actually have a first-hand look at the process in the form of a Latin inscription discovered in Spain about thirty years ago. It’s a decree of the Senate announcing the official version of the death of [Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnaeus_Calpurnius_Piso_(consul_7_BC)), who was blamed for the death of [Germanicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanicus).

_The_ Senatus Consultum de Cn Pisone Patre,_detailing the posthumous punishments of Piso. Photo:_ _[Hispania Epigraphica](http://eda-bea.es/helper/watermark.php?src=948.jpg)_ 

This document (full text [here](http://eda-bea.es/pub/record_card_2.php?refpage=%2Fpub%2Fsearch_select.php&quicksearch=piso&rec=948), in somewhat gnarly Latin) shows the process at work. It specifies that Piso cannot be mourned, his statues are to be removed, his [funeral mask ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_funerary_practices)could not be displayed, and his name was to be removed from a statue of Germanicus on the forum.

But this is erasure is eminently _public._ The edict survives because it was inscribed on a bronze tablet for public display. We can piece it together because we’ve found fragments of six or seven copies. Piso’s name is mentioned more than 20 times in the inscription.

This is not a memory hole. It’s a detailed piece of public relations, detailing Piso’s alleged crimes, his disloyalty to the empire and the imperial family, even the clemency granted to his children. There were a lot of rumors (visible to us through Tacitus) that Tiberius was not too displeased by the death of the popular Germanicus. This very public repetition of the fact that Piso was “not to be remembered” reflects a great deal of official anxiety that everyone remembers Piso _as the murderer._ The concentration of copies in Spain is no accident either — Piso had been the proconsular governor of Hispania Tarraconensis and will have had clients and supporters among the provincial aristocracy there.

_Damnatio memoriae_  was effective as a public dominance game: it was all about making it clear who was in charge, marking out the winners and losers in moments of intense conflict. What it was not, however, was a means of trying to censor the historical record — indeed, it brought about a kind of infamy which ensured it’s victims would long be talked about, albeit in hushed or scornful tones.
