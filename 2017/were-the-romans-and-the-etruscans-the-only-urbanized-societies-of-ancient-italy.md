No, Italy was pretty urbanized from the 7th century BC onwards. In central Italy you had the about two dozen [Latin cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_League), which were still independent of Rome until the end of the [Latin War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_War) in 338 BC. In east-central Italy the [Umbrians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbri) lived in hilltop cities and the [Picentes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picenum) on the Adriatic coast. The [Samnites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samnites) in the Appenines were less thoroughly urbanized but they had several urban centers. The whole coast of southern Italy, from the bay of Naples around to Tarentum near the “heel” of Italy was dotted with [Greek colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Graecia) from the 8th century onward.

This map gives an idea of the density of urbanism in Italy by the 4th century:
