It’s misleading say the Persian’s didn’t practice slavery or slave trading. There are a lot of internet claims about this but they reflect a mixture of a very real distinction between the Persian economy and those of the Mediterranean world and a [misreading of the Cyrus Cylinder](https://www.quora.com/Did-Cyrus-the-great-abolish-or-ban-slavery/answer/Steve-Theodore) (a misreading which was happily fostered by the Shah of Iran, who wanted to find a “progressive” role model in pre-Islamic Persian history).

On the positive side, we do know that Persian society was more or less “feudal”; a lot of the population were “free” but bound to the land like medieval European serfs. There’s also good bit of evidence — literary and archaeological — that suggests that the Persians (or more precisely _one part of Persia,_ the region of [Persepolis ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis_Administrative_Archives)for which we have some archival material) did not rely on slaves to the same extent as Greeks, Romans, or Mesopotamians did. That much is pretty uncontroversial

Still: there was slavery in the Persian empire. There’s a _lot_ of evidence over several hundred years, across all three incarnations of the Persian empire.

__Achaemenids__ 

In the Achaemenid empire there are a number of accounts of Persians taking slaves. For example, here’s this from Herodotus:

> All this now came upon the Milesians; for the most part of their men were slain by the long-haired Persians, and their women and children were accounted as slaves, and the temple at Didyma with its shrine and place of divination was plundered and burnt.

[6.19](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/6A*.html)

People who want to believe in Persian abolitionism dismiss this (and several other stories involving mass enslavement of captured Greek cities) as “propaganda.” That’s an entirely anachronistic way to to look at it: what kind of propaganda value this would have for a Greek audience who regarded slavery as a normal consequence of warfare? It’s hardly some kind of uniquely Persian vice in their eyes, and it’s passed along without comment time after time.

This isn’t in any way unique, either; similar stories crop up all over Herodotus (again, without being particularly highlighted). When Persian satrap Oroetes murders Polycrates of Samos, he takes his followers as slaves:

> Oroetes then crucified him; as for the Samians in his retinue he let them go, bidding them thank Oroetes for their freedom; those who were not Samians, or were servants of Polycrates' followers, he kept for slaves.

[3.126](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/3e*.html#127)

But when Darius has Oroetes killed, he still keeps Oroetes’ slaves:

> Oroetes' slaves and other possessions were brought to Susa. Not long after this, it happened that Darius, one morning, while hunting, twisted his foot in dismounting from his horse, so violently that the ball of the ankle joint was dislocated from its socket. Darius called in the first physicians of Egypt,α whom he had till now kept near his person; who, by their forcible wrenching of the foot, did but make the hurt worse; and seven days and nights the king could get no sleep for the pain. On the eighth day he was in very evil case; then someone, who had heard in Sardis of the skill of Democedes of Croton, told the king of him. Darius bade Democedes be brought to him without delay. Finding the physician somewhere all unregarded and forgotten among Oroetes' slaves, they brought him into view, dragging his chains and clad in rags.

[3.129](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/3e*.html#127)

In a similar vein Herodotus tells[ the story of Hermotimus of Pedasa,](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D105) a young Carian who was castrated and sold to the Persian king as a eunuch. He eventually rose to a position of power at court and used his position to wreak revenge upon the man who had enslaved him.

But even if you want to read all of _that_  as propaganda there’s really no good explanation for these first-hand observations from Xenophon’s _Anabasis_ 

> Cyrus [the younger] presented him with the customary royal gifts—to wit, a horse with a gold bit, a necklace of gold, a gold bracelet, and a gold scimitar, a Persian dress, and lastly, the exemption of his territory from further pillage, with the privilege of taking back the slaves that had been seized, wherever they might chance to come upon them.

[1.2.27](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&getid=1&query=Xen.%20An.%201.2.23)

and

> In these villages they remained three days, and a deputation from the great king arrived—Tissaphernes and the king's brother-in-law and three other Persians—with a retinue of many slaves.

[2.3.17](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&query=Xen.%20An.%202.3.16&getid=1)

There’s also things like the fact that Babylon’s annual tribute to Persia included 500 castrated boys — a form of taxation which makes no sense at all if those boys were free to turn around and go home whenever they chose.

It is worth pointing out that this doesn’t proves that the Persians practiced slavery on the same _scale_  as their neighbors. But that’s a very different claim than the often repeated but never documented claim that they actually _abolished_  slavery in their domains. We know from innumerable pieces of of evidence — literary and archaeological — that Greeks and Lydians and Babylonians and Phoenicians and many other subject peoples still practiced slavery under the Persian empire without hindrance from the Persian authorities.

Greek sources are the most accessible evidence, but they aren’t the only examples. For example the biblical book of Esther is set in Persia, and Esther is attended both by female slaves and eunuchs. In the biblical book of Nehemiah — [who was governor of Judaea under Artaxerxes I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehemiah) — poor Israelites are reduced to selling their children into slavery.

We have very little documentary evidence from the Achaemenid empire but, we do have things like cuneiform documents from this period include [records of slave sales](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/barda-i) including Persian buyers and sellers, and even slaves with Persian-sounding names. There’s [good evidence for the Persian imperial government collecting taxes on the sale of slaves](https://www.academia.edu/23572293/Registration_and_Taxation_of_Slave_Sales_in_Achaemenid_Babylonia_ZA_79_1989_), so it’s not an example of some kind of surreptitious underground trade.

Above all — surprisingly, given how few private Persian documents actually survive from this period — we even have first-person evidence: [the letters of the Persian nobleman Aršama](https://wayback.archive-it.org/org-467/20190828083642/http:/arshama.bodleian.ox.ac.uk), a satrap of Egypt in the fifth century BC make it pretty obvious:

> From Aršama to Artavanta (‘Artahanta’). I send yo[u] (wishes for) much peace and strength! And now, (there is) peace in this (place) before me. 2. May there also be peace there before y[o]u. And now: there are Cili[cian] men, my slaves, in Egypt: 3. (he) whose name is Pariyama, (he) whose name is Ammuwana, (he) whose name is Saraka, (he) whose [n]ame is TʿNDY, [] (he) whose name is [….]MY, (he) whose name is Sadasbinazi 4. [] (he) whose name is I[nda]ma (?), (he) whose name is Sarmanazi, (he) whose name is Kaʾ, (he) whose name is Bagafarnah, (he) whose name is Piyatarunazi, (he) whose name is Asmaraupa, (he) whose name is Muwasarma, (In) all, 13 men. They were appointed (as) pressers among my domains which are in Upper and Lower (Egypt). After, when Egypt rebelled, and the (armed) force were garrisoned, then that Pariyama and his companions were not able to enter into the fortress. After, the wicked [I]n[ḥ]arou seized them, (and) they were with him. Now, if (it seems) like a good thing to you, let an order be issued by you, so that a person should not do anything bad to that Pariyama and his companions. Let them be released. Let them do my work as previously

[T.AD.6.7](https://wayback.archive-it.org/org-467/20190828084246/http://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/116/2013/10/Volume-2-text-and-translation-interleaved-20.1.14.pdf). You’ll note that both Aršama and Artavanta are Persians.

It’s also worth remembering that slavery doesn’t just mean whip-cracking labor in the fields or the mines. Persian men had both wives and concubines, and the latter were frequently slaves. For example the poor Greek girl [Aspasia](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/aelian/varhist12.xhtml) ended up in the harem of Cyrus the Younger “not willingly nor with the consent of her father, but by compulsion, as it often happens upon the taking of cities.” Now, the story makes a big deal of the way that Cyrus became besotted with her and showered her with gifts — but that is hardly typical of a system where young women are carted off into the embraces of powerful men by force. After Cyrus’ death, she found her way into the good graces of Artaxerxes — by comforting him for the death of his _own_ favorite slave lover, a eunuch boy named Tiridates.

__Parthian Period__ 

There’s also good evidence for slavery in the Parthian period.

The most famous example is the 10,000 or so Roman survivors of the battle of Carrhae who were enslaved and deported to Bactria. But the most picturesque example is the slave girl who became empress of the Parthian realm: [Musa of Parthia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_of_Parthia) was an Italian slave — a gift of the emperor Augustus — who charmed Phraates IV into marrying her… at least, until she had him poisoned and ruled as regent with her young son Phraates V.

_Phraates (left) and Musa (right)_ 

There’s also the Parthian viceroy Himerus, who (according to [Diodorus](http://attalus.org/translate/diodorus34.html))

> enslaved many of the Babylonians, upon slight pretexts, along with their whole families, and sent them into Media to be sold as booty. He also burnt to the ground the market-place, and some of the temples in Babylon; and destroyed the best part of the city.

Himerus was a Hyrcanian, so perhaps his vices reflect the behavior of his rough-and-ready origins — but he’s taking his victims to Media, in the heartland of the empire, not west to Mediterranean markets.

It appears that the Parthians particularly used slaves in their mines:[ Pliny the Younger writes to the emperor Trajan](https://www.bartleby.com/9/4/2026.html) (letter XXVI) about an encounter with a Greek named Callidromos who escaped from a Parthian mine. Interestingly Callidromos was not captured in war, but sent to the Parthian king Pacorus by Decebalus, the king of the Dacians — evidence for an international movement of slaves between the Balkans and Persia, independent of Rome. Pliny enclosed with the letter a small nugget of gold which the escaped slave had smuggled out of the mine.

__Sassanian Period__ 

Slavery is well [attested in Sassanian law](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/barda-ii) — for which, unlike previous eras, we have a reasonable number of Iranian sources. The martial exploits of the Sassanids generated a lot of captives, who ended up as slaves. For example, Shapur I boasted in [his inscription at Naqsh-i-Rustam:](http://parthiansources.com/texts/skz/skz-translation/)

> And the men, who from the land of the Romans, from not-Iran, were led back as spoils, into Iran, into Persis, Parthia, Xuzestan, Asurestan and the other lands, land by land, where settlements were established by me and my father and forebearers and ancestors, there they were settled.

Thus _anšahrīg,_ “foreigner” and _wardāg,_  “captive.” became the common ways to refer to slaves. However Sassanian slavery also encompassed people sold into slavery for debt, or who sold themselves into it voluntarily to obtain economic support.

The terms seem to be generally fairly humane, for a slave law-code — cruelty and mutilation were punishable with fines, for example — but it’s still slave law. It seems to have been illegal to sell an Iranian to a non-Iranian, or a Zoroastrian to a non-Zoroastrian. This is similar to (and may even be the inspiration for) similar prohibitions on the enslavement of co-religionists in Byzantine among Byzantine Christians and early Muslims.

__Islamic Period__ 

In Islamic times slavery became common in Persia.

The Arab Abbassid Caliphate, centered in Baghdad but including much of Persia, was a massive importer of slaves from both Africa and Europe. And the even when the Persians reasserted themselves (under the [Saffarids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffarid_dynasty), in the later 9th century) they clearly still had domestic slaves. There’s a famous story, for example, that [Ferdowsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdowsi), the father of classical Persian literature, was so offended at a skimpy fee given him for one of his poems that he gave the reward to the slave who had brought the money. Later on the [Safavid dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_dynasty#The_Royal_Court) in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries used slave soldiers (similar to the Mamluks in Egypt) taken among Christian Georgians and pagan Circassians.



All this said, it’s still worth pointing out that the Persian practice of slavery does not seem to have reached the same level of ubiquity we find in the Greco-Roman or Mesopotamian world. However there’s a world of difference between that recognition and the claim that that Persians “abolished” slavery. Our knowledge of all of this is more limited than we’d like— we don’t have much native Persian information before the Sassanians — but there’s no reason to think the Persians were so radically different from their neighbors. In addition to all of contemporary evidence already cited it’s important to remember that _no_ ancient source ever says that they _didn’t_  have slaves: something that the many Greek, Roman, and Jewish sources would have found remarkable if it had been true, since it would have been a glaring exception to the behavior of all the neighboring societies.
