During the republic, there was basically no police force or permanent garrison in the city.

_External_ security was routinely handled by the consuls at the head of the army. However even quite late — during the fighting between the the populist mobs of [Clodius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Clodius_Pulcher) and the aristocratic gangs led by[ Milo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Annius_Milo) in the last decade of the Republic — there was no professional force to intervene and restore order within in the city. The Romans were very attached to the ideal of a civilian society governed by respect for law: paramilitary forces or permanent police were regarded as vestiges of monarchy. Even when public order deteriorated badly, the Romans were extremely reluctant to allow armed men into the city.

The murder of [Tiberius Gracchus](https://www.ancient.eu/article/95/the-brothers-gracchi-the-tribunates-of-tiberius--g/) in 133 BC was the first example of open political violence within the city since the foundation of the Republic four centuries before. It’s worth noting in this context that the murders only happened because the Senate had no legal or practical means to forcibly detain Gracchus and his supporters — the reactionary senators who killed him, in fact, personally mobbed him. There was no police force they could send to arrest the troublesome tribune, no paramilitaries who could be relied on to enforce the Senate’s authority.

The weakness of the system was revealed a decade later when Tiberius’ brother, [Gaius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Gracchus) became tribune. Gaius passed several controversial reforms in his first term as tribune, and was re-elected for an unconstitutional second term. However as his political support weakened the senate invented a new (and equally unconstitutional) weapon: the _[senatus consultum ultimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senatus_consultum_ultimum)_ _,_ an emergency decree similar to martial law. The emergency decree effectively suspended the prohibition against military arms in the city: [Lucius Opimius,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Opimius) the consul, used mercenary Cretan archers in his attack on Gracchus and his supporters. The bulk of the fighting, however, was still born by the senators and their supporters themselves.

In the aftermath of Gaius’ death some thousands of his supporters were also killed. However even this large scale violence was essentially privatized. The mechanism was the [proscription](https://www.britannica.com/topic/proscription) — a decrees of outlawry. This provided legal immunity for the killer of a proscribed person, and usually some kind of monetary reward as well.

Over the next century, there were sporadic outbreaks of violence in the city which all followed the same pattern of street violence followed by proscriptions.

Every generation saw a new flareup of violence — the wars of Marius, Sulla and Cinna; the Catilinarian conspiracy; and mob-rule of Clodius; and finally the return of Caesar and the end of the Republic. However even three generations of political violence never created the institutional foundations of a police state.

For a long time the balance between traditional politics and violence was very delicate. [Sulla’s march on Rome](https://www.unrv.com/empire/march-on-rome.php) in 88 broke the taboo on military force in city politics, but the nostalgic ideal remained strong. When Cicero put down the [Catilinarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Catilinarian_conspiracy) using the SCU in 63 — even though the action was popular and the general populace was supportive — his political opponents were able to have him exiled for unconstitutional violence. This was a bit of splendid hypocrisy on the part of his archenemy, the political gangster Clodius, but it also spoke to the deep Roman desire for civilian normality as well.

Unfortunately for the republic the old system did not scale — the web of personal relationships and traditional mores which allowed Rome to muddle through as a self-policing society was not enough to cope with the combination of tremendous population growth, plutocrarization, and the disconnecting of the military from civilian control.

Augustus drew a lesson from all of this. He gave Rome two permanent security forces: the [Cohortes Urbanae](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.ancient.eu/amp/1-15568/) handled routine security duties, particularly crowd control and riot prevention. The [Praetorian Guard](https://www.ancient.eu/Praetorian_Guard/) were the emperor’s personal paramilitaries, providing both security against possible military rivals and secret police service against subversion, real or imagined.
