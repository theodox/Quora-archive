# A former AAA games creative/content director, I'm still looking for a nice creative direction framework or any article to challenge my approach. What would you recommend?

Probably the best thing you can go is just play a lot of games, particularly smaller titles that stray farther from the time worn as formulas. Not everything that comes out of the indie ether is great-- I'll tear out my eyes before I play another pseudo 8 bit retro platformer, thanks! -- but there are some amazing things that happen when you don't need to make 40 million bucks just to keep the doors open. Games like [Never Alone](http://neveralonegame.com/), [Monument Valley](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/), [Papers, Please](http://papersplea.se/) and [This War Of Mine](http://www.11bitstudios.com/games/16/this-war-of-mine) are all great pieces with distinctive styles that are examples of what you can do without AAA blinders on.
