There’s not a good way to know.

It is sometimes asserted that [Cyrus the great banned slavery in his empire](https://www.quora.com/Did-Cyrus-the-great-abolish-or-ban-slavery/answer/Steve-Theodore), but (as you’ll see in the link) that’s a _very_  optimistic reading of one particular text — and we know from other sources that in most of the empire, at least, slavery continued to be a fact of life.

That said, there are some records, particularly the [Persepolis archives](https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/projects/persepolis-fortification-archive), which indicate pretty clearly that a lot of labor which in contemporary countries — particularly Greece — which would have been done by slaves was done by paid free labor in Persia proper. The Persians tended to view themselves as a special elite within the empire and were proud of their distinct culture — which, having originated in the steppes and hills rather than among settled agriculturists and townsmen, does not seem to have been based on the routine use of slave labor familiar in Greece, Rome, Phoenicia or Mesopotamia.

Thus, Persia itself — the home territory of the ethnic Persians — seems to have had fewer slaves than other contemporary regions. We can’t easily assign numbers to that “fewer,” though - our sources are pretty spotty.

We also don’t know whether the Persian empire as a whole had fewer slaves than the rest of the ancient world — or whether the Persians simply delegated the grubby business of owning and managing slaves to subject peoples. An analogy might be the Mongols, under whose rule slavery as an institution flourished even though ethnic Mongols tended not to amass large staffs of slaves after the manner of Roman plutocrats. Since the empire included many places (Asia Minor, the Levant, and Mesopotamia) where slavery flourished it’s quite possible that most Persians simply collected the _profits_ of the slave trade rather than actually owning slaves in large numbers themselves. We do have a handful of pieces of evidence for Persian nobles owned slaves themselves as well: Xenophon, for example, mentions that when satrap Tissaphernes arrived at a parley, he brought a large entourage of slaves ([Anabasis 2.13.17](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&query=Xen.%20An.%202.3.16&getid=1)), and Arshama the Satrap of Egypt — the only Persian whose correspondence has survived — writes [letters concerning his own slaves and those of other Persians](https://wayback.archive-it.org/org-467/20190828084246/http://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/116/2013/10/Volume-2-text-and-translation-interleaved-20.1.14.pdf) (TAD A6.3 and A6.7).

In contemporary Greece (and later Rome) the percentage of the population enslaved varied a lot depending on circumstances: in the aftermath of a long war, when prisoners were plentiful, the number of slaves would be huge. In a few cases it seems like 40–50% of the population was unfree (for example in Italy after the Punic wars and Macedonian wars had produced huge slave surpluses). At other times the percentage was much lower: in Roman Egypt (one of the few places where we have anything like real statistics) only about 10% of the population were slaves. It’s reasonable to assume that the Persian empire experienced similar fluctuations: there were more slaves available when the empire expanded, and fewer when it was stagnant or contracting.
