If you’ve got the money, the [Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World](http://amzn.to/1ZR82ID) is a big and lavish edition which I’d love to have (but haven’t got yet - so I can’t vouch for it first hand).

In the more affordable range, [Peter Levi’s Atlas of the Greek World](http://amzn.to/1ZR7zGl) is pretty good (it’s out of print, alas) . It tends to emphasize art history and archaeology so it’s got some ties to the modern (as of the ‘80’s) state of ancient sites.

The [Landmark Herodotus](http://amzn.to/1Xrjyf6) covers the Greek and to a lesser degree the Persian world — everything Herodotus wrote about — and is pretty well furnished with maps and notes in addition to the text (which is a good edition, as well). I haven’t read the [Landmark Arrian](http://amzn.to/1ZR8GG1), but if it follows the standards for other Landmark editions it will be pretty well furnished with maps and, since it follows Alexander’s route eastward, should provide pretty good coverage of the Persian empire, albeit a couple of centuries after the time you’re interested in.

If you want to ‘roll your own’ [AWMC: À-la-carte Map](http://awmc.unc.edu/awmc/applications/alacarte/) is a bit slow, but nice looking. It seems to use the same sources as the Barrington, for the most part. The site is fairly configurable but it’s a bit pokey to use.

As an aside, the huge disparity in the literary sources generally means the coverage for the Greek world is usually going to be much denser than for the Persian side.
