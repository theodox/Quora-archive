__No. Greece did not exist at the time.__ _[warning: simplified for rhetorical effect]_ 

There _were_ a lot of Greek speaking states, but they didn’t act as one entity. In fact, their inability to get along was the main reason why Persia had been dominating Greek affairs for two centuries before [Alexander the Great ](https://www.ancient.eu/Alexander_the_Great/)came along .

It was Alexander and the [kingdom of Macedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)) that conquered Persia, with a bunch of reluctant and unhappy Greek allies dragged along in tow. There were about as many non-Macedonian Greeks fighting _for_  the Great King in the big battles of the war as fought against him. Moreover while Alexander was fighting the Persians, the Persians were sending money to Sparta, which organized an unsuccessful rising against the Macedonians in mainland Greece. Meanwhile large portions of the Greek world — Epirus, southern Italy, Sicily, the cities on the Black Sea and in Libya —- took no part in the fighting at all.

“Greece” in 332 BC was a cultural, not a political entity — more like, say, “Eastern Europe” or “Latin America” than Russia or France. On the eve of the war, significant slice of the Greek-speaking world was Persian territory and had been for almost three hundred years. Plenty of famous “Greeks” — including most of the early philosophers who laid the foundation for Greek science — were Persian subjects all their lives.

You can see this in a wisecrack of Alexander’s that has become a football in the dreary sniping between modern Greeks and the republic of Macedonia. Alexander wanted to single out the Spartans because they had refused to follow him to Persia, so

> in order that the Greeks might participate the honor of his victory, he sent a portion of the spoils home to them, particularly to the Athenians three hundred bucklers, and upon all the rest he ordered this inscription to be set: "Alexander the son of Philip, and the Greeks, except the Spartaans, won these from the barbarians who inhabit Asia."

Nowadays, one side sees this as proving that Alexander wasn’t a Greek (_see, he said “and the Greeks!”)_ while the other sees this proving that he was a Greek (_see, he said “Alexander and the Greeks”)._ But either way it demonstrates the issue here: “Greece” without Sparta, it’s traditional military leader, and without Thebes, which Alexander [had razed to the ground ](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/diodorus/the-sack-of-thebes/)a couple of years before was hardly “Greece” acting as a nation. It’s worth noting in this connection that within a decade of Alexander’s conquest of Persia, most of the Greek cities would try twice to destroy the kingdom of Macedon so they could go back to their traditional occupation of fighting each other.
