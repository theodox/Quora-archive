The Romans did fight against Spartans— but it was long after the glory days. The Romans won an embarrassingly easy victory over [Nabis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabis), the last Spartan king, in 192BC, but most of the troops they defeated were mercenaries. The Sparta that the Romans defeated was almost a parody of its former self. The true Spartan warrior class had basically died out in the century after the rise of Alexander the Great.

[Agis III ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agis_III)tried, unsuccessfully, to break the Macedonian hold on Greece, but he died on the field of [Megalopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Megalopolis) in 331 BC: the Spartans were so completely beaten in that battle that it was widely expected that Alexander would order the city destroyed, as he had already done to Thebes. But — always a sentimentalist when not in danger — he allowed Sparta to live on in honor of its former glories. However the Sparta of legend died in the mud of Megalopolis with Agis:

> He had fought gloriously and fell with many frontal wounds. As he was being carried by his soldiers back to Sparta, he found himself surrounded by the enemy. Despairing of his own life, he ordered the rest to make their escape with all speed and to save themselves for the service of their country, but he himself armed and rising to his knees defended himself, killed some of the enemy and was himself slain by a javelin cast.

Sparta would never again be a decisive force in Greek affairs: huge multinational empires like Macedonia, Ptolemaic Egypt, and Seleucid Syria were the masters of the age.

During the next century Sparta became more and more like other Greek cities; the Spartans more or less abandoned their distinctive, ascetic lifestyle and in particular their communistic aversion to private property. Two idealistic young kings, [Cleomenes III (235–222 BC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleomenes_III) and [Agis_IV(265–241) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleomenes_III)tried to revive the old Spartan way of life and restore Sparta to it’s former glory. Cleomenes dies in exile after a military defeat, and Agis was murdered by wealthy aristocrats who didn’t want to live like warrior-monks.
