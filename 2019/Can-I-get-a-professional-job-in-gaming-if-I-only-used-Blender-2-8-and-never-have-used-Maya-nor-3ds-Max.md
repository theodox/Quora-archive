# Can I get a professional job in gaming if I only used Blender 2.8 and never have used Maya nor 3ds Max?

It’s not _impossible_ , but it will be harder.

The likeliest way to get your foot in the door is with a small indie company that doesn’t have a big investment in other tools : if you’re the only artist, you can set your own standards (indie studios, typically short on cash, also like the sound of “free”) .

In big studios, on the other hand, your resume will be handled first by a screener who probably knows little about 3d art — they’ll just be handed a list of requirements that includes the studio’s preferred tools and they’ll probably just skip over resumes that don’t meet the requirements. Games rarely use the raw output of any 3D software — typically there are a lot of in house tools that handle wrangling the data into the right format for the game. Adding all of that one for the sake of one artist with a new program is an expensive indulgence. I have actually seen this done for people whose work was so amazing — or whose political clout was so great — that the studio accommodated them. It’s definitely not standard operating procedure, however.

The good news is that most of the skills you learn in Blender are actually transferable. The hard part of the job is not knowing what button to push, it’s translating 2d designs and vague ideas into well-built models; that’s universal. So, oarticularly for an entry level job it’s OK to submit a reel with mostly Blender work as long as you can honestly say “I’m able to work in Maya/Max as well”. There are [learning editions of both programs ](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/featured)so you can get familiar with the UI and tools.

As long as you are not fluent in whatever a given studio uses, though, you will be at a disadvantage -that’s an unfortunate fact of life. Learning both of the majors as well as a multiple supporting tools (ZBrush, crazy bump, Substance, and so on) is a vital survival skill if you want to make a career as a game 3D artist: I know a lot of folks who don’t think you’re really a “professional” until you can work efficiently in any tool.
