Quintilis is what became July (or rather, _Julius_ ) when it was renamed in honor of Julius Caesar.

If you’re counting, you might notice that Quintilis — ie “Fifth month” — is not actually the fifth month of the year but the seventh. This reflects the fact that the very oldest Roman calendar actually began in March. According to legend it was king [Numa Pompilius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numa_Pompilius) who added January and February to the calendar. In historic times February was moved (!) to its present position in 452 BC.

Despite this, the ultra-conservative Romans retained the March-based numbering of the other months. The number-based month names that survive — October, November, and December — are all off by 2 for the same reason.
