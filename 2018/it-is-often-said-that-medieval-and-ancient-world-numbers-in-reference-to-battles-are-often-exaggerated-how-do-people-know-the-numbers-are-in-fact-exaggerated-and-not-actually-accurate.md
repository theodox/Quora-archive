# It is often said that Medieval and Ancient World numbers in reference to battles are often exaggerated, how do people know the numbers are in fact exaggerated and not actually accurate?

Actually we rarely _know_  it, though we suspect it on a fairly routine basis. It’s not always safe to assume exaggerations, just as it’s not safe to assume the numbers are correct — ancient historians usually have to devote some serious effort to looking critically at the numbers.

Historians generally come to their skepticism in several different ways.

Sometimes, it’s about the text — when you find __wildly conflicting estimates__ or __conveniently symbolic numbers,__ it’s probably good to look more closely. That’s just ancient history 101. Unfortunately we are all to often reliant on a single source, or on multiple sources which all borrow from a single source we don’t have.

Another really common case are numbers which look like __possible scribal errors.__  In one way of writing Greek numbers, the difference between Herodotus’ three million Persians and a more plausible 300,000 is only __αΜτ͵__  versus __αΜλ͵__  (30,000 is __αΜγ͵__ ). Latin numbers are a bit more resistant to this kind of mangling — but only a bit.

Last — but far from least, at least in terms of frequency — sometimes historians simply __doubt__ the story on the grounds of plausibility. Herodotus and his three million Persians, for example, strain credulity on a number of levels. An economic historian might look askance at the food and water requirements for an army that size. A political historian might try to calculate how large a force a given state could afford or could muster. A military historians could try to estimate how large a force could plausibly be managed by the named commanders.

The common thread in all of these cases is that modern observers are frequently ready to second guess ancient numbers. However, recognizing that ancient sources in general aren’t as precise as we’d like is not the same thing as demonstrating that they always lie or that they are all equally (un-)reliable — it’s simply part and parcel of dealing with the evidence of infinitely less bureaucratic times. Given the quality of the sources it’s more or less part of the territory. There are definitely fashions in analysis as in everything else: in the later 19th century it was common to apply very large, almost arbitrary discounts to many ancient numbers, whereas in the last 50 years or so the climate has been less routinely dismissive.
