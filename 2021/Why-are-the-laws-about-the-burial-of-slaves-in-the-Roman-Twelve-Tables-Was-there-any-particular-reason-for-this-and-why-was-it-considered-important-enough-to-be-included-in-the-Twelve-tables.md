# Why are the laws about the burial of slaves in the Roman Twelve Tables? Was there any particular reason for this, and why was it considered important enough to be included in the Twelve tables?

The funerary regulations in the 12 tables are mostly sumptuary laws — they are intended to limit expenditure on funerals, something that many aristocratic clans did in order to enhance their own prestige. The laws are intended to limit this in order to avoid wasteful competition.

> Table X 
1. A dead man shall not be buried or burned within the city.

> 2. One must not do more than this; one must not smooth the pyre with an axe . . .

> 3. . . .three veils, one small purple tunic, and 10 flute-players.

> 4. A woman must not tear her cheeks or hold a chorus of “Alas!” on account of a funeral.

> 5. When a man is dead, one must not gather bones whereby to make an funeral after.

> 6. Anointing by slaves is abolished and every kind of drinking-bout. Let there be no costly sprinkling, . . . no long garlands, . . . no incense-boxes.

> 8-9. A person must not add gold (to the funeral pyre). But him whose teeth shall have been fastened together with gold, if a person shall bury or burn him along with that gold, it shall be with impunity.

The slaves only show up as accessories to an expensive funeral celebration— the kind that might involve a public feast , again a chance for a noble clan to show off with drinks, flower arrangements and incense (a favorite Roman luxury)

it’s worth noting that we don’t have the full text of the 12 tables — modern versions are reconstructions based on quotations from various authors, which means you may find differing versions fore reference. The main points are well known but the language is obscure as well as fragmentary so it’s worth checking more than one translation.
