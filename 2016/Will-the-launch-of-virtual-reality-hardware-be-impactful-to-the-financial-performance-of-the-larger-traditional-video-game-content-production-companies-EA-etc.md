It'll be a while. 

The hardware is awesome but it's not really a mass-market experience yet: the combination of price, technical barriers to entry, and simulator sickness is going to take a long time to overcome in the mass-market consumer space. VR is definitely a thing, and it'll be fairly common in a few years -- but we're still a long, long way from the kind of ubiquity you see with smartphones or PCs. At best -- and I think this is optimistic -- having a VR setup next year will be like having a giant projector-based home theater setup in 1995: you're definitely ahead of the curve but it's going to be a long time before the curve catches up with you.

_It's about 1992_  

For the software companies the payout will be even longer in coming -- as long as there are multiple platforms competing and no completely standard authoring environment the market will be fragmented, which makes it hard to make big money. Larger companies will be able to share some costs (they already publish to Xboxes and PlayStations, after all) and they'll have more clout negotiating exclusivity deals and IP rights for crossovers. However I don't think it'll be a huge market in the immediate future.

One "bright spot" for the near term is that VR -- unlike big AAA games -- has such tight performance constraints that the need for giant teams creating tons of microscopically detailed content is a ways off. Content bloat has been a big problem for the big game companies: _Doom_ was made by what, 22 people in 18 months? _Destiny_ took seven years and peaked over 700 people! As long as VR demands relatively stripped-down content to stave off the simulator sickness there won't be much need for 700-person teams making VR experiences -- or for the huge budgets that come with huge teams.

Of course, when the hardware catches up and the algorithms for predicting and preventing motion sickness are more mature, the bloat will kick in big time. The freer point of view in VR will probably start putting a premium on the kinds of details that we can gloss over in contemporary games. It'll be interesting to see if photogrammetry and other real-life capture techniques become an efficient way to give players the reality they crave, or if the need for rich VR content a decade from now revives the fairly sluggish market for game art content. 

As a content creator, I hope so, but I've learned not to place bets on that.

So for the near term, it's not going to be a significant change to the regular bottom line, except for the expenses associated with R&D and pilot projects. In several years it will start to be a real business for the big guys, though it remains to be seen if it will be a derivative of the game business -- aimed at people at home -- or if it becomes more of a location-based business for arcades and theme parks that can afford to build and maintain dedicated spaces with the equipment needed to provide full 3d haptic experiences and not just head-mounted displays.
