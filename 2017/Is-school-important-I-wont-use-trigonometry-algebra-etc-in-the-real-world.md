If you play video games, you’re seeing a lot of trigonometry every second. I was a _terrible_  geometry student in High School. I’ve had to relearn all of trig and linear algebra — how I wish I had paid attention back then! — because they are fundamental to everything we do in games. Not just graphics, either: AI, navigation, physics — it all comes back to trig and algebra, and a dash of calculus on top.

_Linear algebra in action!_ 

Now that I understand the basics— more or less — I also see how they affect a lot of less fun stuff as well. Certainly its difficult to do anything serious with a computer if you don’t get the fundamentals of math: even if you’re not a programmer and all you want to do is manage a spreadsheet, there’s a lot of carryover from all that stuff which seems so meaningless when you’re just doing homework.

HS math is to the real-world uses of math about like a dribble drill is to playing basketball: boring as hell, but until you master it you’re going to have a very hard time actually winning a game.
