# Why did Thucydides say of Sparta that future generations would find it very difficult to believe that the place had really been as powerful as it was represented to be?

In one sense he was making a fairly banal point about the difference between military and economic power.

The _astu,_ the physical city of Athens was simply a much, much bigger place than the corresponding urban center of Sparta. Athens included two dense urban settlements — the city itself and its port of Piraeus — joined by a large set of continuous fortifications about six miles long. Sparta, on the other hand, was a conjunction of smaller settlements (Limnai, Konoura, Pitana and Mesoa), famously with no wall except the shields of her sons. Although the entire Spartan state was larger than Attica, the population was more dispersed and more rural. Sparta was also not particularly interested in urban ostentation. So, the contrast between the two urban centers was quite obvious to any visitor. There was undeniably a lot more masonry visible if you were standing in the Athenian Agora than if you were in the middle of Sparta. More urban bustle, more public art, more commercial activity…. if you didn’t speak Greek and simply rode through the two cities you’d never guess that they were rival superpowers.

But, by leaning on this physical difference, Thucydides was also making a subtle jab at some of his political enemies in Athens. The democratic-populist faction in Athenian politics was very proud of the large and impressive public buildings created during the two generations which followed the Persian war. Architectural treasures like the Parthenon were a standard bragging point for politicians like Pericles. More conservative, aristocratically inclined Athenians (like Thucydides) tended to remind people of the inconvenient fact that those lovely buildings and statues were built with what was basically stolen money: the funds for the Parthenon and many of the other projects were appropriated from the treasury of the [Delian League](https://www.ancient.eu/Delian_League/#:~:targetText=The%20Delian%20League%20(or%20Athenian,the%20early%205th%20century%20BCE), where they were nominally supposed to be funding the defense of Greece from the Persians rather than a public arts program.

Most of all, though, the original quote __includes a warning to the Athenians__ . The famous observation actually takes place in the midst of a discussion of the Trojan, not the Peloponessian war. Thucydides is making the point that the ruins of Mycenae (still visible in his day) were not that impressive, but that Mycenae was absolutely a Great Power in its day. He gets there by arguing that the war between Athens and Sparta really is a bigger deal than the Trojan epic — but he’s also making a key secondary point: the great, impressive and wealthy city of Troy was laid low by those unimpressive Mycenaeans (oh, and let’s not forget — _Agamemnon of Mycenae’s little brother, Menelaus, was king of Sparta_ ). The Mycenaeans took a long time to conquer Troy, he goes on to say, because they didn’t have a lot of ready money. But in the end, it was those less-urban but rock-hard warriors who burned the topless towers of Ilium.

The short version is, this is not exactly a simple case of “go Athens!”
