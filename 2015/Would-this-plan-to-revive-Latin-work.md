There are not a lot of successful efforts to jump start an entire language. The most notable success story is Hebrew, as the other answers have pointed out. Hebrew had one additional important factor driving its success: the reunited Jewish population of first Palestine then the state of Israel had no other common tongue to fall back on, so the tactical value of a shared language reinforced the ideological and cultural desire to rebuild an otherwise moribund tongue.

By contrast the efforts of the Irish Republic to make Erse Ireland's main language, and the work that many regional governments in Europe to revive minority languages like Welsh, Breton, or Romaunsch haven't had the same kind of success because there was no corresponding practical benefit. Without some real world payoff the likely result is a 'Sunday School' language which most people tolerate grudgingly and resent because it's been foisted on them against their will. I suspect any effort to launch a new language (or revive an old one) will founder unless it offers something of immediate, practical value that it's hard to live without.
