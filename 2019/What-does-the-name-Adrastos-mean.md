Literally it means “not running away.”

Presumably in older Greek it was a positive quality: it’s willingness to stand and fight in battle. It’s a fairly common name in the “heroic age” of Greek pre-history.

However the last famous example is the ill-fated [Adrastos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrastus_(son_of_Gordias)) whose story is related in Herodotus; an unfortunate character who was inadvertently responsible for both the death of his own brother and the son of king Croesus, who had kindly taken him in when he was a lonely exile.

Herodotus also records a very different implication of “won’t run away”:

“when [the Ionians] are considered slaves, they are said to be the most attached to their masters and ones who won’t run away [_adresta_ ]”
