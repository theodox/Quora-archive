Some decades ago a non-western person might have felt that they were missing some ambient knowledge about some of the basic historical, geographical and linguistic facts. When Latin was a widely taught language, and familiarity with art in the classical tradition (such as the plays of Racine and Shakespeare, or the works of Renaissance painters) was expected of an educated person there was a fair degree of background knowledge to draw on. Coming from another culture would, in those days, involve some catch-up work. People with more formal education would probably have read many of the key texts -- Caesar and Cicero, for example -- in the original as part of their schooling, and people in the academic sphere would recognize a lot of names and ideas even if they were not themselves classicists.

Even 50 years ago, though, real expert knowledge was quite rare. Popular imagination had some general tropes but it also included much that was debatable, sensationalistic, or even incorrect: from Nero 'fiddling while Rome burns' to the notion that all Greeks were either purely logical philosophers or pansexual hedonists, the middle-brow view of antiquity wasn't much more accurate than most pop-cultural historical memory. 

These days? You've got nothing to worry about.

I guess there's a question as to whether frank ignorance is a better starting place than a mixture of vague knowledge and common misconceptions. It's admirable that most western schools these days try, at least, to get past their Eurocentric past and provide some kind of 'world history' background -- but that breadth usually leaves kids with a very broad, very thin introduction to all history. My son completed his 'world history 1' course in high school this year, and his class covered Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China, Greece, Rome, and the Arab world in about 2/3 of the school year. I don't think you need to worry about missing something important that other people know: A couple of books -- or even a few binge-watchings of the History channel* -- will be enough to catch up.

One good tactic -- at least, the one that has always worked for me -- is just to pick up whatever comes to hand without worrying too hard about picking the 'right' books or being systematic. Narrowly focused books about an individual or an event can put some real weight into the abstractions you get from overview textbooks; topic-based books (a book on Greek women, or Roman child-rearing, or how the Egyptians ate) are a great counterpart to the kings-and-battles stuff that dominates the chronologically ordered books. Don't expect to get it all at once - soak it in and keep going. Eventually you'll start making connections and seeing it for yourself. And of course, get comfortable with the arguments, disagreements and frustrating lack of evidence. It's fun stuff: fiction can't compete.
 
_* PS: the History channel is good if you feel you're missing out on popular misconceptions. It's not good for much else._
