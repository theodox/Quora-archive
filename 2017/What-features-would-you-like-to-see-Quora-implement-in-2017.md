I’d really like to see __better tools for merging questions__ .

Every time I run across a question that I know I’ve already answered, it’s at least ten minutes of poking around and searching and general frustration trying to find the original answer and merge the questions. I’d say I give up 5–7 minutes in almost as often as I persevere. That encourages the proliferation of dangling questions

Since the merger is quite frequently going to be a person who has already answered the same question it would be a huge help to bias the search results for questions-to-merge-with towards questions the merger has already answered. Since the number of near misses is often so huge this would address the common case quickly.

On a related note: __better searching in your own content__  would be much appreciated. I frequently want to refer back to part of one of my more esoteric answers (like “what’s the word for X in Sumerian” ) but with a long answer log it’s very hard to find them, particularly for users whose answers cluster in a fairly narrow but deep set of topics.
