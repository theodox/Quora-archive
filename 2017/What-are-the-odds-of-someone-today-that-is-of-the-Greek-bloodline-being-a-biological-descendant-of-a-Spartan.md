Given the lapse of time between now and the heyday of classical Spartan, on average every modern Greek will statistically have at least one Spartan ancestor — after something between 80 and 95 generations the number of ancestors you need to account for comes to something like 3.86e+25 — that is 3.86 followed by 25 zeroes. That’s a _lot_  of ancestors.*

In practice the number is much, much smaller than that (it would have to be — that number is millions of times larger than the population of the earth). After a few generations you will start encountering the same ancestor through multiple lines of descent — genealogists know this as [pedigree collapse,](http://www.familytreemagazine.com/article/what-is-pedigree-collapse) since it trims the number of bloodlines very quickly the farther back you go. Even so, the total number of ancestors you’ve got to account for over two and a half millennia is far larger than the population of ancient Greece (which was only somewhere between one and three million in the classical period). Thus, every modern Greek is descended — on average, through many twists and turns — from everyone in ancient Greece.

That’s said, it’s worth pointing out that Spartan blood is distinctly a minority strain in that inheritance.

Sparta was not one of the larger Greek cities: Athens, Corinth and Thebes were far larger. There’s a famous quote to the effect that nobody, viewing the paltry ruins of Sparta, would ever believe that “half the world trembled at the mention of it’s name.” Modern estimates put the population of Sparta the entire Spartan state at about 250,000 in the classical era, but the true Spartans — the elite of warrior-citizens — were a tiny minority. The true Spartans formed less than one-seventh of the population of the Spartan state: they were such ferocious warriors because they ruled over a much larger population of [helots ](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/helot/)(essentially, serfs) and [perioeci ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioeci)(second-class citizens) and they were perpetually on guard against possible uprisings. The ancient estimate was that the Spartan formed about one-seventh of the population of the Spartan state, with the rest being Herodotus quotes the Spartan king Demaratos as saying there were 8000 Spartans in his day, around 490 BC, which would give a total Spartiate class of only about 32,000 including all ages and both sexes. By contrast Athens at the same period had a citizen body of 40,000, and thus about 160,000 including women and children (and about 320,000 if you include slaves and resident aliens).

Modern estimates for the population of classsical Greece vary a lot, from about one to three million people. Out of those millions only about 32,000 were Spartans. So, a modern Greek is statistically the descendant of at least one Spartan — but of far more Athenians or Corinthians… or helots.



How big is 3.86+25? Well, that’s about how many meters there are in 4 million light years. That’s a lot.
