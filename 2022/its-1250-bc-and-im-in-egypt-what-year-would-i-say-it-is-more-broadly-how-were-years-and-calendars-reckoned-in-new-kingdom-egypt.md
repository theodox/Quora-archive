# It's 1250 BC, and I'm in Egypt. What year would I say it is? More broadly, how were years and calendars reckoned in New Kingdom Egypt?

You’re likely to say it’s year [X] of the pharaoh we’d call [Ramesses II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II).

The reason it’s [X] and not a definitive number is that the chronology of this period is not entirely stable. The standard start-date for Rameses II is 1279 BC, which would make 1250 BC into __year 29__ _._ However alternate reconstructions have his starting year in 1290 (in which case it’s “__year 40__ ”) and 1304 (“__year 54__ ” of his very long, 60+ year reign). Egyptian dates tend to be [somewhat debatable all the way down to 663 BC when Egypt was conquered by the Assyrians, whose calendar was anchored in a datable solar eclipse](https://www.quora.com/What-s-the-earliest-historical-event-that-we-know-the-exact-date-on-which-it-took-place-with-certainty/answer/Steve-Theodore) — before that there’s a bit of sloppiness coming from competing king-lists, leap-year problems, and (as you’ll see below) competing ways of counting years. In the 13th century BC the error bar tends to be about +/- 10 years.

Dates were typically written as regnal year - month - day. The Egyptian year started in the month of Ꜣḫt “Thoth,” which ought to correspond to our September 11. However the Egyptian year was a solar year of 365 days without leap years — which meant that the calendar lost a bit more than a day relative to the sun every four years. This is one of the reasons older Egyptian dates can be hard to pin down.

Depending on the use case a date might be written out in full (__year [X] of so-and-so__ ) or simplified (__year [X]__ ) — which can make it hard to tell, sometimes, when an given piece of Egyptian paperwork really comes from.

_This ostracon (potsherd) includes the date “year 21” in Hieratic — but no pharoah is named. It’s believed to be year 21 of Rameses II, which would be either 1258, 1269, or 1283 BC. Photo:_ _[Met Museum](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/558590)_ 

If you did need to distinguish this particular year from a similarly numbered year of a different reign, you’d list the pharaoh’s name — which would present you with a lot of choices, since the pharaoh’s official titles were quite verbose. A [surviving example of a dating formula from year 9 of Rameses’ reign ](https://www.penn.museum/sites/journal/9195/)suggests why you might want to abbreviate the formal date:

> _Year IX, month IV of summer, day I. Live the [HORUS NAME] ‘Strong-bull-beloved-of-Maāt‘; [TWO LADIES NAME] ‘Protector-of-Egypt-conqueror-of-foreign-countries’ ; [HORUS OF GOLD NAME]‘Rich-in-years- great-of-victories’; [KING OF THE SOUTH AND NORTH, SEIZER OF ALL LANDS] ‘Wesr-Maāt-Rā-setep-en-Rā’; [SON OF THE SUN, OF HIS BODY, HIS BELOVED, LORD OF APPEARANCES] ‘Rā-meses-meri-Ȧmen’, be-loved of Ȧmen-Rā, the king of the gods._ 

The name listed here as _‘Wesr-Maāt-Rā_ is the title “Strong Justice of Ra” which the pharaoh took when he ascended the throne; it’s what you’d probably use as a shorthand when you did not want to write the whole titulature. Like a Japanese emperor, a pharaoh was not usually addressed by his birth name (in this case _‘Rā-meses_ or “Ramesses”) in this period.* Incidentally when you filter _‘Wesr-Maāt-Rā —_ or as it’s sometimes transliterated _User Ma’at Re_  — through Greek, it becomes [Ozymandias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias).

However a regnal name does not always remove the complexity. A new king of course cannot be assumed to ascend the throne on Thoth 1, which means that a given point in time can easily belong to a solar year in which two different kings reigned.

The Egyptians never entirely settled on a method of resolving this: sometimes they counted from the first Thoth of a reigning king, and sometimes they began the king’s year on the day of his accession. So a given day could be in year X of the previous king or year 1 of the next one, depending on how a particular scribe approached the problem — a “reign” of two years might last for less than 365 days or more than 731, depending on convention. During the Roman [Year of the Four Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Four_Emperors) Egyptian scribes produced documents dated year 1 of Otho, year 1 of Vitellius, year 1 of Vespasian, and year _2_  of Galba — even though Galba only sat on the throne during the 89 days from June 8 of 68 to January 15 of 69! Since Galba took the throne in the June, his first “year” ended on 1 Thoth of 68 according to at least one scribe.

* Hieroglyphics don’t record vowels — the vowels in the anglicized versions are conventions but the proper transliterations only have consonants and aspiration marks, somewhat like Hebrew. The versions here are a bit old fashioned; the proper transliterations would be the (unpronounceable) _wsr-mꜢꜤt-rꜤ stp.n-rꜤ_ and _rꜤ-msi-sw mri-imn._ More details on the bewildering raft of Ramesses’ titles here:
