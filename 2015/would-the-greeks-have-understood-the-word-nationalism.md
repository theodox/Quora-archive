Not exactly. 

They had a hierarchy of loyalties, starting with local associations like the family, clan or local neighborhood, enlarging to the polis, and expanding to include first their local branch of the Greek world and then the Greek world as a whole. The farther along that line you go, the more diffuse and abstract the loyalties become. 

The Greeks were not very good at subordinating themselves to larger groups. Cities had a hard time cooperating inside of kingdoms or empires and factions had a hard time cooperating inside of cities -- it's one of the reasons that the Greeks never created the kind of long-running, stable empire that the Romans did, despite their other similarities. If you re-read either Herodotus account of the Persian War, or Thucydides version of the Peloponessian War, you'll see that 'national unity' was a weak force in Greek life -- whether it's Greek cities surrendering to (or fighting for) the Persians, or threatening to switch sides out of spite, or factions inside of cities letting invading armies into the city to get back at their local enemies, you can see a common pattern of smaller loyalties winning out of over bigger ones.

That doesn't mean nobody felt pride of nation or attachment to the larger group -- only that it was not a strong enough emotion to guide actions on a consistent basis. Appeals to "Hellenism" -- the common descent and cultural heritage of the Greeks -- were not uncommon and sometimes effective (mythologically, all Greeks were descendants of [Hellen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellen), hence the name) For example, the Athenians intervened to help the Ionian cities against the Persians under Darius partly because of their cultural kinship; much later [Pyrrhus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus) invaded Italy at least in part to "liberate" the Greek cities of the peninsula from the Romans. [Timoleon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoleon) helped the Greek cities of Sicily fight the Carthaginians. In the long struggle to contain Macedonia, the city states tried to cooperate in the name of their common heritage against the half-Hellenized northerners. In all of these cases, however, motives were mixed with self-interest and the usual factionalism.

After Alexander, the concept of Hellenism became even more watered down. Greeks were willing to incorporate non-Greeks who adopted Greek language and culture, at least up to a point; they were definitely convinced of their own superiority to "barbarians" but would extend some degree of respect and cooperation to barbarians who learned Greek ways. It was considered "bad form" for a Hellenic king or emperor to cooperate with barbarians at Greek expense, or to be too open about pushing around the traditional city states in the mainland, which remained culturally important even though they were third-class actors in politics. However again, sentimental appeals to the ideas of Greek brotherhood and liberty didn't mean much in practice: the various Hellenic kingdoms never united to oppose the expansion of Rome or Carthage or Parthia, and even during the final annexation of Greece during the [Fourth Macedonian War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Macedonian_War) the Romans had no trouble procuring Greek allies. 

As a rough analogy, "Hellenism" operated for Greeks about the way the United Nations does today -- there were pan-hellenic forums for argument and diplomacy, shared ideals to which everyone paid lip service but which rarely affected behavior, and common values which rarely led to common action. The ideal was not completely toothless, but it was "soft power" -- fear of looking bad or seeming uncivilized was a real but not overwhelming motivator for Greeks.
