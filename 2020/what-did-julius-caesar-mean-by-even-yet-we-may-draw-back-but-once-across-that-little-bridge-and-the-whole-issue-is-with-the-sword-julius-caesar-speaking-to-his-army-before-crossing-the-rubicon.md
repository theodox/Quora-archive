As long as Caesar stayed on the north bank of the Rubicon, he was just another of the many squabbling politicians and self-seeking generals of the late Republic. Once he crossed that river at the head of an army, he was a rebel, pursuing a private war against his own government.

What he did not say — though of course he knew it — was he could simply have walked across the bridge on his own and gone back to Rome to face trial as yet another of the Republic’s many dubious governors.

While it’s true the Senate’s aristocratic faction was out to get him, they’d have had actually convict him. Given the shakiness of the rule of law in Rome in 49BC, Caesar’s odds were not really that dire. Dubious trials had protected more than a few nominally criminal politicians — including, for example, Caesar’s protege [Publius Clodius Pulcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Clodius_Pulcher).

Caesar’s calculation was probably based more on his guess about where his deteriorating relationship with Pompey was headed. For a long time they had been allies in basically holding the Roman state for ransom, but as Caesar’s star had risen in Gaul Pompey’s power base in Rome had eroded. Pompey had never been a favorite of the aristocrats either but they preferred him to Caesar and successfully made it look like he was backing their vendetta against Caesar. It’s unclear what Pompey himself thought: irresolution was his fatal weakness in politics.

So: crossing the Rubicon was a strange mix of a legal watershed and a political one. The legal transition was of course stark, but it in practice it was more than a bit negotiable, especially given Caesars support within the city. The political transition was, to some degree, based on Caesar’s instincts about Pompey; this was much murkier than the legal boundary but, as events would show, far more impactful.
