It's the foundation of the modern world order. 

The war marked the end or European dominance, with pre-eminent power passing to the US and the Soviet Union. The UN was created in hopes of preventing new wars, but also to create a more inclusive, rule-based international order. The post war settlement set the stage for de-colonisation and globalisation. 

In 1939, most of Africa and large portions of Asia were colonial possessions. The post war period saw almost all of those territories gaining political independence. Some of that is attributable to wartime idealism -- it's hard to fight for the liberty of the Poles or the Czechs while accepting the subjection of the Indians or the Congolese, and the disgusting behavior of the Nazis made many other people re-evaluate their own prejudices. Some of it is attributable to exhaustion: European countries destroyed by war had little energy or manpower to retain control over far-off places. Although the process was long and too bloody, the end result is a much more complex, multilayered world.

The revulsion inspired by the Nazis also changed the way a lot of people think: people on the left and right, who didn't agree on much, could still agree that Fascism needed to end. Many international institutions and laws were created in that moment with the intention of stopping future aggressions and genocides. While these mechanisms don't work as well as they should, they only exist because the coalition that won the war created them.
