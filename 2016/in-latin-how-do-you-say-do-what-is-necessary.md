_age necessaria_ 

[necessarius](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=necessarius&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0060) is pretty much what _necessary_  is in English. Here it’s a neuter plural adjective, but in Latin standing alone like that it becomes a [substantive](http://people.hsc.edu/drjclassics/Latin/general_info_about_grammar/substantive.shtm): it acts like a noun for ‘necessary things’. So the Latin is more literally ‘do the necessary things’. If you want to stay closer to the English ‘what is…’ you could do

_age quod necessest_ 

“Do that which is necessary”
