Although the precise events of Master And Commander are fictional, the period detail and atmosphere are great.

The tv series Rome does a pretty good job with the events surrounding caesar's career. It's particularly good for showing aspects of roman life outside the upper classes, although those characters are fictional. I particularly like that they don't follow the simple Caesar as Mussolini/Caesar as FDR stereotypes that are too easy to fall into. I Claudius, the old bbc show, has a large fictional component but it does catch the flavor of Suetonius (Robert Graves original source) pretty well, although Suetonius is like the National Enquirer of his day.
