There are at least two easy ways to imagine things going bad at Salamis.

The first one is simply that __the Greeks almost chickened out__ . The contingents from the Peloponnese — particularly the Spartans, who provided the fleet commander and the Corinthians, who were the largest contingent after the Athenians. The situation was sufficiently bad that Themistocles had to send an agent to the Persians to “warn” them that the Greeks where about to withdraw, inspiring them to close off the escape route at the western end of the island:

> When the Peloponnesians were outvoting him, Themistocles secretly left the assembly, and sent a man by boat to the Median fleet after ordering him what to say. His name was Sicinnus, and he was Themistocles' servant and his sons' attendant. Later Themistocles enrolled him as a Thespian, when the Thespians were adopting citizens, and made him wealthy with money. He now came by boat and said to the generals of the barbarians, “The Athenian general has sent me without the knowledge of the other Hellenes. He is on the king's side and prefers that your affairs prevail, not the Hellenes'. I am to tell you that the Hellenes are terrified and plan flight, and you can now perform the finest deed of all if you do not allow them to escape.They do not all have the same intent, and they will no longer oppose you. Instead you will see them fighting against themselves, those who are on your side against those who are not.” After indicating this to them he departed. Finding the message credible, they first landed many of the Persians on the islet of Psyttalea, which lies between Salamis and the mainland. When it was midnight, they brought their western wing in a circle towards Salamis, and those stationed at Ceos and Cynosura also put out to sea, occupying all the passage as far as Munychia with their ships.

_Persians (purple) at both ends of Salamis with the Greeks (blue) concentrated at the eastern passage_ 

Thus Themistocles made it impossible for the Peloponessian contingent to withdraw — but if he’d had been less brazen (or if the Persians had been more suspicious of ‘friendly advice’ from Greek commanders) the Greek fleet might simply have evaporated. The Athenians — many of whose families were also refugees on Salamis — had already threatened to abandon the Greek cause and take their 200 ships to Italy if the fleet left Salamis. Eurybiades, the Spartan admiral, was probably relieved to have the choice taken out of his hands.

The other, more tactical way the battle could have turned also relates to that second Persian detachment at the western end of the island. One of the critical tactical advantages that the Greeks had was their __knowledge of the local waters__ . Themistocles knew that the morning wind and tides would be against the Persian vanguard as it entered the straits of Salamis from the east:

> Themistocles is thought to have divined the best time for fighting with no less success than the best place, inasmuch as he took care not to send his triremes bow on against the Barbarian vessels until the hour of day had come which always brought the breeze fresh from the sea and a swell rolling through the strait. This breeze wrought no harm to the Hellenic ships, since they lay low in the water and were rather small; but for the Barbarian ships, with their towering sterns and lofty decks and sluggish movements in getting under way, it was fatal, since it smote them and slewed them round broadside to the Hellenes, who set upon them sharply….

[Plutarch, Themistocles 14](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Themistocles*.html)

But of course the Persian could simply have waited out the _aura_ , the morning breeze. Or, more likely, they could have split their forces more evenly at the two ends of the island. The Bay of Eleusis, west of the battle, is much wider than narrow neck of water where the actual engagement was fought — a better place for the Persians to press their numerical advantage. Forcing the western passage rather than the eastern would also have put the breeze and tide at the Persians’ backs rather than the other way around.

All that said, the real path to a Persian victory was simply __not to fight__ . The Persians could simply have trapped the Greek fleet with powerful blockades at each end of the island and still had enough ships to bypass the Greek defenses at the isthmus of Corinth.

But that would not have been _glorious_ .
