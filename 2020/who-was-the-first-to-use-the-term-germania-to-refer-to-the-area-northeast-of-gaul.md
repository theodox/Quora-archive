It goes back at least as far as the the last generation of the Republic; Caesar uses it as does Cicero and it becomes the cognomen “Germanicus” in the first generation of the empire.

It might be a bit earlier than that — there’s a Greek anecdote about “Germans” ascribed to [Posidonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posidonius), who died before Caesar’s return from Gaul. But my guess would be that the word originates with a Latin speaker (like Caesar) rather than a Greek — apart from that one, indirect quotation Greek usage does not crop up until the first century.
