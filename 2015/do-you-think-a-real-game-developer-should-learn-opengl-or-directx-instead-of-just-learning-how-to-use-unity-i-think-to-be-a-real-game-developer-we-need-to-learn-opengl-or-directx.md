# Do you think a real game developer should learn OpenGL or DirectX instead of just learning how to use Unity? I think to be a real game developer, we need to learn OpenGL or DirectX.

It really depends on what you want to do. 


If you're interested in learning how games 'really work', or if you're hoping to get a job someday as a full time graphics engineer then DX/OGL is important stuff. If you want to make games and get them in people's hands, doing it all from scratch is going to get in the way of actually finishing anything.

 Nowadays nobody (except maybe [Brian Provinciano](https://twitter.com/briprov)) makes games as a sole practitioner. There's a very, very high correlation between the indie devs I know who want to write everything from the audio system to the graphics pipeline themselves and the ones who never finish their games. 

 Wanting to understand all the major systems is admirable, but it's not compatible with shipping an actual game. You won't have equal aptitude for everything; getting good at any specialty takes a lot of time; and in many cases your early efforts won't be competitive. If you do get good you've also got to invest a lot of time in unglamorous things like model export plugins, asset management systems, and packaging systems for different OS'es -- all of which can be very interesting and all of which take time you won't be spending on your game.

So, if you want to be a graphics programmer, learn OGL or DX. If you want to be a game developer, use Unity (or Ogre, Pandas or Pygame or whatever) and pick up the other technologies when you need to in order to realize your goals.
