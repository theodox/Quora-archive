I think the question makes an incorrect assumption.

The degree of Romanization in North Africa was very high, at least in Africa Proconsularis and the coastal regions. Latin [survived as a living language in the region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Romance) at least down to the 12th century. Africans — that is, people of North African heritage — were prominent all over the empire. Among the famous names are:

Emperors [Septimius Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus) (whose father’s family were Punic and Libyan), [Macrinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus) from Mauretania, and the short-lived [Aemilian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aemilianus).

The scholar-king [Juba II ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II)of Mauretania, for whom Augustus arranged a marriage to Cleopatra Selene, daughter of Cleopatra and Marc Antony

The novelist [Apuleius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apuleius)

The playwright [Terence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence)

The orator (and tutor of Marcus Aurelius) [Marcus Cornelius Fronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Cornelius_Fronto)

The Christian theologians [Tertullian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian), [Cyprian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprian), and [Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo).

There are also many less famous Berbers all over the Roman world. The Romans made extensive use of Numidian Berbers as cavalry — Numidians are one of the most common unit designations in the Roman army, and served everywhere from Scotland to Syria.

Roman, Berber, and Punic cultures coexisted for a long time: almost 800 years. There was a lot of gradual assimilation. For example, the decorations on these stelae from Ghorfa, Tunisia are very Roman…

But the form is Berber, like this older example with an inscription in the ancient Lybico-Berber script

It’s true that there were two tracks of Romanization: people living in the coastal regions — heavily urbanized and intimately tied to the wider economy of the empire — were more likely to adopt Latin language and Roman customs quickly. More rural areas, particularly in the less accessible parts of the interior, were less impacted. If you look at the map of Roman cities in North Africa you can see that they are rarely more than 150 miles from the sea:

The archaeological layering of Romanization is very clearly in [Dougga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dougga), which was a Numididan Berber city before the Roman conquest but acquired Roman-style institutions and architecture.

It should be emphasized that the Romanization of Dougga (and North Africa apart from the city of Carthage proper) was not a population replacement. At Dougga there was a settlement of Roman veterans nearby, but it was a separate town, only eventually united with the original Berber city under Marcus Aurelius in the 2d century.

There are similarly “classical” looking Roman ruins all over the old provinces: sites like [Timgad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timgad), [Djémila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dj%C3%A9mila), [El Djem ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Djem)and [Volubilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volubilis) all showcase how extensive the integration of North Africa into the Roman world was.

The long years of North Africa’s Roman prosperity — roughly the first through the fifth centuries — provided a solid foundation for local people to adopt the imperial culture in all its complexity. You can see that complexity in the novelist Apuleius, who set his masterpiece in Greece, even though it’s a story about the Egyptian goddess Isis. The most influential work on Latin grammar in medieval Europe was written by an African, [Aelius Donatus](http://catalog.perseus.org/catalog/urn:cite:perseus:author.529). The Roman empire in the west was nearly brought down by the rebellion of a Berber general, [Gildo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gildo) — but was saved by his loyalist brother (Gildo’s daughter, incidentally, was married into a minor branch of the imperial family. When he fell, his estates were so large that the imperial government created a special office, the _comes Gildoniaci patrimonii,_ to manage them).

In short — it’s not accurate to say that Berbers were outsiders — the Libyans, Numidians, and to a lesser degree Mauretanians were all as well integrated into the imperial system as most other nationalities.

There were, however, also Berber-related peoples living outside of the Roman areas — the most famous being the [Garamantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamantes) of the Sahara and the [Gaetuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaetuli) who lived south of the Atlas mountains. During the civil wars of the third century, and much moreso when the Vandals overthrew Roman rule in the fifth century, these outlying peoples took advantage of the situation and took power in the outlying parts of once-Roman territory. They set up a variety of states in the former Roman realm — but it’s significant that most of them had a [thick Roman veneer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauro-Roman_Kingdom), and they allied with the eastern empire against the Vandals. The chaos in the last century or two of Roman Africa may give a misleading impression of lack of integration — when in fact it was a _disintegration_ .
