Individual ones, yes. Ancient coins were, in the end, hunks of valuable metal bearing a stamp that guaranteed their weight and purity. A [denarius ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius)of Augustus was always going to be as valuable as about seven grams of silver, regardless of the nominal exchange system of the day. The slave-philosopher [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus\), writing in the second century, shows that old coins were still circulating and how cannily they were appraised:

> Whose imprint does this sestertius bear? Trajan’s? Give it to me. Nero’s? Throw it out, it will not pass, it is rotten

A solid coinage whose metal content was reliable was one of the hallmarks of a good emperor. In fact here’s one of those Trajan coins:

That is inscribed with the number 83 by an Ostrogothic money changer in the sixth century. He rated this old denarius as 83 nummi, a nummus being the small change of the system introduced by Diocletian at the end of the third century.

The main danger to a circulating coin was the [habit of Roman emperors of debasing their coins](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Roman-coins-decrease-in-value-during-the-A-D-200s). A spendthrift emperor could melt down a nice pure denarius of Augustus, mix in some less valuable metal, and re-mint the result as two denarii. People generally caught on to the trick — awareness of the relative worth of two nominally equal coins is the point of that quote from Epictetus — but it was very popular. The silver content of Roman coins, for example, declined from more than 90% in the age of Augustus to nearly nothing in the civil wars of the third century.
