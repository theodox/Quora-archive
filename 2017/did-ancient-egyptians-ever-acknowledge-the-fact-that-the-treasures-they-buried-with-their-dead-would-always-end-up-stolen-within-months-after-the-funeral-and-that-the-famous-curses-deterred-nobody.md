# Did Ancient Egyptians ever acknowledge the fact that the treasures they buried with their dead would always end up stolen within months after the funeral and that the famous curses deterred nobody?

I’m not sure about the latter, but the Egyptians were very well aware of the thriving tomb-robbery “industry” and they took serious steps to combat it. [This papyrus](http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/wml/collections/antiquities/ancient-egypt/item-295408.aspx),

for example, records the trial of a tomb robber captured in about 1118 BC while raiding the tomb of Rameses VI, who at that point was only deceased about 30 years.

Among the efforts that were made to protect the tombs was the creation of [Set Ma’at](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_el-Medina), a dedicated “funereal city”: an isolated town near the Valley of the Kings. The people of the town were both the builders and the guardians of the nearby tombs. To keep them honest, they were paid better than ordinary Egyptians. Even better from an Egyptian perspective, their tombs — which they made for themselves in their spare time — were among the finest in Egypt despite their relatively humble status. The was an organized, ongoing effort — its why “within months” is not an accurate description of how soon the tombs were vulnerable.

Still, the workers were exposed to great temptations. Their pay was good, but hardly luxurious — and, around 1156 BC, they staged the first known labor strike when the government shorted their rations. At least [some of the folks in the Valley of the Kings were pretty skeevy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_Salt_124), which suggests that pure religious dread wasn’t the only consideration for the tomb-builders.

_This one is a seamy account of misdeeds and corruption among the tomb-builders of Set Ma’at_ 

As experts in construction techniques, the people of Set Ma’at were also perfectly positioned to be tomb robbers. Fencing was the really hard part, since for most of its history Egypt was a cashless society (the first papyrus above records how the robbers were caught when they quarrelled over the distribution of loot).

The royal government maintained a variety of officials and policemen (typically these were [Medjay ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medjay)tribesmen from Nubia, which helped guard against collusion). Many tombs — including the tomb of King Tut, [which was breached twice](http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/tutrobbery.htm) — have seals from official inspectors listing the known losses and indicating when the tomb was re-sealed.
