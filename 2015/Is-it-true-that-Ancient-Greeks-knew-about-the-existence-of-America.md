[User-10344368986143402877](https://www.quora.com/profile/User-10344368986143402877)' answer covers the sources well.

The likelihood of a map from Alexander's time covering the Americas is extremely low for two reasons: first, very few ancient maps were preserved: most of those that did survive are very schematic outside the eastern Mediterranean (for example the famous 'Ptolemaic map' is a reconstruction by Renaissance scholars based on book data, not a copy of an original maps

As you can see it doesn't extend west of the British Isles - even the Canaries, discovered by the Carthaginians and known vaguely to the Greeks, are barely present as the six little dots at the left-hand margin. Alexander himself never travelled much farther west than Alexandria or Siwa, his career and conquests were mostly east of the Mediterranean. Even then, Greek ships didn't start sailing directly from Egypt to India until the 1st century BC, long after Alexander's time, even though Greeks had been to India overland long before.

Eastern mediterranean traders -- Cretan or Mycenaean, accounts disagree -- are thought to have made it to the British Isles although that is based on archaeological evidence rather than written records. If the [legend of St.Brendan](http://www.history.com/news/did-an-irish-monk-discover-america) has a factual basis, it's possible that any visitors to Ireland or the Hebrides might have encountered stories of a trip from Ireland to Iceland to Greenland to Newfoundland -- but the likelihood that this was a common trip is very low. The vikings were far more accomplished seamen than the Greeks , particularly in open water, but they did not maintain regular contact with North America even though they almost certainly did make the trip.
