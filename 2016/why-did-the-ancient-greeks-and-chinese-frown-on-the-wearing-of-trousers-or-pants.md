Pants are the a very practical innovation for people on horse -back, and they tend to take root among people whose lifestyle is horse-centric. 

If your biggest cultural enemies are horse-back nomads (like the Xiongnu or the Mongols or the Sarmatians or the Persians*) pants have negative connotations for you.



* the Persians were pretty settled down by the time they really collided with the Greeks but their fashion sense was formed on the steppes
