[Abaci and counting tables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_abacus) were common in both Greece and Rome, and faster than written notation for many tasks. [Fractions Tables and multiplication tables](http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/romannumerals/p/RomanFractions.htm) were also used. Romans used 16ths and 12ths as common units to make integer division easier; for other tasks this could be extended to 144ths (12 x 12), "one gross", or 256ths (16 x 16). These systems were great for modular construction, since they provided a lot of options for puzzle-kit construction -- you'll see them also in [Ancient Roman units of measurement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Roman_units_of_measurement).
