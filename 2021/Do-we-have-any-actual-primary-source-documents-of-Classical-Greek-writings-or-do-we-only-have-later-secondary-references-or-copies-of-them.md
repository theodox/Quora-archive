# Do we have any actual primary source documents of Classical Greek writings, or do we only have later secondary references or copies of them?

The short answer would be no: we don’t have originals for any of the classic texts, certainly not for any of the long form literature.

Papyrus — the default writing material in antiquity — has a pretty short lifespan in any climate that’s not a desert. Here’s the __best preserved papyrus ever found in Europe__ dating before the start of the common era.

All of the others only survived by being carbonized — that is, burnt — mostly by the eruption of mt. Vesuvius in 79 AD , in the case of the Derveni Papyrus, by being immolated on a funeral pyre.

Because papyrus is not very durable, almost every text in our classical libraries comes from a copy made in the Byzantine empire, where of course Greek remained the language of literature. Most of the copies we have were done between the 9th and 11th centuries — the invention of modern orthography (capital letters, word spacing, and punctuation) spurred the recopying of the older generation of texts, most of which dated from an equally large wave of copies done in between the fourth and sixth centuries, when bound books replaced awkward scrolls as the archival medium of choice.

Some people take the hard-to-dispute fact that our texts are generally separated in time by more than a thousand years from the time of their original authors and try to spin it into conspiracy theories; the details vary but the gist is always the same: _somebody just retroactively made all of this stuff up at some point!_ 

However despite the lack of complete texts we actually have very good checks on the integrity of our modern versions: if you get a scholarly edition of any classical text you’ll probably skip over the long, dry prologue explaining which later copies were used as the basis, why some variants were preferred over others, and how different editors read disputed passages. Scholars have been studying what we do have intensively for more than 500 years, and they are always on the lookout for clues that indicate a text may have deviated from its originals.

Moreover we often have very good supporting evidence to spot-check the texts which have reached us. Our oldest complete copy of Homer’s _Iliad_ , for example, dates from the 10th century: about 1800 years after our best-guess for when the poems were first written down. But bits and pieces of Homer — quotes by other authors, allusions in painting or sculpture, even graffiti — [turn up in archaeology all the time.](http://kiwihellenist.blogspot.com/2018/07/not-oldest-written-record-of-odyssey.html)

The above is bit of book 9 of the Odyssey from [ms. Plutei 32.24,](http://mss.bmlonline.it/s.aspx?Id=AWOIemvPI1A4r7GxMHzc&c=Homeri%20Odyssea#/oro/171) a tenth century manuscript now in the Laurentian library in Florence. The sixth line is Ἰλιόθεν με φέρων ἄνεμος Κικόνεσσι πέλασσεν / Ἰσμάρῳ, “When I had set sail from there the wind took me to Kikonessian Ismaros” — a line which was founds [scratched onto a potsherd in the Ukraine, in the onetime Greek colony of Olbia, around 1400 years earlier](https://www.trismegistos.org/text/130497).

While we almost never have complete texts earlier than the fourth century we very frequently find fragments — while the European climate is murder on papyrus, desert conditions are much more forgiving so it’s not uncommon for archaeologists to find a page or two of a recognizable work in the rubbish heaps of Greco-Roman Egypt. Most often these are pieces of works we already know, helping us confirm the readings in our much later texts and spot possible areas of divergence; much more rarely they are[ new works which have to be fitted into our understanding of the Greek literary world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichneutae). Desert sites also give us our only real insight into daily life in antiquity: tax records, civil lawsuits, and the mundane machinery of daily governance. We have a far more detailed and nuanced view of everyday life in Greco-Roman Egypt than we do for any other part of antiquity: from a social-history point of view it’s fair to say we know a small village like [Oxyrhynchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyrhynchus_Papyri) far better than Athens, Sparta, or Alexandria.

We also of other ways to check up on what the manuscripts tell us: for example, we can compare Thucydides description of the finance of the Athenian empire to the fragments of the Athenian Tribute Lists, which were inscribed on large stone tablets and later re-used as building material, preserving the large portions of the originals.

We’re are not often that lucky, and we frequently have to use more indirect methods to provide a check on what our texts tell us. Archaeology provides evidence for the spread of goods, sometimes the existence of a particular place or the evidence for a battle or a natural disaster. Coins can show us both the reach of a particular actors, their propaganda themes, and sometimes (through the ups-and-downs of precious metal content) the state of their economies. Once in a while we even find [archaeological evidence of famous figures](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-ancient-artifacts-that-exists-to-this-day-likely-in-a-museum-that-we-with-high-confidence-can-connect-directly-to-a-known-historical-person-Think-Sword-of-Goujian-not-Shroud-of-Turin/answer/Steve-Theodore).

For the most part, however, we work with what we have — remembering to be appropriately skeptical, comparing conflicting versions when possible, and looking for any clues we can to provide a sense of the reliability of different texts and different authors.
