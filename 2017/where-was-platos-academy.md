It was, literally, in the Academy — or more precisely, in the Akademeia (Ἀκαδήμεια), a grove of trees sacred to the hero* [Akademos,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademos) a legendary figure from early Athens. It lay along the river Cephisus, a bit more than a kilometer northwest of the city proper.

The choice of the Academy as a meeting place was important for a couple of reasons. For one thing, it was in the wealthier suburbs of the city — where most of Plato’s pupils came from. For another, it had a historical association with Sparta — during the many Spartan invasions of Attica, they always made a point of sparing the Academy from damage. Plato, who admired Sparta, was almost certainly aware of the implications.
