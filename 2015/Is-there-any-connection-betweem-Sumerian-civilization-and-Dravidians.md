Some scholars do believe that the [Elamites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamthe), the Sumerians' neighbors to the east and perennial rivals, were related to Dravidian cultures. We can't read Elamite very well, so this is mostly hypothetical. The evidence is summarized pretty well here: [Elamo-Dravidian languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamo-Dravidian_languages)
