OK, I’m a lamer but I’m really fond of Latin. I may never be [User-9938525219388766718](https://www.quora.com/profile/User-9938525219388766718), but I can at least manage to interact with Latin at the level of a poorly-educated child, which makes it my automatic favorite compared to all the harder cases. I’m a terrible language student, despite all my longings.

Since so much of the inner logic of Latin lines up with the mental substructure of English, it puts less stress on my tin ear; since so much of the vocabulary is still present in English it’s also less of a strain on my aging memory circuits. The concision of Latin also appeals to my sense of order; it reminds me, in a good way, of programming in Python.

Dealing with Greek, by contrast, I find myself constantly having to grope around for half-remembered rules and structures — [optative aorist, anyone?](https://ancientgreek.pressbooks.com/chapter/47/) — and only very familiar passages feel like “reading” rather than “decoding”. If Latin is Python, Greek for me is C++: I can manage when I must, but I’ve always got a lot of open tabs in my browser when I have to get something done.

Latin and Greek, of course, both unlock a lot of great literature and interesting primary source material so they come with enormous libraries of things to read. One of the lesser-known benefits of Latin is the huge wealth of neo-Latin literature from the 15th through the 18th centuries — whether it’s Newton’s _Principia Mathematica_ or the sublime goofiness of [Athanasius Kircher](http://kircher.stanford.edu/), there’s always something interesting to play with once you’ve paid your dues to Cicero and Caesar.

Farther down the chain, I get a kick out of puzzling through something really hard, like a short fragment of cuneiform or a name in hieroglyphics. However at that remove I can’t really call those “languages” at all: the act of decrypting a bit of these things is fun and interesting but it’s CSI forensic science, not reading. I’ll never be able to sight read any of that.

On the long list of things I wish I had time to learn, Akkadian is probably the top to-do since it unlocks so many interesting things. However I doubt I’ll ever have the time to crack it for real — I imagine it would be a lot easier for somebody who spent a lot of time in Hebrew School as a kid.
