The [last known hieroglyphic inscription ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffito_of_Esmet-Akhom)dates from the year __394__ .

However by that point the hieroglyphic tradition had been in decline for a very long time: Roman-era writers from Egypt in the first and second centuries are often very badly misinformed about hieroglyphics; the last “manual” of hieroglyphics, attributed to [Horapollo](http://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/hh/index.htm), is mostly junk information but was widely circulated — which means not only was there poor knowledge of hieroglyphics but that not enough people knew or cared to correct the misinformation.

That’s not to say that Egyptians were illiterate. Between the first and third century all of the traditional writing systems (hieroglyphs, [hieratic ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieratic)and [demotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian))) were replace by the [Coptic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_alphabet), which is derived from Greek characters but is used to write the Egyptian language. Since by that point Egypt had been administered by Greek-language bureaucrats for almost five hundred years it made a lot of practical sense for Egyptians to use a Greek-like alphabet for practical purposes.
