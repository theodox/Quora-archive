# Is the absence of any mention of the Hittites from the Iliad evidence that the Trojan War happened much, much earlier? I.e. Before the second Hittite empire?

To the extent the Iliad reflects the historical realities of 12th century BC Asia Minor, it’s a post-Hittite world. An actual Achaean warlord of the 12th century BC was almost certainly quite aware of the Hittites, even if they were rather far away (Homer uses “far away” for nations like the Lycians and Ascanians, much closer to the Greek world than Hattusas). However they were not, at the time conventionally assigned to the fall of Troy, the dominant power they had been a century earlier. The Hittites were severely defeated at [Nihriya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nihriya) in the 1230’s, which undermined Hittite dominance and triggered revolts during the reign of [Šuppiluliuma II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0uppiluliuma_II), the last Hittite king.

So, it’s easier to imagine the Trojan war as a scramble for position among different groups which had once been Hittite clients or tributaries as the Hittite state fell apart — something like a Bronze Age version of the collapse of Yugoslavia. The traditional date for the fall of Troy in 1184 BC coincides quite nearly with the destruction of Hattusas (~ 1180) after a generation of instability.
