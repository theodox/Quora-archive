# Are there any families in Rome who can realistically claim lineage all the way back to ancient Rome (i.e. Rome before 400 AD)?

The best candidate I know of is the [Balbi Family](http://www.balbifamily.com/balbisfamous.htm), which has been claiming since the Renaissance to be descended from either [Marcus Atius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Atius) or [Lucius Cornelius Balbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Balbus_(consul)) — who, ironically, was a Roman only by courtesy: he was from Gades (Cadiz) in Spain, and was most likely of Phoenician descent.

It’s pretty likely that this line of descent is fabricated: a lot of history intervened between the days when Balbus was Caesar’s money-man and the documented roots of the Balbi family tree in the 1400’s. But you never know. I’d like to think it’s true, particularly since it means a slice of the Italian upper-crust are all a bunch of crypto-Carthaginians: divine irony at its finest.
