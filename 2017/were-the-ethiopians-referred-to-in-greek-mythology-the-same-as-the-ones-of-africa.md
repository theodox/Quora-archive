Yes and no.

Αἰθίοψ (“Aethiops” ) means “burnt-face” in Greek, and in some contexts it’s as close as they came to a quasi-racial classifier like the modern US use of “black”; they used the term pretty sloppily but most often it means pretty much anybody with dark skin. So, while it was most frequently used for Africans it was also used for, say, some people from India — it didn’t help that some Greeks believed that the Indian Ocean was landlocked, and that Africa curved around to the east and joined up with India somewhere. One of the earliest “black” characters in Greek literature, [Memnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memnon_(mythology)), reflects the confusion: about half the time he’s depicted as coming from India, and the rest of time he comes from Africa or Egypt.

In other context, they specifically used “Aethiopia” to refer to African regions they knew best, which would be modern Sudan and Ethiopia. After Alexander’s conquest of Egypt there was a good deal of interchange between Greeks living there and people farther up the Nile, particularly the [Kingdom of Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush) and later the [Kingdom of Aksum. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum)The Axumites were linguistically related to modern Ethiopians, speaking a Semitic language, but the Kushites were closer to modern Sudanese.
