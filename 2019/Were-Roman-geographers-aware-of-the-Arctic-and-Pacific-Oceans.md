To the north they were aware of the North Atlantic, and to the east the South China Sea and the Java Sea.

The Greek adventurer [Pytheas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pytheas) circumnavigated Great Britain and Ireland and possibly visited Iceland. He was aware of things like floating sea-ice and the midnight sun at midsummer — both of which his Greek and Roman readers found very hard to believe. However there was little economic reason for Roman-era travellers to head so far north; even Ireland was only vaguely known and the locations of areas farther north were not recorded. The most comprehensive surviving ancient geographers don’t record any observations farther than about 60º north.

To the east, Roman traders appear to have visited Indonesia and the eastern shores of Indochina and Guangzhou. However, relatively little evidence of that shows up in our literary sources. The farthest eastern point that’s explicitly recorded is probably the city known as [Kattigara](https://www.academia.edu/2086769/Kattigara_of_Claudius_Ptolemy_and_%C3%93c_Eo_the_issue_of_trade_between_the_Roman_Empire_and_Funan_with_Kasper_Hanus_), which has been tentatively identified as [Óc Eo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93c_Eo) in the Mekong river delta.
