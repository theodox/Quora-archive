Sumerian appears to be a language isolate with no living relatives. We’ve got a pretty good sized corpus of Sumerian literature, since Sumerian was carefully preserved as a literary language by subsequent Mesopotamian cultures; it doesn’t reveal any clear and relationship to other languages, living or dead.

The main reason for suggesting that Sumerian might be related to a Dravidian language is that Sumerian is agglutinative, which Dravidian languages tend to be as well. However there are other agglutinative language families too: there is a school of thought — [which tends to overlap rather heavily with Turkish nationalism](http://www.sumerianturks.org/sumerian_turkish.htm) — that suggests that Sumerian is related to Turkish. Indeed, if you google that one you’ll discover the idea of Sumerian as a Uralic language has, rather peculiarly, become a hot topic among neo-Nazi groups as well… An odd fate for the history of the [sag-gig-ga, the “black headed people”](https://saggigga.wordpress.com/2010/11/14/the-black-headed-sumerians-sag-gig-ga/). So, you’ll definitely find a variety of _suggested_  affiliations for Sumerian, but none of them is non-controversial and none commands majority support among linguists.

A somewhat more common though similarly tentative hypothesis is that [Elamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language) is ancestrally related to Dravidian languages. However this situation here is quite similar to that with Sumerian; the family relationships with other tongues are either not there at all or incredibly faint.
