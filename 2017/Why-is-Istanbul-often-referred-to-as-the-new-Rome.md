That was [actually one of it’s official names](https://www.quora.com/What-was-Constantinople-called-before), at least after Constantine made it the real center of the Roman Empire in 330. The city remained the capital of the Roman Empire* for more than another thousand years, though during that time it was more often called _Constantinople_ , the city of Constantine.

_Istanbul_  comes ultimately from the Greek _eis tin polin “into the city” ._ It didn’t become the city’s official name until the 1920s.



*in English, we say ‘Byzantine’ for the empire after 476; but the people who lived their still called themselves Romans until the Turkish conquest of 1453 — and, in many cases, down to the 19th or even 20th century.
