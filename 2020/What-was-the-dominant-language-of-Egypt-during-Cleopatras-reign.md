In the literal sense of “dominant”, it was Greek — that was the language of government, law and commerce, and of the colonial social elite of which Cleopatra was the head.

However the _majority_  language was a form of [Late Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Egyptian_language). Over the course of the Ptolemaic kingdom and on into the Roman era the spoken language was evolving into what eventually became [Coptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language). Some people refer to the phase of the language during this time as [Demotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)), though you can make a case that “Demotic” refers to the non-hieroglyhic form of writing that was in use from about 600 BC - 400 AD rather than the spoken language. Coptic remained the majority language of Egypt until around five hundred years ago.

It’s worth noting that Late Egyptian was fairly different from the language of the Middle Kingdom and before (before around 650 BC). The old form of the language survived as a prestige language, for use in things like temple inscriptions and literary contexts — but it was quite distinct from the language of ordinary Egyptians long before the Ptolemies showed up. The [loss of interest in Hieroglyphic writing ](https://www.quora.com/How-and-when-did-hieroglyphics-vanish/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=6b024d7a&srid=zLvM)probably has a good deal to do with the fact that Middle Egyptian was about as distinct from the language of Cleopatra’s day as today’s Italian is from Latin.
