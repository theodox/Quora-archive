He was the last man standing after a wrenching civil war; he had a lot of enemies. Some were principled opponents of one man rule. Some were avenging fallen friends or family. Some were against his populist politics (although the picture of him as a champion of the dispossessed against the powerful is highly debatable). Some were just competitors: ambitious noblemen who knew that Caesar would never surrender the monopoly on high office and prestige that most aristocrats thought of as their primary reason for living.
