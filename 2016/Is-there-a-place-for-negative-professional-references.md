In the States, at any rate, about the only way to get real negative information is in face-to-face conversations. Rightly or wrongly most companies feel that any negative commentary on former employees is an invitation to a possible lawsuit. Even though such suits are, in fact, pretty rare -- not many people are dumb enough to demand a publicly recorded trial in which the other side is trying to prove that they are incompetent, toxic, or irresponsible -- the potential costs associated with even going to trial lead most companies to have a strict 'no disparagement' policy. If there were a 'glassdoor for people' it would be a lawsuit magnet.

The strongest evidence for negatives is the one-sentence 'yes s/he worked here'. If you check with a former colleague and that's the only thing they'll admit to in writing, the odds are good that the relationship ended badly. Most former employers will offer a lukewarm endorsement or list a few positives. However it's not really fair to infer much from silence: a generic response from an HR person may be purely pro-forma, where a non-endorsement from a close former colleague actually means something.
