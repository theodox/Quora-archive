Not by Roman law, no. Rome, after all, did not recognize plural marriage, and Caesar was still married to [Calpurnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calpurnia_(wife_of_Caesar)) when Caesar was killed as readers of Shakespeare will recall.

Despite Caesar’s tremendous sense of entitlement, even he was sensitive to the political issues arising from a marriage to the ruler of a foreign state (he had plenty of experience in this area — he was also romantically linked with the queen of Mauretania and, in a rather different context, with king Nicomedes of Bithynia). The political fallout of Mark Antony’s later marriage to Cleopatra suggests that Caesar was right to be cautious. It is possible that Caesar was contemplating something more above-board, perhaps to accompany his campaign in Parthia where he’d have been dependent on Egyptian supplies. According to Suetonius at least one of Caesar’s pet tribunes drew up a bill allowing Caesar to marry as many wives as he wished. However the bill never actually became law. It’s tempting to think that the idea was in circulation during Cleopatra’s last visit to Rome and was cut short by Caesar’s assassination — but we can only speculate.

It’s not clear what if any legal footing the relationship had in Egypt. As an absolute monarch, Cleopatra was probably free to do or say whatever she wished in her own realm — although the famously inbred Ptolemies had their own reservations about allowing outsiders into their family circle. It’s worth pointing out that there are no surviving Ptolemaic coins which hint at a marriage. In contrast, Cleopatra’s later dalliance with Mark Antony produced a lot of coinage like this:

_Cleopatra, left, and Antony, right — one of many Egyptian coins which featured the couple._ 

On a related note, Caesar never legally acknowledged Cleopatra’s son Caesarion, who is usually described as Caesar’s only known son. Some authorities say he allowed Cleopatra to add his name to the boy’s, but even that may have been Cleopatra’s own initiative at home. His full Greek name was_Ptolemy Philopator Philometor Caesar — “Ptolemy Caesar who loves his father and his mother”_ — which strongly suggests that Cleopatra saw a lot of value in associating the boy with Caesar’s legacy. When Mark Antony threw in his lot with Cleopatra, he also embraced that idea as a way of proving that he and Cleopatra represented the true “heirs” of Caesar’s party. Octavian and his allies, however, always denied the claim.

> Finally [Caesar] called [Cleopatra] to Rome and did not let her leave until he had ladened her with high honours and rich gifts, and he allowed her to give his name to the child which she bore. In fact, according to certain Greek writers, this child was very like Caesar in looks and carriage. Mark Antony declared to the senate that Caesar had really acknowledged the boy, and that Gaius Matius, Gaius Oppius, and other friends of Caesar knew this. Of these Gaius Oppius, as if admitting that the situation required apology and defence, published a book, to prove that the child whom Cleopatra fathered on Caesar was not his.

_Suetonius, Life of the DeifiedJulius, LII_ 

However the fact of the debate shows clearly that Romans didn’t recognize a marriage or regard Caesarion as a legitimate offspring. He was not mentioned in Caesar’s will.

So — Caesar never married Cleopatra in a way that Romans recognized. She was free to make whatever she pleased of the relationship in her own realm but there’s reason to think she didn’t legally marry Caesar under Egyptian law either.
