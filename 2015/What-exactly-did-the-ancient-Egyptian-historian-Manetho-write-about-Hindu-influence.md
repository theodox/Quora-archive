Manetho wrote a history of Egypt, focusing primarily on establishing a systematic record of the pharaonic dynasties. He also covered some elements of traditional Egyptian religion. Living under the Greek dynasty of the Ptolemies, he followed the Greek tradition that many Greek gods were merely "aliases" for Egyptian ones. He also wrote a book on Egyptian religion, and one criticizing Herodotus' account of Egyptian history. Unfortunately all of these survive only in small fragments.

As far as I know, there's no mention of Hinduism anywhere in there (the likeliest term for a Hindu to someone writing in Manetho's day would have be [Gymnosophist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnosophists), but I don't see that anywhere in the text.). It's possible some other author interprets something in Manetho as a Hindu borrowing or syncretism, but if so it's pretty sketchy. 

The surviving fragments are here:
