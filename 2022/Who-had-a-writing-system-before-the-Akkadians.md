The Akkadians borrowed their system from the [Sumerians](https://omniglot.com/writing/sumerian.htm). There is intense debate about whether cuneiform or Egyptian hieroglyphs are “first” , both of them evolving into true writing before the turn of the fourth millennium BC, but in any case the Akkadians are only in third place at best. If the [Indus Valley script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_script#Early_Harappan) is a true writing system — likely but unconfirmed — Akkadian drops back to fourth place.
