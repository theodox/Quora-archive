Like most cultures they had a lot of different words for mental acuity, although they didn't have one that exactly corresponds to [intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence) in modern English (which is, of course, a contested definition as that links shows).

One big difference is that the Greeks would not have tried to quantify intelligence as a single faculty: the seem to have had their own version of the 'multiple intelligences' theory, and had a pretty rich vocabulary for describing the different faculties of the mind.

__[Nous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nous)__ ____ is the closest word to "intelligence" but it is more correctly translated as "mind". Sometimes it means just "mental activity", or "intelligence" in the way we might discuss the intelligence of dogs or horses; but for Plato and Aristotle it is the part of the soul which perceives abstract truths. It was not, however, a measurable quantity -- you would not have a nous quotient -- it was a faculty or aspect of human thought.

___phronesis___ meant "practical wisdom", "good judgement" or what we might call "common sense". A smart merchant or a wise statesman displays _phronesis_ because he understands human nature and how to work with it.__ Like common sense, there's a vague understanding that this is also a moral category: you would probably not describe a clever criminal as having _phronesis._ The classic example is Pericles, a brilliant politician and leader who could move people to do his will because of his _phronesis:_ his understanding of human motivation and political necessity.

Related is ___phrontis___ __,__  "concern" or "reflection". This sometimes had a slightly ironic connotation -- similar to the way 'concerned' can imply 'smarmy'. When Aristophanes made fun of philosophers, he invented the _phrontisterion_  or 'house of concerns' for them to live in and it became a joke name for an over-intellectualized social set. Lawrence of Arabia had the words '_ou phrontis'_ carved on the lintel of his door -- they referred to the Greek story of Hippocleides, who got drunk and made a fool of himself in front of a powerful would-be father in law. Told he was ruining his prospects, he replied _ou phrontis_ or _'not concerned!'_  

___metis___ is another form of practical wisdom, what we would call "cunning". It is similar to _prhonesis_ in that it is based on a knowledge of how humans behave, but it is manipulative and deceitful rather than seeking the common good. The classic case is Odysseus, often called _polymetis_  or "most clever", who uses his cleverness to deceive and defeat his enemies. Interestingly Athena, who we are usually told is the goddess of wisdom, is the daughter of _Metis_ , the personification of cunning; it's easy to see the inheritance in the Odyssey and Iliad, but in classical times she was sometimes called _Athena Phronesis_  -- this may reflect the change from the warrior ethics of Homeric times to the more civil code of the classical age. In any case, _phronesis_ and _episteme_ were the virtues of thinkers and would-be statesman, but _metis_ was the virtue most applauded by the average Greek.

___episteme___ __ meant "understanding" or "knowledge", with the implication that the understanding was rationally founded, in contrast to mere opinion or hearsay. It's similar to the 18th or 17th century usage of _science_  in English. This is a highly valued trait, in some ways the highest form of intelligence; it's believed to be the achievement of only a few elite thinkers. Ordinary people instead have ___doxa,___ _"received opinions"._ 

___gnome___ is what we might call "wisdom" or "insight"-- a sympathetic understanding, or "emotional intelligence". It's the same root as the famous commandment [Know thyself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself) (γνῶθι σεαυτόν). Gnome is direct, intuitive knowledge, not reasoning -- the [Gnostics](http://gnosis.org/gnintro.htm) were a school that stressed immediate personal connection with the divine.

___techne___ is "technical skill." Unlike _phronesis_  it is purely concerned with getting things done, with the excersize of intelligence to achieve a physical goal: it's the skill of a carpenter, a ship builder, or an architect. In the Greek context this was the least important aspect of intelligence: political sagacity and abstract reason were more highly valued than skill with tools, engineering, or mechanics. _Techne_  is also divorced from moral considerations: the craft of a safe-cracker is a _techne_ .

If you want to read up in depth, Aristotle's [Nicomachean Ethics](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.1.i.html) and Plato's [Republic](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.1.introduction.html) both contain different discussions of cognition and how it relates to human life.
