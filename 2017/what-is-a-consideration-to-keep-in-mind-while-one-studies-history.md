[Anthony Molho](https://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/HistoryAndCivilization/People/Professors/Molho) told me one thing I’ve never forgotten:

_“The past is another country._ ___They do things differently there___ _.”_ 

Don’t travel in time like a stereotypical bad tourist, complaining about the accommodations and how poorly organized everything is.

Don’t be one of those people who just gets on and off the tour bus at scheduled stops, eats at the restaurants most like those at home, and blabs on your twitter about how stupid the locals are. Or, for that matter, don’t be the kid who returns from junior year abroad and can’t stop talking about how superior life was “over there” and how inferior everything at home is.

Before you decide what you think about the dead, take the time to shut up and listen — particularly, listen to them speaking for themselves. Try to see the humanity under the alien clothes and mannerisms, the complexity and contradictions under unfamiliar ways of talking. Good travelers are willing to defer their judgments, to see nuances and shades of gray. Above all, they’re more interested in the richness and variety and surprises of what’s in front of them than they are in passing judgement.
