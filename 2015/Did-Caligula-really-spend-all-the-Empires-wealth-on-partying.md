Well, not really. There was clearly money left over for Nero to blow on his own amusements, and even Nero didn't bankrupt the whole empire. The physicality of wealth in the Roman world made modern levels of debt hard to achieve - especially if you had your own army and a habit of confiscating the wealth of anybody who caught your eye.

The historical picture of most emperors before the Antonines is complicated because of seems clear that our best sources are fairly hostile: [Suetonius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suetonius) was addicted to spicy gossip and seems to have had sources that were prone to hostile exaggerations, particularly about the Julio-Claudians and [Tacitus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus) was an embittered republican who had no patience with emperors. As Tacitus himself said:

> The facts of Tiberius', Gaius' and Claudius' as well as Nero's reigns were, counterfeited out of fear while they lived and colored by still fresh resentment when they fell.

That doesn't mean that everything they say is untrue but it means we are definitely seeing a jaundiced picture of the early emperors (apart from Augustus, who gets more sympathy even though Suetonius portrays him as a tool of Livia).

But, all that said, the misbehaving emperor is a definite trope of Roman life, particularly in the first century of the empire.
 
The transition from republic to monarchy was pretty traumatic; traditional Roman values were the mores of a competitive political aristocracy who had to embody a certain level of public gravitas if they wanted to succeed and advance the fortunes of their families. In the imperial era, those restraints no longer mattered: success at court demanded the skills of courtiers and yes-men rather than the discipline of public service. The courts filled up with favorites, informers, and groupies while the emperors themselves had no effective checks on their behaviors. The modern analogy is the way celebrity tends to drive people a bit insane (anybody born to the purple was effectively an ancient child star, with all the temptations and incentives to misbehavior of a Justin Bieber). It took a long time for the Romans to develop a new value system that could keep their rulers more or less honest.
