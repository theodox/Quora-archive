Actually most fertile geographical region for emperors is the Balkans -- for two hundred years the military nerve center of the Empire was along the Danube and, since the Romans had a penchant for military coups a disproportionate number of (usually short-lived!) emperors came from the camps of Dacia or Illyria. 

By the mid third century Italians were a distinct minority - after 250 only [Tacitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Claudius_Tacitus), [Valentinian II ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentinian_II)and [Valentinian III ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentinian_III)were born in Italy (and the Valentinian family tree, through Theodosius, goes back to Spain). 

Many of these 'provincial' emperors had -- or claimed to have -- origins in the traditional Italian aristocracy by way of Roman colonies or extended service abroad; but the trend from the late second century onward was strongly towards successful professional soldiers and away from aristocrats. [Rome didn't do a great job of ensuring peaceful succession of the throne](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires) -- but at least that kept it from being an ossified system of inherited privilege.
