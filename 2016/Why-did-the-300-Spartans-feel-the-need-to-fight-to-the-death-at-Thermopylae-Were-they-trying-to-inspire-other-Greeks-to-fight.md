# Why did the 300 Spartans feel the need to fight to the death at Thermopylae? Were they trying to inspire other Greeks to fight?

[Achilleas Vortselas](https://www.quora.com/profile/Achilleas-Vortselas) has the gist of it. To amplify what he said -- and to underscore the depth of the Spartan ethic of loyalty -- consider Herodotus' account of the only two Spartans who survived the battle (VII.229):



> It is said that two of these three hundred, Eurytus and Aristodemus, could have agreed with each other either to come home safely together to Sparta, since Leonidas had dismissed them from the camp and they were lying at Alpeni very sick of ophthalmia, or to die with the others, if they were unwilling to return home. They could have done either of these things, but they could not agree and had different intentions. When Eurytus learned of the Persians flank attack, he demanded his armor and put it on, bidding his helot to lead him to the fighting. The helot led him there and fled, but he rushed into the fray and was killed. 

> Aristodemus, however, had lost his strength and stayed behind. 

> Now, if Aristodemus alone had been sick and returned to Sparta, or if they had both made the trip, I think the Spartans would not have been angry with them. When, however, one of them died, and the other had the same excuse but was unwilling to die, the Spartans had no choice but to display great anger towards Aristodemus.... 

> When Aristodemus returned to Lacedaemon, he was disgraced and without honor. He was deprived of his honor in this way: no Spartan would give him fire or speak with him, and they taunted him by calling him Aristodemus the Trembler. In the battle at Plataea, however, he made up for all the blame brought against him. 

>  It is said that another of the three hundred survived because he was sent as a messenger to Thessaly. His name was Pantites. When he returned to Sparta, he was dishonored and hanged himself. 

At the [Battle of Plataea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plataea) the next year, when the Greeks defeated the Persian army, Aristodemuss fought with suicidal bravery in the front ranks. However Spartans, stern as always, regarded his death in battle as only a partial redemption of his honor ( IX.71):

> when there was a general discussion about who had borne himself most bravely, those Spartans who were there judged that Aristodemus, who plainly wished to die because of the reproach hanging over him and so rushed out and left the battle column behind, had achieved great deeds -- but that Posidonius, who had no wish to die, proved himself a courageous fighter, and so in this way he was the better man. 

>  This they may have said merely out of jealousy, but all the aforesaid who were killed in that fight received honor, save Aristodemus; he, because he desired death because of the reproach previously mentioned, received none.
