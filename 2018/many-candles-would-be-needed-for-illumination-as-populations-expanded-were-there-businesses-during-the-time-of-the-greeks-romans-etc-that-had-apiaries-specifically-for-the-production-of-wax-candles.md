# Many candles would be needed for illumination as populations expanded. Were there businesses during the time of the Greeks, Romans, etc. that had apiaries specifically for the production of wax candles?

Domestic illumination was a big, industrial scale business in Roman times anyway — but at least as far as our evidence goes it was [oil lamps ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Lucerna.html)that furnished the primary means of lighting houses.

There were both tallow candles (_sebacei_ ) and wax candles (_cerei_ ). Candles were, however, regarded as the illumination of the poor while oil lamps were the “modern” alternative — the Roman poet Martial described the wax candle like this:

> Hic tibi nocturnos praestabit cereus ignes:
 Subducta est puero namque lucerna tuo.

> This taper will provide you with light in the night, 
when your lamp has been stolen by your servant

And also said of an ornate oil lamp (still called a _candelabrum_ )

> Nomina candelae nobis antiqua dederunt:
 Non norat parcos uncta lucerna patres.

> Candles that gave us our old name;
Our forefathers didn’t know the oiled lamp

Beekeeping was a well-known industry in Roman times (and pre-Roman as well — the Etruscans were big beekeepers). However the main Roman source on bees, Pliny’s [Natural History](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D4), doesn’t make any special mention of candle-wax.

On the other hand archeology provides [abundant examples of cheap, mass-produced oil lamps](http://www.archeobo.arti.beniculturali.it/modena/viale_reiter_fornace/factory_08_en.htm). These were typically made of terracotta, produced in from pre-made molds in huge quantities.

_Mass produced oil lamps, showing their brand names. The “Fortis” brand was apparently particularly popular — archaeologist have found knock-off copies in various parts of the empire._

They are so abundant that Roman originals [can be found on E-Bay ](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=roman%20lamp&ssPageName=GSTL)by the dozen.
