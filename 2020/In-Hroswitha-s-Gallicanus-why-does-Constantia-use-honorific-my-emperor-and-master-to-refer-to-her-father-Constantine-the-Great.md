“Lord” is probably a less distracting translation than “master” in this case. _Dominus meus_ , “my master” or _dominus noster,_ “our master” would have been very familiar in the Hroswitha’s Ottonian world.

In the early Roman empire it was a controversial form of address: in Republican Latin, _dominus_  meant primarily “slave master” — for a freeborn Roman to use it to another was a stark confession of inferiority. After a couple of centuries of imperial rule, however, it had become fairly normal (the first emperor to use it openly was the despotic Domitian (reigned 81–96), and by the end of the third century it was a common honorific, appearing for example on coins and in the salutations of letters. It’s frequently abbreviated DN. Given the long lifespan of ancient coins (which were valued for their metal content, not their face value) it’s far from impossible that she had seen coins like this:

_A coin of Constantine. The reverse at right reads DN CONSTANTINUS MAX[imus] AVG[ustus] “Our lord Constantine the great emperor”_ 

In Hroswitha’s monastic context _dominus_  would be very familiar: it’s the word which we translate in English as “Lord” — and like _Lord_  it can be mentally capitalized (_“_ Lord, have mercy_”)_ or merely a polite status marker (“your tea and crumpets, my lord”). In some medieval contexts its not much more honorific than “sir”.

One thing that might make this scene stand out to Hroswitha’s contemporaries but which is lost on us is the fact that — despite the title — Constantia is actually being pretty _informal_ with her father. Hroswitha’s [surviving letters to emperor Otto ](https://epistolae.ctl.columbia.edu/woman/7.html)are much, much wordier and more formal:

> Mighty sovereign of the empire of the Caesars,
Otto, who with the favoring piety of the eternal king,
magnificent in the scepter of imperial honor, surpass all previous emperors,
whom many nations living far and wide fear,
and the Roman world endows with various gifts.
Do not scorn the small gift of this song,

> Pollens imperii regnator caesariani,
Oddo, qui regis pietate fovente perennis
In sceptris augustalis praeclarus honoris
Augustos omnes superas pietate priores,
Quem plures gentes passim metuunt habitantes,
Muneribus variis Romanus donat et orbis!
Exiguum munus ne spernas carminis huius,

Late-Latin oratory was extremely florid and bombastic; compared to the actual forms of address expected in a public context “my lord,” scarecely registers. A well educated woman like Hroswitha will have been very familiar with the interminable forms of address that were regarded as high style in her era, so a mere _domine mi_ is clearly a simple form of respect, not a serious formal salutation.
