If you are not a specialist, you will likely run out of steam trying to manage the unabridged version.

Gibbon’s level of detail is very impressive but a bit wearisome; also, if you aren’t familiar with his source material the accumulation of footnotes can make it all seem a lot more unassailable than it really is. You should probably bookend it with a modern history of the same period in any case, unless you just like the majesty of his Olympian prose — ultimately _Decline_  _and_  _Fall_  is more valuable as literature than history these days.
