Phoenician, or perhaps more correctly Punic — that is, the language of Carthage and the other Phoenician derived settlements in the western Mediterranean.

Punic actually left a fair amount of other epigraphic remainsas well. They tend to be fairly dull — a lot of stuff like listing the names of a committee who paid for a temple restoration, or brief tombstone inscriptions — but there are a few Latin-Punic bilinguals as well. If the cippi had not already helped to crack the code in the 1700’s it’s likely that one of the North African examples, which started to emerge in archaeological work during the 19th century, would still have made the decryption possible.
