A child inherited the legal status of its mother— if she were a slave, the child would be as well. If she were a freedwoman, the child would be a full citizen. This produced some [very complicated families](https://www.academia.edu/29492367/Liberta_uxor_mater_The_role_of_freedwomen_in_the_Roman_family) — the parents might be free and the children slaves, the parents might be freedpeople, the children full citizens. Here’s an example of an extended family:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b9c790d331d55cdd8955dd3d2fd2da5c)

_Mutilia Nothis, freedwoman of Lucius, arranged this monument for her son Nothus, slave banker of Lucius Selicius Geminus, 23 yearsold; for her son Quintus Sallustius Ianuarius, freedman of Quintus; for her husband Hesperus, slave of Caius Orbius Quartus. An unusually complicated family with a free woman, children who had been born slaves, and a husband (_ a coniunx_, a term which didn’t really imply legal marriage) who was still a slave._ 

Among ordinary people, it was not that uncommon for a male owner to free and then marry a female slave; their children would be free assuming he followed the correct legal order and had the manumission recorded before the birth. This kind of manumission was common enough that it was excepted from laws (in the early empire) which were intended to limit the rate of manumission generally.*

It’s worth pointing out that marriages between free men and (formerly) slave women was not common among the wealthy people who dominate our literary sources. Aristocrats contracted their alliances very carefully, with an eye toward political or economic gain, not for passion or romance. An aristocratic male owner who had a romantic attachment to a female slave would not be likely to marry her — though he might free her to ensure their children were born free, and might later adopt them if he had no legally recognized heirs.

A female owner could likewise manumit and marry a male slave — though again, this would be very unheard of in the upper reaches of society. It would have to be handled through the proper legal form: it was illegal for a free woman to voluntarily cohabit with a man who was still enslaved. Very late (in 468, only a decade before the western Empire went into abeyance) marriage between a woman and her freedman was legally prohibited.

Given the [sexual component of slavery](https://www.quora.com/In-Ancient-Rome-Ancient-Greece-or-other-ancient-slave-owning-societies-did-anyone-ever-buy-a-slave-in-order-to-have-sex-with-him-her-Are-there-records-of-this/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=640c0b7b&srid=zLvM), there were often children born as slaves in the household of their biological fathers. Not all house-born slaves (known as [vernae](https://feminaeromanae.org/vernae.html)) were the masters’ children, but many were. Vernae were usually seen as a privileged group: sometimes praised for their loyalty, sometimes derided as pampered favorites. We do see evidence that vernae were often freed, in fact it was not uncommon for a former verna to mention the fact on their tombstones as a mark of status:

_To Juno, on behalf of his beloved wife Dorcas of Capri, a freed verna of the empress and a lady’s maid, Lycastrus the clerk [her] fellow freedman [commissioned this monument]. A Roman inscription of the first century_ 

but — lest we be too sentimental about it — it’s clear that some were also sold out of the homes they were born to.

You can get a good sense of the complexities of the relationship in this poem of Martial, written when he was selling his farm:

> _Hic festinata requiescit Erotion umbra,_ 
_crimine quam fati sexta peremit hiems._ 
_quisquis eris nostri post me regnator agelli,_ 
_Manibus exiguis annua iusta dato:_ 
_sic lare perpetuo, sic turba sospite solus_ 
_flebilis in terra sit lapis iste tua._ 

> Here rests Erotion’s hurried shade, robbed
of life by fate and her sixth winter. Whoever
owns this little plot after me, make an offering
to her small ghost each year. Then, may your
household endure, safe and untroubled.
Let this stone be the only sorrow on your land.

Epigrams X, 61

Erotion was a Martial’s verna, and may very well have been his daughter.

_To the gods below: Philetaerus, an imperial freedman and a tutor of the imperial children, made this for Florentina, his verna, who well deserved it. A second century inscription by a former slave to a verna in his own household._ 



* The complexity of possible family arrangements also meant there was an exception to the law for manumitting “blood relatives” — these might be the children of masters who were legally slaves because of their mother’s status, or they could be the children of freedmen who subsequently inherited “ownership” of their own children from their former masters.
