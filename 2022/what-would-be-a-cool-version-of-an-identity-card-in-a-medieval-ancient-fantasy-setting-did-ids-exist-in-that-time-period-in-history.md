# What would be a cool version of an identity card in a medieval/ancient fantasy setting? Did IDs exist in that time period in history?

if the goal is to identify yourself — not necessarily to the government, but simply to guarantee that you are who you say you are — seals stamps are a common tool. They come in many forms: rings with unique designs, stamps like those you’d see in an old fashioned library, or little cylindrical rolls that could be threaded onto a necklace.

This one’s a modern repro — [you can get it on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1104096093/ancient-greek-roman-babylonian?gpla=1&gao=1&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_us_a-jewelry-necklaces-charm_necklaces&utm_custom1=_k_Cj0KCQjw4uaUBhC8ARIsANUuDjU-D8Zou3Smau-toJ7Y-E3hS_TDGm-lL3VNwrVzJM9o3A5f6b8KUEQaAqfiEALw_wcB_k_&utm_content=go_12570713223_121181970642_507439359557_aud-459688892115:pla-352964544853_c__1104096093_122769679&utm_custom2=12570713223&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4uaUBhC8ARIsANUuDjU-D8Zou3Smau-toJ7Y-E3hS_TDGm-lL3VNwrVzJM9o3A5f6b8KUEQaAqfiEALw_wcB) — but it gives a good idea of how it works. If you gave somebody an example of the stamped image they could verify a future message came from you, but it would be very hard to reverse engineer.

Ancient governments rarely went in to “ID cards” — the cost of creating and storing such information was very high in a world without printing or cheap paper. However when there was money on the line permanent records were often inscribed on metal plates for durability. A Roman soldier was granted full citizenship and some retirement benefits after mustering out from the legions; naturally he and the government both had reasons for wanting proof of his status. So he’d be given a [diploma](http://www.romancoins.info/MilitaryDiploma1a.html), a hinged bronze tablet recording the relevant facts and holding a seal. Back at Rome the soldier’s name would be inscribed on a bronze tablet along with all the other retirees of his year.

By doublechecking the name and the seals an official could verify that the possessor was entitled to veterans benefits. This was a very important document and the owner would protect it fiercely — it would _not_ be the sort of thing you carried in your wallet, its more likely you’d only produce it to get yourself enrolled as a voter, or to demand a citizen’s appeal in a trial, or to prove ownership of your land grant.

Generally speaking in Greek or Roman times your real identity protection was a social network. Traveling to a new area without a network of family friends to vouch for you was dangerous — away from people who knew you, the chance of being kidnapped into slavery or victimized by local officials looking for a payout was quite real. “[Guest friendship](https://co-geeking.com/2019/05/13/guest-friendship/)” (_hospitium_ in Latin and _xenia_  in Greek) was a key part of any ancient person’s identity; anywhere you went you’d want to be under the protection of somebody with a tie to your family who would vouch for you to local authorities, help you out in difficulties, and generally make sure you got around safely. The modern idea that the state was an abstract guarantor of your individual rights was very much absent.
