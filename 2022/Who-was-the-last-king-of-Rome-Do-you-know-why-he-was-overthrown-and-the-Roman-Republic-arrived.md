Traditionally it is Tarquinius Superbus, “Tarquin the Arrogant.”

The most familiar version of his story is set out by the Roman historian Livy (full thing [here, starting from book 1, ch. 49](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a49)). It’s a good read, and has been the basis of most retelling of birth of the Roman Republic for the last two thousand years.

Here’s the short version.

Tarquin was an unpopular king who treated his subjects badly. He ruled as a tyrant, without respect to the rights of his subjects. He was also an Etruscan, rather than a Roman, so his personal failings were magnified by linguistic and cultural differences. The last straw in his relationship with the Romans came when his son raped [Lucretia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretia), a Roman noblewoman. She accused him publicly and then killed herself, which ignited an uprising among the Romans that drove out Tarquin and his supporters.

[Lucius Junius Brutus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Junius_Brutus) and [Collatinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Collatinus) led the Romans in overthrowing the tyrant. When victory was won they created the first institutions of the Republic, particularly the split executive system which made sure there were always two consuls — an insurance against the rise of a single, all-powerful leader in the future. Traditionally these events happened in 509 BC.

This is the traditional story, which has been the subject of many poems, plays, and artworks down the centuries (for example, Shakespeare’s _[Rape of Lucrece](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/Poetry/RapeOfLucrece.html)_ ). Unfortunately for us, there is no easy way to know how much of it is historic: the oldest surviving written accounts of Roman history are more than two centuries later. No matter how interesting and dramatic the traditional story is, we have to assume later generations have added their own spin on the events of the actual Roman revolution. In addition to the lapse of time, Rome itself was largely destroyed by the Gauls at the beginning of the fourth century BC: if there were any authentic records of the first days of the Republic they are unlikely to have survived that catastrophe.

So, for lack of better evidence we continue to retell the traditional stories — but we take then as better evidence for what Romans of much later centuries told themselves, rather than as definitive descriptions of what exactly happened in 509. There is archaeological evidence that makes a date around that time seem plausible — but the details are regarded with healthy skepticism.
