You can do it - but _don't_ do it informally. 

 If you've got a lawyer, you can get something drafted; if you don't, try to write something clear that makes it obvious that people can't expect ownership of the things they post. No matter what, there needs to be a a clear legal disclaimer as part of the sign-up or forum header or something so that nobody can claim they didn't know you were going to use their idea or say that they were promised some kind of compensation for making a suggestion.

A different way to do that is to put the whole project under an open source license. Especially if you're doing it for learning or as a solo project that will give an obvious, legally binding template that is unambiguous. It will, however, mean other people can use your ideas in the same way you're proposing to do with your players.

The sad part is that the odds of anything negative actually happening because you did the eminently human thing and said 'I've got this project, what do you guys think?' are small . Unfortunately they are not zero. And the costs if something does go wrong can be way out of proportion to the benefits. That's why so few commercial entities do what you're proposing.
