“Classical” (pre-Alexandrine) Greek ships didn’t mount missile weapons; their primary weapon was the ram and their tactics centered on maneuvering to use the ram. The classic trireme was long and lean, optimized for speed and would not have made a good missile platform. In fact the armored marines on the ship were typically expected to sit down when not actively engaged in boarding, to avoid destabilizing the ships.

The earliest known reference to projectile weapons on Greek ships is Alexander’s siege of Tyre in 332 BC. This was a brutal amphibious operation in which both sides tried innovative tactics. Alexander’s new-minted fleet (a mix of Greek ships from Cyprus, Phoenician ships from Sidon, and a smattering of others) seems to have invented mounted missile weapons primarily as an aid to attacks on the land fortification, not for ship-to-ship fire.

It’s not recorded, but it’s likely that the missile weapons at Tyre were limited to the new, larger ship classes (quadriremes and quinquiremes) which were just beginning to appear: the first quinqireme was designed for Dionysius I of Syracuse around 400 BC. These were designed for bigger, but less skilled crews and oriented towards boarding rather than ramming: where an Athenian trireme might have 15 marines, a quinquireme might carry 120.

Moreover in the Hellenistic kingdoms the trend toward larger, stouter and more heavily armed ships accelerated — [gigantism complemented the outsized egos of the successor kings](http://www.hellenicaworld.com/Greece/Technology/en/GiantShips.html).

These larger ships were often unwieldy, but they did support increasingly powerful and sophisticated artillery pieces: the Syracusan flagship dubbed the _Syracusan_  was said to have required as much wood as sixty old-fashioned triremes. Its main catapult was claimed to be able to throw a an 18′ long projectile weighing ~180 lbs / 78kg a distance of 210 yards (192 m). Unfortunately for Hieron of Syracuse, who spent a fortune on the monstrous vessel, it was too large for any of his harbors: he ended up giving it to the Ptolemies as a diplomatic gift.

_A reconstruction of the_ _[Leontophoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leontophoros)_ _, an enormous octareme with 1600 rowers and 1200 marines. In this hypothetical reconstruction it mounts 12 ballistae._ 

There are not a lot of good records of ship-to-ship missile combat in the Hellenistic period, but the aim seems was primarily to have been to injure enemy rowers (thus limiting the enemy’s ability to maneuver) rather than to sink ships outright. The most popular use of shipborne catapults however was for supporting amphibious siege warfare. The Romans eventually devised a grapnel bolt for their catapults, the [harpax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpax), which could be used to pull an enemy ship closer for boarding.

__Bonus points:__ Not specific to the question, but the description of the _Syracusan_  deserves to be quoted in full for it’s vivid description of Hellenistic shipbuilding priorities. TLDR: practicality was definitely _not_ one of the key virtues. From _[Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae 206 ff.](http://www.attalus.org/old/athenaeus5b.html)_ 

> Hieron, the king of the Syracusans, who was in every respect a friend to the Romans, was very attentive to the furnishing of temples and gymnasia; and was also very earnest in ship-building, having built a great number of vessels to carry corn; the construction of one of which I will describe. For the wood, he caused such a number of trees to be cut down on Mount Aetna as would have been sufficient for sixty triremes, and when this was done he prepared nails, and planks for the sides and for the inside, and wood for every other purpose that could be required, some from Italy and some from Sicily. And for ropes he provided cordage from Spain, and hemp, and pitch from the river Rhine; and he collected great quantities of useful things from all quarters. And he collected also shipwrights and other artisans. And having appointed Archias the Corinthian the superintendent of them all, and the principal architect, [207] he bade them labour at the construction with zeal and earnestness, he himself also devoting his days to watching its progress. And in this way he finished half the ship in six months; and every part of the vessel as soon as it was finished was immediately covered over with plates of teal. And there were three hundred workmen employed in working up the timber, besides the subordinates whom they had to assist them. And it was arranged to draw this portion that was done so far down to the sea, that it might receive the last finishing strokes there. And when there was a great inquiry as to the best method of launching it into the sea, Archimedes the mechanician launched it by himself with the aid of a few persons. For having prepared a windlass [ helix ] he drew this vessel, enormous as it was, down into the sea. And Archimedes was the first person who ever invented this windlass. But after the remainder of the ship had also been completed in six months more, and it had been surrounded all round with brazen nails, the greater part of which weighed ten minae, and the rest were half as big again - (and they were driven in through holes made beforehand by gimlets, so as to hold the planks firm; and they were fastened to the wood with leaden plugs; pieces of cloth being put under, impregnated with pitch) - after, I say, Hieron had completed the external figure of the vessel, he laboured at the interior.

> And the vessel was constructed with twenty banks of oars, and three entrances, having the lowest entrance leading to the hold, to which the descent was by two ladders of many steps each; and the next was contrived for those who wished to go down to the eating-rooms: and the third was for the armed men. And on each side of the middle entrance were apartments for the men, each with four couches in them, thirty in number. And the supper-room for the sailors was capable of holding fifteen couches, and it had within it three chambers, each containing three couches; and the kitchen was towards the stern of the ship. And all these rooms had floors composed of mosaic work, of all kinds of stones tesselated. And on this mosaic the whole story of the Iliad was depicted in a marvellous manner. And in all the furniture and the ceilings and the doors everything was executed and finished in the same admirable manner. And along the uppermost passage was a gymnasium and walks, having their appointment in all respects corresponding to the size of the vessel. And in them were gardens of all sorts of most wonderful beauty, enriched with all sorts of plants, and shaded by roofs of lead or tiles. And besides this there were tents roofed with boughs of white ivy and of the vine, the roots of which derived their moisture from casks full of earth, and were watered in the same manner as the gardens. And the tents themselves helped to shadow the walks. And next to those things was a temple devoted to Aphrodite, containing three couches, with a floor of agate and other most beautiful stones, of every sort which the island afforded. And its walls and its roof were made of cypress-wood, and its doors of ivory and fragrant cedar. And it was furnished in the most exquisite manner with pictures and statues, and with goblets and vases of every form and shape imaginable.

> And next to that was a drawing-room capable of containing five couches, with its walls and doors made of boxwood, having a book-case in it, and along the roof a clock, imitated from the sun-dial at Achradina. And there was also a bath-room, capable of containing three couches, having three brazen vessels for holding hot water, and a bath containing five measures of water, beautifully variegated with Tauromenian marble. And many rooms were also prepared for the marines, and for those who looked to the pumps. And besides all this there were ten stalls for horses on each side of the walls; and by them the fodder for the horses was kept, and the arms and furniture of the horsemen and of the boys. [208] There was also a cistern near the head of the ship, carefully shut, and containing two thousand measures of water, made of beams closely compacted with pitch and canvass. And next to the cistern there was a large water-tight well for fish, made so with beams of wood and lead. And it was kept full of sea-water, and great numbers of fish were kept in it. And on each side of the walls them were also projecting beams, placed at well-proportioned intervals; and to these were attached stores of wood, and ovens, and baking places, and mills, and many other useful offices. And all round the outside of the ship ran colossi [ atlases ] six cubits high, which supported the weight which was placed above them, and the triglyph, all being placed at convenient distances from one another. And the whole ship was adorned with suitable pictures.

> And in the vessel wore eight towers of a size proportioned to the burden of the ship, two at the stern, and as many at the head, and the rest in the middle of the ship. And to each of these were fastened two large beams, or yards, from which port-holes were fixed, through which stones were let down upon any enemy who might come against the ship. And on each of the towers stood four young men fully armed, and two archers. And the whole of the interior of the towers was full of stones and missiles. And a wall, having buttresses and decks, ran all through the ship, supported on trestles; and on these decks was placed a catapult, which hurled a stone weighing three talents, and an arrow twelve cubits long. And this engine was devised and made by Archimedes; and it could throw every arrow a stade. And besides all this, there were mats composed of stout ropes suspended by brazen chains; and as there were three masts, from each of them were suspended two large yards bearing stones, from which hooks and leaden weights were let down upon any enemy which might attack the vessel. And there was also a palisade all round the ship, made of iron, as a defence against those who might attempt to board it; and iron ravens, as they were called, all round the ship, which, being shot forth by engines, seized on the vessels of the enemy, and brought them round so as to expose them to blows. And on each of the sides of the ship stood sixty young men clad in complete armour; and an equal number stood on the masts, and on the yards which carried the stones; and they were also on the masts, up at the mast-head, which was made of brass. On the first there were three men, and on the second two, and on the third one. And they had stones brought up to them in wicker baskets by means of pulleys, and arrows were supplied to them by boys, within the defended parts of the mast-heads. And the vessels had four wooden anchors and eight iron ones. And of the masts, the second and third were easily found; but the first was procured with difficulty among the mountains of the Bruttii, and was discovered by a swineherd. And Phileas, an engineer of Tauromenium, brought it down to the seaside. And the hold, although of a most enormous depth, was pumped out by one man, by means of the screw, an engine which was the contrivance of Archimedes. And the name of the ship was 'The Syracusan;' but when Hieron sent it to sea, he altered its name and called it 'The Alexandrian.'
