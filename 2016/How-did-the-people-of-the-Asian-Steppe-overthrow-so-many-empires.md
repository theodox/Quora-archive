There’s a lot of detail in each case. The Mongols stand out from the rest of the steppe peoples for their remarkable discipline and professional approach to warfare, but until the 16th or 17th century the pattern of nomadic peoples riding roughshod (literally) over settled societies that we would consider more “advanced” is a recurrent motif that has many common featurs. Even if you skip the tactical things (double-recurve bows, hardy horses, etc) the nomads always possess some significant strategic assets.

__Manpower.__ 

Prosperity and social hierarchy tend to make people specialize: there are not likely to be many tax lawyers, parfumiers, pastry chefs, or manuscript illuminators hanging around the Khan’s yurt in a nomadic society. And more to the point, a lot of urban civilizations take significant pains to de-militarize their agricultural labor force.

Converting those peacable specialists into fighters in not a trivial task even if you try it: look at the amazing infrastructure that was needed in the age of mass mobilizations just to feed, clothe and house draftees. This means that the large advantage in population that urban societies enjoy is heavily offset when they confront a nomadic adversary: if 80% of your population are civilians, you need to outnumber your enemies by 5 to 1 just to break even on the battlefield with a society in which pretty much every adult male is expected to fight. For comparison purposes, consider the Germanic invasions of the first century BC: between them the [Cimbri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimbri) and the [Teutons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teutons) fielded more than 300,000 warriors; the Romans had to resort to emergency measures to field half that number against them. At that time the Roman empire included Italy, Spain, Sicily, most of North Africa, Greece, and western Asia Minor.*

_Turning urbanites into soldiers is expensive and time consuming_ 

To top it all off, not all would-be soldiers are created equal. The denizens of a civilian world are probably not as well suited for a life of sleeping rough and fighting as nomads whose entire lives consisted of… sleeping rough and fighting.

__Mobility__ 

In the case of the steppe peoples in particular, the ready availability of mounts and riders was a key advantage. All other things being equal a cavalry force is 50% faster than marching soldiers in an unforced march. In an emergency, a horse-borne army can do far better: when the Mongols invaded Hungary in 1241 they managed as much as 100 miles a day for short bursts: utterly beyond the capacity of the footsloggers. Moreover a society like that of the Mongols, lavishly provided with horses, can rotate mounts for their riders keeping them in better condition (Mongol warriors typically brought three to five horses apiece)*. This meant that the cavalry arms of sedentary peoples had a hard time keeping pace.

_24 miles a day_

_36 - 100 miles per day_ 

Of course, in agricultural lands there are lot of landowners who don’t want your horses feeding in their fields, which puts some limitation on the ability of urbanized governments to field — and to feed — big cavalry armies. If you’re planing on grazing your horse on the _enemy’s_  fields, though, the logistics are simpler.

__Concentration__ 

Obviously, an army which can outmarch its rivals by 50% is hard to bring to battle. The logical countermove is defense in depth: if you can’t catch the enemy in the open you build walls or forts to slow him down. Unfortunately this makes defense very expensive: you have to maintain many soldiers who will never see a fight _if things go right_ . It’s somewhat analogous to the asymmetry between airport screeners and would-be terrorists: defending everywhere at once is very, very expensive and it tends to cede the strategic initiative to the other side.

Down the years the pattern of nomadic conquest repeats itself many, many times. There’s a good case to be made that the upper hand didn’t really pass into the hands of ‘civilization’ until the gunpowder era, when all of those cultural intangibles which urban life provides suddenly assumed a concrete form that no horse (or camel) borne society could match. It can’t be stressed enough, though, that the link between ‘civilization’ and military might — which seems so obvious to us — was much weaker in the pre-industrial era.

_The cossacks were still a force to be reckoned with in the_ _[Polish–Soviet War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War)_ _of 1919–21 — which looked surprisingly like the cavalry epics of earlier ages._ 



_* granted, they had other commitments too — but the disparity is still pretty shocking._ _[Marius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_reforms)_ _had to remodel the army to include classes of people that had hitherto been deliberately excluded from the armed forces… with very serious implications for the future course of Roman history._ 

_** It’s worth pointing out that our perception of the relative wealth of nomadic and settled societies is thrown off by the nature of the good each society had. In 4th century Rome, for example, a high quality horse cost as much as four or five slaves. This means most Mongol warriors tramped around with the equivalent of a 20-person payroll : far more than the average spear-carrier in a settled society could hope to afford._
