The fetial spear isn’t a particular kind of spear, it’s a spear used for a very specific purpose.

Early Rome — three or four centuries before Caesar — was noted as a place where strict observance of ritual (critics called it “superstition”) was regarded as extremely important. A lot of Roman tradition hinges on the bad things which happen if you don’t follow the proper procedure, like the [notorious admiral who lost his fleet because he disregarded the omens provided by his sacred chickens.](https://thehistorianshut.com/2018/09/14/the-disgraced-ancient-roman-admiral-who-did-not-heed-the-sacred-chickens-during-the-first-punic-war/)

The [Fetials ](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Fetiales.html)were a college of priests whose role was to oversee the proper ritual initiation of a war — a role which usually involved them in some diplomatic capacity as well. In theory they were supposed to lay out the Roman claims against a potential enemy and invite a negotiated settlement. Other Italian city-states had similar officers, and when things went well, the corresponding diplomat-priests would hash out a peaceful agreement. At the end of a war the fetials were also responsible for the ritual conclusion of a treaty.

If the Fetials could not reach an agreement with a potential enemy, they would enact a ritual intended to legitimize a coming war. An ultimatum would be delivered three times: first, to the an enemy civilian met on the road; second, in the enemy market place; and lastly in front of the enemy magistrates. The fetials would pray to Jupiter, laying out the basis of their claim against the enemy and demanding fair redress. The enemies were given 33 days to reply.

If the enemy didn’t come to terms within the 33 day window, the fetials would proceed to the border with a ritually consecrated spear — the fetial spear of the question. The spear’s tip would be hardened in fire and wetted with blood — ritually signifying the start of destruction and bloodshed. Following another set of prayers, hostilities would formally commence when the chief fetial threw the consecrated spear across the border into enemy territory.



Livy (1.24) preserves an account of the Fetials in action which is probably rather embroidered but which does give the flavor, including the very strict ritual formulas. Given the role of herbs and flint knives it’s likely that elements of this ritual are very, very old:

> The fetial asked King Tullus, “Dost thou command me, King, to make a treaty with the pater patratus of the Alban People?” Being so commanded by the king, he said, “I demand of thee, King, the sacred herb.” The king replied, “Thou shalt take it untainted.” The fetial brought from the citadel an untainted plant. After this he asked the king, “Dost thou grant me, King, with my emblems and my companions, the royal sanction, to speak for the Roman People of the Quirites?” The king made answer, “So far as may be without prejudice to myself and the Roman People of the Quirites, I grant it.” The fetial was Marcus Valerius; he made Spurius Fusius pater patratus, touching his head and hair with the sacred sprig. The pater patratus is appointed to pronounce the oath, that is, to solemnize the pact; and this he accomplishes with many words, expressed in a long metrical formula which it is not worth while to quote. The conditions being then recited, he cries, “Hear, Jupiter; hear, pater patratus of the Alban People: hear ye, People of Alba: From these terms, as they have been publicly rehearsed from beginning to end, without fraud, from these tablets, or this wax, and as they have been this day clearly understood, the Roman People will not be the first to depart. If it shall first depart from them, by general consent, with malice aforethought, then on that day do thou, great Diespiter, so smite the Roman People as I shall here to-day smite this pig: and so much the harder smite them as thy power and thy strength are greater.” When Spurius had said these words, he struck the pig with a flint.
