In general, our ideas about formal address reflect the history of the middle ages. Classical antiquity did not use respect-forms like “your highness” — there was not, in fact, even a Roman equivalent of “sir” or “mister” until quite late. Originally Romans greeted each other by name: “hello, Marcus Tullius” or the like.

We don’t have any evidence for the usage in the Roman Kingdom. The likeliest cases there would probably _rex_ (“King”). It’s likely that the kings also expected _Dominus, “lord.”_  However it became taboo after the revolution which created the Roman Republic.

In the early imperial period, there was no set form of address — no equivalent of “your highness” or “your majesty.” The earliest emperors tried to pretend that they were nothing more than particularly respected citizens, and they were especially careful to avoid the titles of _rex_ and _dominus_  because those were considered un-Roman. In these early years of the emperor _Caesar_  was a safe choice because it affirmed the charade that the emperor was just another Roman and could be addressed by name. However, within a couple of generations “Caesar” had transformed into a title as the Julian family died out — but “Caesar” as a form of address remained and would for as long as there were emperors to address. Other safe titles to use would be _Princeps_ (“first man”) _,_ or _Imperator_ (“emperor” or “commander”). For very formal occasions you might use _Augustus_  (“revered one”), a title which early emperors generally picked up somewhere during their reigns, or _Pater Patriae,_ “Father of the country”.

Around the second century _dominus_  became acceptable in private addresses to the emperor. The term was losing some of its sting, eventually becoming not much different than “mister” . In public it was still avoided, though — one of the worst sins attributed to the tyrannical emperor Domitian was openly using _dominus_  as a title. Another mark of the increasingly exalted status of the emperors was the habit of adding adjectives to the title: _potens Caesar, “_ powerful Caesar,” or _Imperator optimus,_ “greatest emperor” and so on. Some emperors seem to have used standardized adjectives (_invictus,_ “invincible”, was a popular one) in bureaucratic contexts like oaths.

In the middle imperial period the forbidden _dominus_  becomes openly used — by the mid-third century it is completely conventional: _dominus noster_ , “our lord” appears on coins and inscriptions as simply _DN._ The flattering adjectives, include more and more quasi-religious ones like _sacer,_ “sacred” or even _deus_ , “divine”. They also started accumulating in number. Long form flattery got worse and more cringeworthy; by the third century public speakers addressing the emperors were delivering [short-story length flattery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panegyrici_Latini) of unbelievable windiness.

The society of the later empire grew increasingly formal: it was less and less common to address important people by name in the old Roman manner. By the fourth century or so the Late Roman bureaucracy became extremely complex, and developed a [bewilderingly elaborate set of ranks and titles](http://www.hellenicaworld.com/Byzantium/LX/en/ByzantineAaristocracyAndBureaucracy.html). Each of these had a carefully prescribed form of official address associated with it: Starting in the fifth century you begin to see familiar ones like _amplitudo tua,_ “your greatness” or _celsitudo tua,_ “your highness.” However [the “your abstract quality” form of address was not originally used for emperors, but rather for highly placed officials ](https://books.google.com/books?id=rzE2o0uM_HAC&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq)(the examples above were for the _magister officiorum_ , the head of the imperial civil service).

In Byzantium the titulature became ever more baroque as the court became increasingly ceremonial — my personal favorite is the Greek [Panhypersebastos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panhypersebastos), πανυπερσέβαστος, “super venerable above all,” which wasn’t even for the emperor: it was for his son-in-law. In the west, with no Emperor presiding the old fashioned fourth and fifth century titles remained in use. Eventually a new set of protocols evolved which led, over the next thousand years or so, to the modern system. The “kings” of the west — who, for a long time, were fictionally at least functioning as officers of the empire governed in Constantinople — retained titles of upper-level bureaucrats which real emperors would have scorned.
