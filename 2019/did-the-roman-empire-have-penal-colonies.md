Not in the Australian sense.

__Under the Republic__ 

As far as we know exile was only the statutory punishment for a handful of political crimes (mostly _[ambitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambitus)_ , tampering with an election or a jury) . Exile was, nonetheless, a fairly common outcome in some kinds of cases.

In the Republic, it was surprisingly hard for a Roman citizen to receive a death sentence from the state: tradition demanded that in most cases a convicted Roman citizen be allowed to flee and not pursued.* In some crimes an explicit sentence of _[aquae et ignis interdictio](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/aqua-et-igni-interdictio-e130020)_ _, “_ prohibition of fire and water” meant that the condemned had to get out of Roman territory if they want to go on living, though the state made no effort to help or hinder their flight. So, in the Republic exile was effectively a self-directed condition, it didn’t matter where you went so long as you were outside a stated distance from the city.

__Under the Empire__ 

Under the empire this evolved into a more organized system where the state sent you to a destination of its choosing rather than simply telling you to get out of Italy. The poet Ovid, for example, [withered away in the Black Sea port of Tomis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_of_Ovid) — besides the loss of his home he bitterly regretted the cold and provincial (in all senses) scene of his banishment, which was forced upon him by the emperor Augustus.

There were two forms of statutory exile: _Relegatio_  was a milder punishment, in which the convict retained citizen rights but was excluded from or sent to a particular place on a temporary basis — though “temporary” could mean “until the emperor changes his mind,” which in Ovid’s case never came to pass. The more serious form was _deportatio,_  in which the victim lost all citizen rights and their property was confiscated; in this case the exile was to be permanent.

Islands were noted destinations for exile. For example [Juvenal ](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/juvenal_satires_01.htm)would write _Aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris et carcere dignum si vis esse aliquid. “_ If you want to be somebody, dare some deed worthy of little Gyara or the execution-house” where “Gyara” is a tiny island in the Sporades famous for its poverty. However, we don’t have the kind of information we would need to understand the scale of these kinds of punishments. Since our sources are overwhelmingly concerned with the fortunes of the wealthy and powerful, we can’t be sure if this was a routine part of life for most Romans or the Roman equivalent of “club Fed” for the well connected. Tradition claims that [the author of the Book of Revelation was exiled to Patmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Patmos); if that’s correct this form of punishment extended fairly far down the social scale at least occasionally.

The closest approach to a routinized ‘penal colony’ in our sources is probably be the island of [Pandateria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventotene), which was where the Julio-Claudian dynasty tended to stash unruly or embarrassing relatives. Augustus’ daughter [Julia, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_the_Elder)his granddaugher [Agrippina, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippina_the_Elder)Germanicus’ daugher [Julia Livilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Livilla) and Claudius’ daughter [Claudia Octavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Octavia) all ended up there. However a handful of royals over a few decades does not really amount to a colony, and we know that Pandateria was chosen in large part because it was almost completely uninhabited.

__TLDR__ : the Romans used enforced exile to specified places as a form of punishment. We don’t however know how common or widespread this punishment really was, but there’s no evidence to suggest that the practice was as widespread and systematic as the 19th century variety.
