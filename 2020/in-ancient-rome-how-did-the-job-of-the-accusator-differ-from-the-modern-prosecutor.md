The main way it differs is that it’s ___not___ __a job__ .

The Roman state did not maintain a dedicated police force or a permanent prosecutors office.* There were some magistrates who had investigative functions for very specific sorts of crimes: the [aediles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedile#Powers_of_the_office), for example, were responsible for “public order” issues, such as gambling, prostitution or the the practice of foreign religions (which — contrary to the persistent modern myth — were aggressively surveilled and often outlawed). However most of their authority was executive, not judicial.

A Roman trial was almost always initiated by a private person. Even the most serious crimes, up to and including murders, were prosecuted by private parties, not the state. This was less chaotic than it sounds: In a vertically oriented society like Rome, few people were not part part of a social network centered on some relatively wealthy individual whose prestige and social standing depended on his reputation for protecting “his people,” so poorer victims would typically appeal to their patrons to prosecute a crime on their behalf. The state’s role was to ensure the peaceful resolution of disputes between the interest group represented by the _accusator_ and the interest group represented by the defendant — not to apprehend and punish malefactors on society’s behalf.

The actual trial was much less formal than a modern one: although there were statutes and over time the Romans developed a sophisticated set of recognized precedents and rules, at its root a trial was fundamentally a showdown between two public speakers who hoped to convince a jury by the strength of their oratory to see things their ways. The juries were large — often hundreds and sometimes thousands of jurors — and the atmosphere was much closer to a spirited debate than a sober technical process. Some trials were actually conducted in the political assemblies rather than in the courts proper.

Because the process depended heavily on public speaking skills, professional orators were in high demand as advocates. Both sides in a case frequently hired professional counsel, but their was no real Roman equivalent of a “legal profession” until the imperial period when administrative law became a very technical profession. Under the Republic, a good voice and ready command of Latin were the only requirements for an advocate. There was a class of recognized _jurisconsults —_ men who had a good familiarity with the technicalities of the law and precedent — but the stars of the courtroom were the great public speakers and it was oratory, not the minutiae of the law, which ruled the day.

An _accusator_  was simply the prosecuting speaker in a Roman case — he might be an aggrieved party bringing suit on his own behalf, or an upper-class patron representing the interests of his client, or a hired professional working for pay. He might be an ambitious politician looking to make a name for himself: for example Cicero’s prosecution of the corrupt governor [Gaius Verres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Verrem) was in part a favor to friends in Sicily and in part an star-turn on the political stage as Roman politics emerged from the shadow of Sulla’s dictatorship.

In this system, of course, there were many opportunities for malicious or frivolous prosecutions. The only real check on this was the rule of [calumnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calumnia_(Roman_law)) — if a prosecution failed, the defendant could counter-sue his accuser for “calumny,” which rendered the original _accusator_ liable for the same penalty the first defendant would have suffered.

Frequently today’s _accusator_ would be tomorrow’s defense counsel (Cicero himself was most often a defense attorney, his first famous victory was a politically daring defense of a victim of Sulla’s proscriptions). There was no formal or practical distinction. Many of Cicero’s courtroom speeches involve asides to the _accusator_  on the other side, acknowledging past collaborations or social relations as a way of setting up his take on the case.

Pretty good reference on the Roman system [here](https://oxfordre.com/classics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-8153#:~:text=Over%20time%20the%20Romans%20used,or%20less%20recognizably%20criminal%20today.)



*This answer focuses on the Republican and early imperial periods. The Roman state became much more “professionalized” after the third century and did eventually develop into something more similar to modern systems.
