I suspect it's very specific to different businesses: if you want to meet motivated technologists, it might be at a [Hackathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon), but if you want to meet financially secure investor types in might be one of those [angel investor](http://www.allianceofangels.com/) groups. In other industries there are usually trad groups, user groups, and special interest meetups that cater to networking or information exchange. 

You'll also want to develop good observation skills. Many of these kinds of groups are dominated by people who are interested in networking, rather than by the kind of people you want to network _with._ Just because someone's at the local investors club meetup doesn't mean s/he's succesful. Learn to spot the flakes :)
