The ancient Greek terminology was to call the planets "the star of so-and-so", so our Mars was Ἄρεως ἀστἡρ, "Ares' star" and so on. The identifications -- except for Neptune, Uranus and Pluto, which they didn't know about (hat tip, [Enna Đorđević](https://www.quora.com/profile/Enna-Đorđević)) -- and _all of which are planets, Godsdammit! --_ are all traditional. Planet just means 'wandering' -- πλάνης ἀστήρ is a "wandering star." Before telescopes, the idea that they were solid bodies reflecting light was only rarely entertained -- most people assumed planets were just the moving stars.

There's some question as to whether or not the association of planetary bodies to particular Greek deities is purely Hellenic or whether it borrows from Near Eastern (particularly Babylonian) sources since there are several correspondences; thus:

Venus = Aphrodite = [Ishtar](http://Ishtar) in both theology and astronomy

Mars = Ares = [Nergal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nergal),

Jupiter = Zeus = [Marduk](http://Marduk)

Mercury = Hermes = [Nabu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabu)

So its likely that Greek star-studies did not evolve independently but rather started with the far more developed traditions of the Babylonians (maybe transmitted via Phoenicia or Crete) In Hellenistic times Babylonian astrology and astronomy were very influential throughout the Greek and Roman world -- that's why modern horoscopes and constellations are [mostly Babylonian](http://mostly Babylonian).

We don't know much about how this evolved in the pre-Classical period but my bet would be that the Mesopotamian traditions were widely spread (probably in a garbled form) long before Alexander.
