There wasn’t really a fixed term limit — the office was really designed to last for the the duration of an emergency. For example the first dictatorship of [Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Quinctius_Cincinnatus#First_dictatorship) lasted only 15 days — long enough to rescue a besieged Roman army from the Aequi. His second dictatorship, to deal with the machinations of a would-be demagogue, lasted 21 days. A war, civil strife, or anything like a plague or an earthquake that strongly hinted at divine displeasure could be enough to appoint a dictator; the appointment was understood to be tied to a particular crisis.

The six-month time limit was intended as a failsafe to prevent a dictator from assuming royal power permanently. The expectation, bolstered by the consensus of the Senate (which included all current and former magistrates, and thus all of the people responsible for carrying out the dictator’s orders) was that the dictator would lay down his office when the crisis was past. However, the real enforcement mechanism was the collective self-interest the aristocratic class, which had the most to lose if a new monarch ever took power .

So, when the upper classes felt that a dictator was less of a threat than popular unrest the six-month limit was not enforced. In 390 BC, when [Marcus Furius Camillus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Furius_Camillus) was made dictator to drive out the Gauls who captured Rome, the Senate kept him in power for nearly a year because they wanted to leverage his prestige (and his known reactionary principles) to prevent the plebeians from abandoning the burnt-out city and resettling in Veii. As often in politics, the rules mattered less than the players-

Caesar’s dictatorship (like [Sulla’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla) before it) is not really a linear continuation of the traditional dictatorship. The office of dictator had fallen out of use for over a century before Sulla revived it in 82 BC. The last wartime dictator was [Marcus Junius Pera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Pera), appointed in the wake of the disaster at Cannae in 216. He served at the same time as the only-ever “second” dictator, [Marcus Fabius Buteo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Fabius_Buteo), who handled the appointment of new Senators to replace those lost in the battle. Towards the end of the Second Punic war there were several _dictatores_  _comitiorum habendorum causa,_ who only served to initiate the electoral process of the comitia while the serving consuls were out of the city. However nobody again held sole power in Rome between 202 and Sulla’s march on Rome.

__Sulla__ 

Legally neither Sulla’s dictatorship nor Caesar’s fit the traditional form, which had to be initiated by the Senate and nominated by a sitting consul.

Having already taken the city at swordpoint (and having killed the last consul) Sulla concocted his own “appointment” at the hands of an _[interrex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrex)_ _—_ another long-obsolete office which had never before had the power to appoint a dictator. The interrex convened an assembly to allow the citizens to vote — under the watchful eyes of Sulla’s army — for the dictator, another innovation. As [Appian](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0232%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D11) put it:

> There had been autocratic rule of the dictators before, but it was limited to short periods. But in Sulla's time it first became unlimited and so an absolute tyranny; yet they added, for propriety's sake, that they chose him dictator for the enactment of such laws as he might deem best and for the regulation of the commonwealth. Thus the Romans, after having government by kings for sixty Olympiads, and a democracy, under consuls chosen yearly, for 100 Olympiads, resorted to kingly government again.

Sulla’s dictatorship dispensed with the formal time limit, but at least it was formally tied to the “restoration” of the laws that Sulla cited as his pretext. He did, in fact, resign his dictatorship after bit more than a year, and lived out his life as, nominally, a private citizen.

__Caesar__ 

Caesar, who narrowly escaped with his life from Sulla’s tyranny as a young man, was actually dictator [several times](http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/datesjc.html)_—_ though none was distinguished for legal niceties. The first time was in 49, right after the Pompeian forces in had evacuated Italy and Caesar commanded the only army in Italy; here’s [Appian again](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0232%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D7):

> Cæsar proceeded to Rome, where the trembling people chose him dictator without any decree of the Senate and without the intervention of a magistrate. But he, either deprecating the office as likely to prove invidious or not desiring it, after holding it only eleven days (as some say) designated himself and Publius Isauricus as consuls.

He was dictator again — without even returning to Italy — in 48. At the same time he was granted the powers of a tribune without actually holding the office and despite being a patrician. In 47 he was dictator yet again, and in 46 he was given the office for a nominal 10 year term. By this point, however, the legal language was more or less meaningless. After his final victory in the war he broke with tradition by celebrating a triumph for his victory over his fellow Romans, being named consul for ten years, and having his tribunician powers were confirmed for life. Caesar, however, had clearly dispensed with any lingering reverence for the law; [Suetonius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#77) (not an admirer of Caesar, on the whole) records Caesar as saying _Sullam nescisse litteras, qui dictaturam deposuerit:_ “Sulla didn’t know his letters [ie. was a fool] when he laid down his dictatorship.”

In February of 44 Caesar’s friends made a public show of offering him a crown at the [Lupercalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupercalia), but the hostile response of the crowds convinced him to decline the crown — though his real feelings were betrayed by the fact that he summarily (and illegally) dismissed the tribunes of the people who tore down the crowns which had been placed on Caesar’s statues. Since at that point the title of “king” was too unpopular, Caesar had himself named _dictator perpetuo_ , “dictator for life” — dispensing with any idea of a temporary office. He also gave himself the power to appoint the consuls, underlining the point that the state was his to do with as he wished.

However his “lifetime” office only lasted a month.

_You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?_ 

_Er…_ ___yes___ _, actually._
