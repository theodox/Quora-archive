It is the [Game Developers Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/).

It’s the annual expo for game developers — the place where people who make games get together to share expertise, debate the state of the industry, and of course to look for jobs and make deals.

The unique aspect of GDC is that it is intended for people who make games. There are other game-related shows: [PAX](http://www.paxsite.com/) and [gamescom](http://www.gamescom-cologne.com/gamescom/index-9.php) focus on showing games to gamers; [E3](https://www.e3expo.com/) connects game studios with publishers and the press. But GDC is where people who work in games get to talk to their peers, to learn new techniques, and to connect with businesses that support game devs (for example, the folks who sell motion capture equipment, game engines, or 3D modeling software).

You can get a great idea of the range of topics and content at the show by checking out the [GDC youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/gdconf).
