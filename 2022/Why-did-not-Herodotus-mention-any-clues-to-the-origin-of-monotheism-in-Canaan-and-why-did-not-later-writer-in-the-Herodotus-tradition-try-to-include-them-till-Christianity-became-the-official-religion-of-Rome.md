The oldest outside mention of Jewish monotheism goes back to [Hecataeus of Abdera,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecataeus_of_Abdera) a Greek writer contemporary with Ptolemy I who wrote this regarding Moses, probably around 290 BC:

> The leader of this colony was one Moses, a very wise and valiant man, who, after he had possessed himself of the country, amongst other cities, built that now most famous city, Jerusalem, and the temple there, which is so greatly revered among them. He instituted the holy rites and ceremonies with which they worship God; and made laws for the methodical government of the state. He also divided the people into twelve tribes, which he regarded as the most perfect number; because it corresponds to the twelve months within a whole year. __He made no representation or image of gods, because he considered that nothing of a human shape was applicable to God; but that heaven, which surrounds the earth, was the only God, and that all things were in its power.__ 

(as quoted in [Diodorus Siculus, 40.3](http://attalus.org/translate/diodorus40.html))

Not only does this predate the conversion of Constantine, Diodorus was quoting Hecataeus before 30 BC — when the original over 250 years old.

There’s a longer variation on the same theme in [Strabo, 16.2.35](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16B*.html) , written sometime during the reign of Tiberius:

> Moses, namely, was one of the Aegyptian priests, and held a part of Lower Aegypt, as it is called, but he went away from there to Judaea, since he was displeased with the state of affairs there, and was accompanied by many people who worshipped the Divine Being. For he says, and taught, that the Aegyptians were mistaken in representing the Divine Being by the images of beasts and cattle,​ as were also the Libyans; and that the Greeks were also wrong in modelling gods in human form; __for, according to him, God is this one thing alone that encompasses us all and encompasses land and sea — the thing which we call heaven, or universe, or the nature of all that exists.__ What man, then, if he has sense, could be bold enough to fabricate an image of God resembling any creature amongst us? Nay, people should leave off all image-carving, and, setting apart a sacred precinct and a worthy sanctuary, should worship God without an image



For the record, Herodotus’s reference to Hebrews, Jews, Canaanites — whatever you want to call them — is just an aside in the context of another topic ([2.104](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/2b*.html))

> …. the Colchians and Egyptians and Ethiopians are the only nations that have from the first practised circumcision. The Phoenicians and the Syrians of Palestine acknowledge of themselves that they learnt the custom from the Egyptians

The depth of his knowledge here can be judged by the fact that he refers to them as “Syrians,” which in contemporary usage would mean “Aramaic speakers” — he, at least, wasn’t able to tell them apart from their neighbors who spoke a different language. His one concrete reference to a “Palestinian” landmark is to an Egyptian relief (still visible today) in Nahr al Kalb, which is north of Beirut.
