If it really is true that the [Phoenicians circumnavigated Africa](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/herodotus/herodotus-on-the-first-circumnavigation-of-africa/) in about 605 BC, they will have observed something like it. According to Herodotus -- who tells the story but does not seem to believe it himself -- they set off from the Red Sea and sailed south then west , returning via the straits of Gibraltar after a three year voyage. Since part of the delay was stopping to plant and harvest crops (Phoenician ships were way too small to sustain a three year voyage!) they will have experienced "winter" in both hemispheres, including in the temperate areas around the cape of Good Hope . 

The best reason to believe the story is exactly the one which Herodotus gives for doubting it -- that while sailing west around the cape they had the sun on their _right_  -- which he dismisses as impossible but is of course just what should happen in the Southern Hemisphere. 

Unfortunately that is the only record of the voyage so we can't really be sure what they noticed or didn't. And of course plenty of people will have crossed the equator, though voyages long enough to show seasonal variation will be fairly rare until the 15th century.
