As the other answers point out, _official_ harems and eunuch attendants were rare in the West, though unofficial concubinage was very common. It's up to you if you want to count the Ottoman empire as "West", but it was the main way Europeans heard about harems, and by the 17th and 18th centuries it's a kind of metaphorical shorthand for the differences between "East" and "West" in fiction and [the arts](http://www.tokyojinja.com/tag/lawrence-alma-tadema/), particularly in opera's like Mozart's [Abduction from the Seraglio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Entf%C3%BChrung_aus_dem_Serail). The main difference between Europe on the one hand and China, India and the Islamic world on the other is that there was no native European tradition of plural marriage, so there was no officially acceptable way for the powerful to flaunt their concubines. 

Byzantium, on the border between "East" and "West," definitely inherited the tradition of using eunuchs as court officials -- a practice going back to late Roman times, particularly in the eastern provinces of the empire, and shared with the Parthians and before them the Persians. One justification for castrating eunuchs was to make render them incapable of, er, interfering with royal bloodlines; but the other was to remove them from any dynastic ambitions on their own: many ancient societies had to fight hard against the tendency of families to try to co-opt the institutions of the state by turning state offices into hereditary possessions. Eunuchs were considered reliable because they could have no heirs of their own (although there are many cases of powerful eunuchs intriguing on behalf of their extended families). A powerful eunuch in Byzantium could be a general, like [Narses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narses) or even the effective ruler of the Empire, like [Nikephoritzes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikephoritzes).

Further west, there was very little "official" use of castration -- in part because the tradition hadn't existed farther west in Roman times and in part because the western clergy, being celibate, fulfilled some of the same functions (Byzantine Orthodox clergy could marry). In the 15th or 16th century the practice became popular in [opera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castrato) as a way of preserving the high voices of young boys, as luridly chronicled by [Anne Rice](http://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/10/books/luxury-sex-and-music.html).
