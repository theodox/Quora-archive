A tribune can forbid any action by a magistrate: this is the power known as the veto. You can’t make people do things, but you you can simply prevent people from doing anything: no making of laws, no elections, no callup of the toops, etc. Since a Roman law can only be passed by the people you can simply forbid the law from being presented to a vote of the assembly.

You can propose laws directly to the people, ie, to the assembly. The Senate can’t stop you, although the voting is weighted towards the wealthy so it’s still hard to pass legislation on behalf of the poorer classes without their support.

Your other power is that you are literally _untouchable_ : it’s against the law for anyone to lay hands on a tribune. So you could prevent the Senate from meeting by simply standing in the doorway of the Senate house: nobody can push past you.

The thing to watch out for is the other tribunes. If you all agree on a policy the veto is very hard to beat: you can basically tie up the regular business of the city for your whole term if they don’t come to a deal. On the other hand you can’t get much positive action to happen without their cooperation. It’s a good hand for negotiating, but if the Senators can get a tribune to side with them the vetos can cancel each other out. So you need a united front.

_Bona fortuna!_
