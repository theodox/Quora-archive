Strictly speaking there were:

_Trajan, ca. 115, as Pharaoh on a relief at_ _[Esna](http://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/esnatemple.html)_ _._ 

This is Roman emperor [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan), smiting his Parthian enemies in true Pharaonic style — you’ll notice he’s using a mace and a pose which would have been appropriate to Narmer, the first Pharaoh, nearly three thousand years before:

Trajan ruled Egypt almost a century and a half after Cleopatra. For about three hundred and fifty years after Cleopatra the Roman emperors reigned — in theory, anyway — as pharaohs. They continued the same public show of respect for Egyptian tradition that the Ptolemies had put on during their own reign.

Of course, this was all a polite fiction: despite the artworks on the temple walls they treated Egypt primarily as a particularly profitable business venture, a source of grain and exotic trade goods. It was still ultimately a province, even if it was a wealthy and jealously guarded one.

It was also far away.

Unlike the Ptolemies and the various other foreign and native dynasties which had preceded them over the previous three millennia, the emperors were rarely physically present. The pharaoh’s role as living embodiment of the cosmic order was far harder to maintain when the [Son of Ra and Lord of the Two Crowns](https://www.livescience.com/44350-carving-shows-roman-emperor-dressed-as-egyptian-pharaoh.html) did not set foot in Egypt more than once or twice a generation. A foreign pharaoh, willing to play along, can still form the public focus of ritual and belief. But an entirely absent sovereign, who appears only as an image on a coin or a name in the annual loyalty oath, has little to offer as a spiritual totem even if he’s willing (as the Roman emperors generally were) to keep building traditional temples and maintaining the priestly hierarchy.

The fiction that the Roman emperor was just another pharaoh hung on, gradually thinning out, until the [50 years of civil wars which convulsed the Roman world in the third century](https://www.ancient.eu/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century/); by the time order was restored, old illusions of many kinds had been dispensed with. Diocletian, the eventual winner, dismantled most of what was left of Egypt’s distinctive style of government as part of his ruthless centralization of the Roman world. He still sponsored some Egyptianate propaganda art, but his reign is marked the real end of the illusion.

_Diocletian, right. Note the low quality of the carving and inscriptions: this is a much less lavish display than previous Roman-Egyptian art.

The[ last name ever to appear in a pharaoh’s cartouche](https://pharaoh.se/roman-emperors) is that of [Maximinus Daia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximinus_II) (reigned 311–313, 8 years after Diocletian). He’s the real last Pharaoh.
