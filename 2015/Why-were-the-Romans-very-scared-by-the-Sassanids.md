For much of the period when Rome and the Sassanids co-existed, the Sassanids were the most advanced and richest adversary that the Romans had to deal with. They were important foes and worthy of caution.

On their home territory, and in areas where their mobile style of warfare was naturally superior, they were formidable enemies. Plus, their language and customs reminded the Romans of the Parthians, who were one of the few neighboring powers that the Romans never subdued. Finally, the Sassanids bordered the wealthy, strategic Roman territories in Syria. The success of [Khosrau II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosrau_IIin) in the [Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_War_of_602%E2%80%93628) was Roman's worst nightmare: the Empire cut in two and the wealthy provinces of the East under foreign control. 

The success of [Heraclius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclius) in driving the Persians back was very hard won, and both empires were completely exhausted by the struggle -- which shows how evenly matched they were, as well as setting the stage for the spread of the first Muslim empire.
