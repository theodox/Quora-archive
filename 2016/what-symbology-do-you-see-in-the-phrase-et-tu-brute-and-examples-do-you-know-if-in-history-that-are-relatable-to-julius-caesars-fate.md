It’s not certain that Caesar actually said _et tu, Brute._ The direct quote is actually in Greek, καὶ σὺ, τέκνον which would translate literally as “and you, boy?” which is often cited as evidence that Caesar believed Brutus was his son - a rumor that has been floating around for the last 2,000 yeas. The familiar _et tu, Brute?_  (literally _“you too, Brutus?”_ is a Renaissance era translation into Latin, made famous by Shakespeare.*

Caesar wasn’t completely surprised to be the target of an assassination — he was, after all, a dictator in both the ancient and modern senses, the recent victor of a bloody civil war who had sent dozens of his political opponents — and tens of thousands of ordinary footsoldiers — to their deaths.

However we was surprised to see [Brutus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus_the_Younger)among the assassins. Brutus had been personally close to Caesar since boyhood: Brutus’ mother [Servilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servilia_(mother_of_Brutus)) was Caesar’s mistress for many years and it was rumored even at the time that Brutus was in fact Caesar’s son.

Child or not, Caesar had done his best to be good to Brutus. During the civil war Brutus fought on the Republican side, but Caesar took great pains to make sure that he was not killed. Having captured him, Caesar not only pardoned Brutus but appointed him governor of Cisalpine Gaul — while the war was still going on in Africa! — trusting to Brutus’ public reputation for honesty and incorruptibility. The appointment seems to have been a success for both men.

It was widely believed at the time that Caesar was grooming Brutus as a possible successor — somebody actually told Caesar that Brutus was plotting against him and Caesar replied “what, he can’t wait out this poor old body?”

That’s why the phrase has lasted: it’s poignant. _et tu, Brute_  is an expression of deep personal disappointment in the context of politics - a reminder of the human passions and interpersonal calculations that underly the rhetoric and abstractions we tell ourselves drive our political behavior.

* Some people read this as “you too, boy!” meaning that Caesar was predicting a violent end for Brutus — but there’s no way to be sure.
