For a number of reasons, Caesar’s career falls into the three or four best documented decades in all of Roman history.

Besides detailed histories (by Caesar himself, by [Sallust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallust), and by [Cassius Dio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassius_Dio)) there are and biographies of several of the major actors by [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch) and [Suetonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suetonius)). Perhaps most important sources are the speeches and letters of [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero), who is probably the single best known individual personality in Western history before the Renaissance: you get to see him in both official and unofficial ways as both an participant and a spectator in the convulsions which marked the death of the Republic and the birth of the Empire.

Because this time is so well documented (there are big swathes of Roman history which exist only as a few paragraphs of summary in later textbooks) the field seems incredibly crowded. Here are some of the big names. If it sounds like a Hollywood potboiler… well, it was one. Fans of the period will know I’m leaving out many interesting ones.

[Pompey The Great ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey)before Caesar, Pompey was the first man in Rome; a powerful general who held more individual power than any Roman before, he assisted Caesar’s rise (and married Caesar’s daughter) — but in the end he turned on Caesar and died after losing to him in the civil war.

[Crassus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Licinius_Crassus), the richest man in Rome. He, Caesar and Pompey combined forces and for over a decade they ran Rome almost as a private fiefdom. However his desperate sense of inferiority — his only military victory was over the slave army of [Spartacus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacus)— sent him on a doomed expedition against the Parthians. According to legend he ended his days being forced to drink molten gold. His death broke the alliance between Pompey and Caesar, setting the Republic on the course to destruction.

[Mark Antony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Antony), one of Caesar’s main henchmen, who tried to pick up where Caesar left off and assume sole power — and Cleopatra’s affections.

[Octavian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus), “the boy assassin”. Caesar’s great nephew and adoptive heir, after Caesar’s death he became, at only 19, a warlord in the struggle for Caesar’s legacy. By the time he was 32 he has become the sole ruler of Rome, and entered history as Augustus, the first emperor. He grew from the bloody victor of a vicious civil war to a beloved elder statesman.

[Cleopatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra) - the last queen of independent Egypt. A cultured, independent woman in a weak, fragile country; she became Caesar’s lover and bore his only child. After his death she became Antony’s lover and political mastermind.

[Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero), the orator - a provincial nobody who became consul entirely on the strength of his words. Also, a diva and something of a coward. Nevertheless he came out of retirement after Caesar’s death to try to save the Republic; but he was murdered by Octavian and Antony.

[Clodius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Clodius_Pulcher), a renegade aristocrat who led a violent street gang that dominated Rome’s back alleys. After he was murdered in a street brawl his wife [Fulvia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulvia)married Antory. She was a populist firebrand who raised her own armies to fight Octavian while Antony was away in Egypt.

[Cato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Younger), the most reactionary - but most principled and charismatic - of the aristocrats who opposed Caesar; a die-hard Republican who fought Caesar at every step, politically and then militarily. He killed himself rather than surrender to Caesar.

[Servilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servilia_(mother_of_Brutus)) the only Roman woman Caesar ever loved, his mistress of several decades.. She was related by blood or marriage to most of the major players in the era.

and of course

[Brutus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus_the_Younger), of _Et tu, Brute?_ Servilia’s son — and possibly Caesar’s. He was famous as the fairest and most upright man of his generation (Caesar trusted him so much that he made him a provincial governor _after_  capturing him on the battlefield at Pharsalus). He was also a distant descendant of the Lucius Brutus who killed Rome’s last king and founded the Republic - a legacy which came to haunt him.
