The Greeks and Romans generally started education outside the home at around age 7. Before that there was informal education at home, which might or might not have included education in literacy depending on the family.

Literacy rates varied pretty widely in the ancient world: cities were more literate than the countryside, the wealthy moreso than the poor, and many of the dfferent cultures of antiquity never developed literacy in their own tongues: if a Celtic or Thracian or Libyan child learned to read and write it would have almost certainly been in Latin or Greek and not their native tongue.

After about age 7 students would usually be sent to a each for formal study. This was usually a private arrangement but some cities would pay for teachers; there was nothing like a ‘department of education’, but some cities would hire one more teachers to educate the children of citizens. In Greece the primary venue for these classes was the [Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(ancient_Greece)) — which meant that any education given to girls would be arranged privately, since the gymnasia were male-only. [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Sparta) seems to have been the only Greek city which provided public education for girls.

In Rome education was almost always private, and the Romans didn’t intertwine physical education with other studies the way the Greeks did: Roman classes would be in rented halls, convenient public places such as temples. Romans tended to be more evenhanded in educating their girls.

The tutors could be free, but were frequently slaves (ancient slavery included a lot of skilled professions as well as manual laborers). Most children would be accompanied to school by a servant — a _paidagogos_ or “boy-leader”, the root of our word “pedagogy” — who made sure they got there safely and did their work.

The actual course of instruction in both cases was quite similar (particularly as many Roman tutors were Greeks, and Roman education tended to imitate the Greek model).

In Rome at least early literacy education was in the hands of the lowest class of tutor, a _litterator,_  who children from 7 to 9 or so the rudiments of reading and writing. Once these were mastered the children moved up to a _grammaticus,_ who taught composition and poesy . Children started by learning letter forms and alphabetization, and then moved up to syllables and thence to words. Eventually they moved on to short reading samples — school life was a common theme, but simplified versions of familiar scenes from Homer or Virgil would also be used for practice. If a student was still in school past about 13, they probably moved on to study with a _rhetor_ , a rhetorician, who would put more emphasis on public speaking, forensics, and classical poetry.

The actual business of learning to write was, like today, mostly about practice. We have a few examples of excercises — on papyrus from Egypt, scratched on potsherds (_ostraka), or_ scratched in wood. Wax tablets and slates were also used, since they were reusable.

Learning literacy was hard, because both Greek and Latin were WEREUSUALLYWRITTENWITHOUTSPACESORPUNCTUATION; one of the skills a student needed to master was spotting word and sentence beaks. Correctly identifying the speakers in a dialogue without quotation marks was also demanding. Oral poetry was very important in both cultures and so proper scansion and metre became important in later education.

Recitation was an important part of studies: a common theme in the surviving school texts is the need to ‘present’ in front of the class — the verb is _reddo,_ so a child _reddit literas_ “presented his letters.” For flavor, Here’s a bit of [a bilingual Greek-Latin elementary reader ](https://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_post03/Dositheus/dos_col2.html)from around the time of Diocletian (ca. 280) — as you can see, it’s as stilted as a lot of modern school readers:

> _Surge, puer. quid sedes? tolle omnes libros latinos, membranas et pugillares et locellum et praeductal, atramentum et cannas. eamus, salutemus._ 

> _Ave, domine praeceptor, bene tibi sit. ab hodie studere volo. rogo te ergo, <doce me> latine loqui. Doceo te, si me attendas. Ecce, attendo. Bene dixisti, ut decet ingenuitatem tuam._ 

> _Porrige mihi, puer, manuale. cito ergo porrige librum, revolve, lege cum voce, aperi os, computa. modo bene fac locum, ut scribas dictatum._ 

> _Mercedem non attulisti? Petivi patrem et dixit: ego ipse veniam ibi noviter. volo enim et experimentum accipere. Age ergo diligenter, ut paratus sis. Paratus sum. incendi enim lucernam et nocte meditatus sum. Bene fecisti, modo te laudo._ 

> Get up, boy. Why are you sitting? Take all your Latin books, parchments, writing tablets and stylus, ink and pens. Let’s go, let’s greet [the teacher]

> “Hello, mr. teacher, may you be well. Starting today I want to study. Therefore I ask you <teach me> to speak Latin.”

> “I [shall] teach you if you will listen to me.”

> “See, I’m paying attention.”

> “You spoke well, as befits your cleverness”

> “Show me your workbook. Quickly, therefore, produce the book, turn [to the right page], read out loud, open [your] mouth, count it out. Mark the place well, so that you can take dictation.”

> “Didn’t you bring the tuition money?”

> “I asked my father, and he said ‘I myself will come there shortly. I also want to see your progress, so work diligently that you may be ready.”

> “I am ready. I am ready - I lit the lantern and studied at night”

> “You have done well. Now I praise you.”

One really interesting resource for this is [Learning Latin The Ancient Way](http://amzn.to/1st7HRX), by Eleanor Dickey - it’s got a collection of Latin teaching materials from antiquity. Most are really for adult Greek speakers learning Latin but there was a lot of overlap in the methods.
