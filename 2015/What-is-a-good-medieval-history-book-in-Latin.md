Einhard's [Vita Karoli Magni](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/ein.html) (English [Life of Charles the Great](http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/einhard.asp#The)) isn't too bad, although it's not the most lovely Latin.

Gregory of Tours' [Historia Francorum](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/gregorytours/gregorytours1.shtml) ([History of the Franks](http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.asp)) is probably the most important literary source between the fall of the western Empire and Charlemagne.

The [Vita Anskarii](https://archive.org/details/vitaanskariiauc00waitgoog) ([Life of St. Ansgar](http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/anskar.asp)) is a good look at the early movement to convert the northmen.
