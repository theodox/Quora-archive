They did: it just took them a few days to realize that the defenders would not just surrender or run away.

The entire Persian campaign really failed because the Persians refused to believe, until it was too late, that the Greeks were capable of serious resistance. According to the traditional account the Persians actually waited four days expecting the Greeks to simply turn and run, terrified of their vastly superior numbers. This fits well with the psychology of the whole Persian campaign, which was as much psychological as military: the vast — almost pointlessly vast, and certainly unwieldy — army they brought was intended to intimidate the Greeks into confusion and panic.

This concept was not unreasonable — most of northern Greece had already surrendered without a fight, and the Persians had conquered Ionia largely because of double-dealing and vacillation among the Greeks there. However, these experiences taught Xerxes to underestimate his enemies — even though he had the exiled Spartan king, Demaratus, in his camp. Demaratus had tried to explain that this was to be a different battle, but Xerxes didn’t believe him:

> To Xerxes that which was said seemed to be utterly incredible, and he asked again a second time in what manner being so few they would fight with his host. He said; "O king, deal with me as with a liar, if thou find not that these things come to pass as I say."

Herodotus, 7.209

So,

> on the fifth day, when [the Greeks] did not depart but remained — being obstinate in impudence and folly, or so he thought — [Xerxes] was enraged and sent against them the Medes and the Cissians, charging them to take the men alive and bring them into his presence.

This confidence was misplaced, and the actual fighting proved to be a serious challenge.

The Persian army was poorly armed for this kind of fight where the Greeks’ heavier armor and close-order tactics gave them a huge advantage. The vastly superior Persian cavalry wasn’t much use in the close confines of the field, and the narrow approaches negated much of their numerical advantages. The outlines of this dynamic were already apparent at the battle of [Marathon,](http://www.livius.org/articles/battle/marathon-490-bce/) a decade earlier, but the lesson had not really been learnt. Thermopylae was where the Persians first learned that they could not easily defeat well-led Greek hoplites. The first effort to “capture” the Greeks, and a second day of more serious but equally unsuccessful assaults, ended in failure.

In the long run, [Persian numbers would probably have won out](https://www.quora.com/If-the-Persians-didnt-find-out-about-the-goat-path-could-the-Spartans-have-won-the-Battle-of-Thermopylae). But it was not really necessary to wait — as Xerxes had expected, Greek disunity did prove decisive — in the form of a Greek willing to lead the Persians around by a flanking mountain path that turned the position:

> Ephialtes the son of Eurydemos, a Malian, came to speak with him, supposing that he would win a very great reward from the king; and this man told him of the path which leads over the mountain to Thermopylae, and brought about the destruction of those Greeks who remained in that place.

As far as alternate invasion routes — there were not a lot of land options. Thermopylae has always been a key defensive position for the south of Greece — beside the battle in 480 BC there were significant fights there in 353, 279, and 191 BC, then in 267, 997, 1821, and 1941 of our era. Any alternate route that headed inland would have been a terrible logistical problem for the Persians; they would be entirely dependent on the food and water of the Greek cities which were significantly smaller than the vast Persian army. Along the coast, however, they could be supplied by the large Persian fleet.

However, if the battle at Thermopylae had been stalled much longer, the Persians would probably have landed troops behind the Greek lines. The Greek and Persian fleets faced off at[ Artemision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Artemisium) at the same time as the land armies were clashing at Thermopylae, but the Persians outnumbered the Greek fleet by about 4:1 and the Greeks could not afford to trade them ship for ship.

Alternatively, the Persians could have ferried troops to the island of Euboea. which would have let them march down to the Euripos strait at the city of Chalcis— a point where the island is only about 50 meters from the mainland. The Persian engineers, who had already bridged the much wider strait between Europe and Asia Minor at the start of the campaign, were certainly capable of bridging that gap (the Greeks themselves bridged it during the Peloponnessian War, 70 years after Thermopylae).
