It's very haphazard, unfortunately: you'll effectively be put on a wait list and will find out very late in the summer which school you'll be attending in the fall. They fill empty slots on a first-come basis once the reference school kids are placed (some of these are, of course, going to different schools themselves). Alas, its' not a parent-friendly system. They really prefer to keep you in your reference school. 

FWIW There's also no guarantee that subsequent kids will end up in the same school: officially, at least, the school system does not recognize keep siblings together as a reason to bump your priority on the waiting list. Informally I think schools do some behind the scenes magic to keep siblings together when they can: the system is already somewhat unpopular and enough parents trying to send two elementary kids to two different schools each morning would cause a revolt.
