# What works of fiction set during Ancient Egypt are not set during the New Kingdom or the Hellenistic periods? I feel like those two periods dominate the setting.

[Imhotep](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003K16Q3G?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_0&storeType=ebooks) by Jerry Dubs is set in the 3d Dynasty (with a thin time-travel-ish wrapper around it).

[River God](https://amzn.to/31aWoTa) by Wilbur Smith and its successors are supposed to start in 1780 BC (though they feature the Hyksos as antagonists, who ought not to arrive for another century or so).

I just noticed that Naguib Mahfouz — who’s celebrated for this 20th century Egyptian settings — also did some historical novels that are now translated into English: [Khufu's Wisdom, Rhadopis of Nubia, and Thebes at War](https://amzn.to/3esaJyc). The first two will be Old Kingdom, the last looks like its at the end of the Second Intermediate Period. It’s cool to see an Ancient Egypt book by an actual Egyptian.
