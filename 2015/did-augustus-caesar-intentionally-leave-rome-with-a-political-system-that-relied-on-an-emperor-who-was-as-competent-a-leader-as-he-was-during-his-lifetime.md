# Did Augustus Caesar intentionally leave Rome with a political system that relied on an emperor who was as competent a leader as he was during his lifetime?

We don't have a lot of direct evidence for Augustus' intentions. The best first hand source would be the [Res Gestae Divi Augusti](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/home.html) , which was basically his public testament and effort to ensure his legacy -- unfortunately it only gives hints at what he really thought.

Indirectly, we know that Augustus did what he could to put an end to the cycle of violent political and military competition which had been ruining the Republic since at least the time of Marius. More than anything else he tried to cut potential rivals off from long periods of high military command and to ensure the loyalty of the troops to the state (or at least, to the dynasty) instead of to their generals: here's a soldiers' oath:



> I swear to Zeus, Earth, Sun, all the gods and goddesses, and to [Augustus](https://romanvoices.wikispaces.com/Augustus) himself, that I will be loyal to [Caesar Augustus](https://romanvoices.wikispaces.com/Augustus), his children, and descendants all through my life, both in word, deed, and thought, holding as friends those they hold as friends and considering those as enemies whom they judge to be such, that with regard to things that concern them I will not be sparing of my body or my soul or my life or children, but will face every peril with respect to things that affect them. If there is anything that I should recognize or hear as spoken, plotted, or done contrary to this, I will report this and be an enemy of the person speaking, plotting, or doing any of these things. Whomever they judge to be enemies, I will pursue and defend against them by land and sea with arms and steel.




He also made sure that the emperor's private resources (particularly, direct control over the immense wealth of Egypt and the huge collection of client states he inherited from Caesar) outweighed those of the Roman state. 

Again, this was a key safeguard against civil war, but it was (again) also a way of safeguarding the interests of his dynasty: its' hard to decide between the two motives.

If I had to guess, I'd say that Augustus' primary motivation was to ensure that his dynasty was unchallenged. The balance of altruism -- no more civil wars -- and dynastic ambition being very fluid, probably even to himself. One thing that's clear is that he did want to leave a dynasty: his chosen successors were all family members. Family could be a somewhat elastic term (he himself was Caesar's heir by adoption) but it was not a formal institution: He did not provide a mechanism for selecting possible successors, either in the form of a law or a process for election. It's not entirely surprising, given the way the Republic managed to undermine all of its own forms in the last generation, but quite clearly did pave the way for both the dynastic chaos of his own family and the series of military dictatorships that followed in the next century, since there was no institution dedicated to guaranteeing the fitness of a prospective emperor and no larger legitimizing principle than success and the applause of a (cowed or bribed) Senate and People.

One thing we tend to forget is that monarchies aren't just about one-person rule: they are often institutions evolved to limit and shape the powers of a single ruler as much as to enshrine it. It took a long time for Rome to evolve authentic constraints of monarchical power (they may have learned some of the wrong lessons from the Hellenistic monarchies, which were equally unstable and unconstrained). Many medieval kings were far more limited in their actual powers than an Augustus or a Ptolemy, enmeshed in a complex web of personal education, religious values, feudal obligations and customary limits which Roman emperors regularly flouted (at least until the middle Byzantine era). It takes a long time to learn how to tame tyrants.
