It only works that way if you also want to believe that Blacks can't act in Shakespeare plays, Asians can't play classical music, and gay actors can't play straight parts. 

In other words, it's a silly idea. 

It's made extra silly by fact that Egyptians don't fit neatly into the silly old 'black/white' racial model anyway: ancient Egyptians looked a lot like modern Egyptians (and not like people from either Nigeria or a Hollywood movie). So by the "logic" of this question black Africans -- at least, those from anywhere south or west of Sudan -- should also be "forbidden."
