The mausoleum never fell entirely out of use: it is, after all, in the middle of Rome. It had several different careers. And all that use means that the earthly remains of the Julio-Claudian imperial family are long since scattered to the winds. There’s a reason Martial memorialized it like this:

> Pour me a double measure, of Falernian, Callistus,
and you Alcimus, melt over it summer snows,
let my sleek hair be soaked with excess of perfume,
my brow be wearied beneath the sewn-on rose.
The Mausoleum tells us to live, that one nearby,
it teaches us that the gods themselves can die.

The structure was a medieval fortress for the [Colonna](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Colonna-family) (it might have been militarized earlier — the [Castel St. Angelo](https://www.througheternity.com/en/blog/history/the-mysteries-of-castel-santangelo.html), another imperial mausoleum was converted into a fortress in the early 5th century). The medieval fortifications were dismantled in 1241 after one of their frequent wars with their Roman neighbors; this deconstruction is one of the primary reasons the structure today is in such bad shape.

The Mausoleum was a picturesque garden retreat for the Soderini family during the Renaissance — it was even converted into a bull ring on occasion, and remained a kind of open-air recreation area until the end of the 19th century:

In 1870 the main structure was roofed and converted into a music hall, and it continued in use as a concert venue into the 1930’s.

The “ruinous” appearance of the mausoleum only dates from the late 30’s — Mussolini, ever the architectural magpie, planned to rebuild the area around the Mausoleum and the Ara Pacis as a grand monument to the renewed glory of Rome (and probably, as a tomb for himself). New Fascist buildings were erected as a part of the scene-setting and the concert hall was dismantled.

Events intervened, of course, and the reconstruction was never done. [Given Mussolini’s track record as a conservator of antiquities ](https://www.quora.com/Was-Mussolini-ironically-an-excellent-promoter-protector-and-steward-of-ancient-Roman-ruins-and-archeology/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=6d5f90d6&srid=zLvM)that’s all for the the good.

The actual fate of the human remains within is not known. An old tradition says the urns and ashes within were destroyed during the Vandal sack of 410, but there’s no first-hand evidence that this was the case. Substantially the same story is told about Hadrian’s remains in the [Castel St. Angelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_Sant%27Angelo#Hadrian's_tomb), just across the river from the Mausoleum; there too the details are unsubstantiated.

I’d suspect its equally likely that the imperial family fell victim to the need for mortar — burning marble is a common way to make quicklime, and those imperial urns will mostly have been showy marble affairs. The Colonna were not known for nicety in other areas so I don’t expect that delicacy in regards to a ready-made supply of building materials would have slowed them down much.

In any event, the Julio-Claudians all practiced cremation — so the likelihood of DNA emerging is low. Ironically the Colonna themselves (still going strong) eventually started claiming that they were descendants of the Julio-Claudian house. There are about 800 years of unaccounted for Colonnas you’d need to make the connection, but if you’re an optimist that’s your answer. However, if the Colonna really did have the blood of the Caesars in their veins, you’d wish they’d been a little more careful with the family plot.
