It’s definitely not plagiarism in the strict sense. If nothing else, to really plagiarize the Iliad would have a been a hopeless tasks in Augustus’ Rome, where most of the audience will have been intimately familiar with the Iliad and many of its more obscure derivatives.

The Aeneid fits into a genre that has a bunch of names, though “literary epic” might be a decent shorthand. The Iliad and the Odyssey are not, strictly speaking, “literature” — they both began as oral poetry, memorized and “sung” by professional bards. But because Homer became so central to Greek culture, Greek writers in later times constantly commented on and borrowed from his works. In particular, the literary culture that grew up around the Library of Alexandria was obsessed with Homer (in fact, [the oldest forms of punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchian_symbols) were actually invented to help mark dubious passages in competing editions of Homer).

One of the fruits of the Alexandrian love of Homer was an effort to revive epic poetry as a genre. Around the middle of the third century BC, [Apollonius of Rhodes ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Rhodes)— the head Librarian in Alexandria and a Homeric scholar of renown — wrote an original work of his own, the [Argonautica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonautica), a retelling of the story of Jason and the Argonauts. Nobody could mistake it for a copy of Homer, but the Argonautica is full of Homeric references; it’s a very bookish book which likes to display it’s mastery of obscure Homeric details.

The Aeneid is very much in the tradition which Apollonius created. Like the Argonautica it’s a standalone work, but, like the Argonautica, a good deal of what’s really going on is Virgil demonstrating his own mastery of Homeric lore to an audience which he expected would appreciate his virtuosity. A modern parallel might be James Joyce’s _Ulysses_ , which again is a not to be mistaken for the Odyssey but which definitely involves a tour-de-force demonstration of Homeric trivia.
