Unfortunately the Middle East already looks a lot like the great failure of the HRE, the [Thirty Years' War.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War)

The HRE was always a clunky, complex, and argumentative blob of squabbling minor powers with a couple of bigger ones jockeying for influence. Most of the time the got along well enough (though small wars and prolonged legal wrangles were common) but when a divisive issue came along the HRE was neither socially cohesive or legally strong enough to deal with it peacefully.

The 30 years war was a terrible, destructive war that spanned an entire generation (from 1618 to 1648). It involved most of the HRE's member states, but was rendered bloodier by outsiders intervening with their own agendas. It overlapped with -- but wasn't identical to -- a religious war between Catholics and Protestants; but the religious motives were often cited to justify land-grabs and expropriations. The war was fought largely by powerful private militaries operating with few constraints; traditional restraints of warfare fell apart over the course of the war, leading to terrible atrocities on all sides. The net result was a bloody, divided, and chaotic continent which took a long time to heal.

In short, the situation today __looks eerily familiar__ .
