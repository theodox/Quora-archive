This seems to be a surprisingly tough question to answer.

This [Historical UK Inflation And Price Conversion](http://safalra.com/other/historical-uk-inflation-price-conversion/) calculator gives good idea of the modern equivalent to period prices. It looks as though the average multiplier for a 19th century price is around 100X (!) although you'll see there are significant variations due to economic booms and busts. 

However, getting appropriate prices is very hard: the 'off the rack' clothing market did not really exist at the beginning of the period and was only getting started by its end: most suits, in particular, were bespoke and negotiated rather than standardized. Around 1900 a 'starter suit' was 20 -30 shillings or 1 - 1.5 pound, roughly 110 - 165 pounds today, but that was after machine manufacturing and ready to wear became common.

This page gives prices for 1888: [The Cost of Living in 1888](http://www.victorianweb.org/economics/wages4.html) which suggests that a suit would run 2 pounds (2.5 for a 'sunday suit') thus 280 - 336 pounds. A pair of boots (10 s, or todays 50 L). Again, this is well into the growth of machine manufacturing so the cloth prices and sundries (buttons, etc) will be less expensive that their 1840 equivalents.
