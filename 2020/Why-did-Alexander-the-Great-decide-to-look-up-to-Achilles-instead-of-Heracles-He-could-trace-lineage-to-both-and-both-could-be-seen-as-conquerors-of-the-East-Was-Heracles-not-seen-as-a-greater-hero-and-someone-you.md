# Why did Alexander the Great decide to look up to Achilles instead of Heracles? He could trace lineage to both and both could be seen as conquerors of the East. Was Heracles not seen as a greater hero and someone you would want to look up to instead?

Depending on context, Alexander was happy to lean on his connections to both ([and to Perseus, when that was convenient](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-face-with-flowing-hair-which-can-be-seen-on-the-cuirasses-of-Alexander-the-Great-in-the-Alexander-Mosaic-and-the-bust-of-Scipio-Africanus/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=88b9a394&srid=zLvM)). The difference, though, is that his connection to Achilles was more personal, where his connection to Heracles was a lot more institutionalized.

__Heracles__ 

Alexander absolutely did lean on Heracles as a mythological prop for his rule. The Argeads — Alexander’s paternal line, through Philip— all claimed descent from the royal family of Argos via [Temenus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temenus), a great-grandson of Heracles.

The iconography of Heracles was a pretty shopworn trope within Macedonia: Most folks who follow Alexander know he issued coins showing himself as Heracles:

However the practice goes all the way back to [Archelaus I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archelaus_I_of_Macedon), more than a century earlier. Archelaus deserves more credit than any other Macedonian king for “Hellenizing” Macedonia’s reputation with other Greeks.

The pro-Macedonian orator Isocrates — who was the most prominent voice advocating for Philip’s pan-Hellenic crusade against Persia — clearly knew about the Argead fondness for Heracles and used it to bolster his own claims:

> When Heracles saw that Hellas was rife with wars and factions and many other afflictions, he first brought these troubles to an end and reconciled the cities with each other and then showed by his example to coming generations with whom and against whom it was their duty to go to war. For he made an expedition against Troy, which was in those days the strongest power in Asia, and so far did he excel in generalship those who at a later time waged war against this same city, that, while they with the combined strength of Hellas found it difficult to take Troy after a siege which lasted ten years, he, on the other hand, in less than as many days, and with a small expedition, easily took the city by storm

Thus, both dynastic politics and the idea of a Macedonian-led Greek alliance made Heracles a significsnt part of Alexander’s official iconography.

__Achilles__ 

Alexander’s connection to Achilles, however, was a much more personal relationship. Almost any Dorian noble clan in the Greek world tried to trace itself back to Hercules. However Olympias’s family (the [Aeacids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molossians) of Epirus) were one of the few that could claim descent from Achilles. Unlike Heracles, Achilles had only one son: Neoptolemus, aka Pyrrhus — both names, significantly, which are very common in the Epirote royal family.

Since Epirotes had a somewhat dubious reputation in the rest of the Greek world for their primitive, ways, there were far fewer claimants to the heritage of Achilles. It was a less theologically exalted, but also a less common biographical connection to emphasize.

That Molossian connection gives this strain in Alexander’s thinking an interesting ambiguity. The Molossians occupied a strange, liminal place in the Greek world. While recognizable Greek in language and closely connected to the Greek mythological past they also lived a life which other Greeks saw as atavistic: monarchy, polygamy, a predominantly pastoral lifestyle and endemic levels of violence. The heritage of Achilles gave these primitive, “heroic” people unimpeachable Hellenic credentials — that’s why they liked to emphasize it in their dealings with outsiders — but it also put a kind of bracket around their status. They were seen as throwbacks to the ruder Greek past, a kind of living museum of lifestyles otherwise known primarily through Homer.

_Alexander’s second cousin,_ _[Pyrrhus of Epirus](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/pyrrhus-of-epirus/)_ _, is another famous “descendant of Achilles”.

As anybody who’s been bombarded with questions about Philip of Macedon and Demosthenes on Quora can attest, this situation was one that Alexander could easily understand. Macedonian ambitions in Greece provoked many charges of “barbarism” from political enemies, particularly in Athens. Alexander’s emphasis on his connection to Achilles provided an interesting counter to those accusations. As a descendant of Achilles Alexander was perforce a true Greek — but as a representative of a heroic age his violations of Greek norms were also pardonably old-fashioned, rather than uncivilized.

From a personal standpoint it probably didn’t hurt that — given both Philip’s dubious personal reputation in Greece and Alexander’s shaky relationship with his father — the connection to Achilles was not shared by his predecessor. Philip might be just another would-be Heraclid, but the son of Olympias was descended from the gods and heroes of legend on _both_ sides. It’s quite likely that Alexander’s identification with Achilles had something to do with the strains within his dysfunctional family and his odd Oedipal relation to his mother.

__Sources__ 

Which leads to a final point: Alexander’s interest in Achilles was real, but it was also personal. It had few impacts on the iconography and rhetoric of his rule.

There are countless coins showing Alexander-as-Heracles or Alexander-as-Zeus, but none of Alexander-as-Achilles. He famously visited the site of Troy and offered sacrifices to Achilles — but so had Spartan king Aegesilaus and, for that matter, Persian emperor Xerxes. He does seem to have sponsored a rebuilding of the shrines there, but nonetheless imagery from his reign does not lean very heavily on Achilles in ways that reflect sustained _official_ attention.

Instead, Alexander’s interest in Achilles shows up primarily in posthumous literary sources — particularly in Plutarch, Arrian, and Curtius. Which means we need to treat it carefully. For those writers Alexander’s fondness for Homeric citations and his habit of comparing himself to his illustrious forebearer offered a valuable literary device: Achilles, after all, is a _tragic_  hero, undone in part by his own hubris and love of glory. The brilliant young prince who overthrew the Persian empire turned into the brooding megalomaniac who demanded his friends worship him as a god and wasn’t above murdering the ones who demurred. To a Greek or Roman chronicler the destructive power of Achilles love of glory — which, as the the opening lines of the Iliad told every Greek, wrought a thousand agonies for the Achaeans — was a fitting metaphor for Alexander’s meteoric achievements and terrible wrath. The fact that both reached the pinnacle of glory and died young was another inevitable paralle.

That doesn’t mean Alexander’s interest in Achilles was a whole-cloth invention — but it does tend to mean we can’t read too much into its prominence. Describing it as an “obsession” or “idealization” is giving the sources (most of which are centuries after the fact) a bit too much power.
