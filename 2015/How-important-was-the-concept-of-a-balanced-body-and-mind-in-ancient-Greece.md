The gym teacher's favorite saying, _mens sana in corpore sano_ is Latin, not Greek, although it may be a borrowing from Thales: τίς εὐδαίμων, "ὁ τὸ μὲν σῶμα ὑγιής, τὴν δὲ ψυχὴν εὔπορος, τὴν δὲ φύσιν εὐπαίδευτος" :


> Who is blessed? He who has a healthy body, a resourceful mind and a teachable nature.


The ideal of balance in all things was was very central to Greek culture, appearing in lots of guises. The usual phrase was μηδὲν ἄγαν, "nothing too much" -- important enough for a big quote on the walls of the temple complex at Delphi. "Gymnasiums" in ancient Greece (their word) combined sports, health care and educational facilities.
