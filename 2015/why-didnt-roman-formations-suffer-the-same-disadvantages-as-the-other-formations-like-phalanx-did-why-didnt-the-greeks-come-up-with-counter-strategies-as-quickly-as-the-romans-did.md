# Why didn't Roman formations suffer the same disadvantages as the other formations (like phalanx) did? Why didn't the Greeks come up with counter-strategies as quickly as the Romans did?

The Greeks had a bunch of problems during the period of Greco-roman warfare, but phalanx tactics were not the worst. They were plagued by political disunity, shaky finances, and over-reliance on mercenaries -- all of which mattered more for the ultimate Roman victory than tactics did.

The actual period of Greco-Roman direct conflict was not that long: you could argue pretty fairly that the period of direct conflict between well matched powers lasted only from the time of Pyrrhus ( ca 275 BC) down to the Fourth Macedonian War (146 BC). The main field of Greek-Roman fighting were the four Macedonian Wars and the war with Antiochus. The lessons of all these wars are mixed; while the Romans won out, it's easy to see how the Roman advantages are more visible in hindsight than they were at the time. 

 The war with Pyrrhus was a more or less 'pure' Roman vs. Macedonian struggle, in which the Romans were able to manage a tactical draw but a strategic win -- the famous 'pyrrhic victory' was too costly to sustain, while Rome's ability to man and train new armies was something Pyrrhus could not match. Pyrrhus did pick up some Roman tactics as well, but his real problems were strategic, not tactical: he could not replace the professional core of his army as fast as the Romans could.

The key battles of the period are [Cynoscephalae](http://arehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cynoscephalae), [Pydna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pydna) and [Magnesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Magnesia). While all 3 are Roman victories, none was a flat out victory of manipular tactics against phalanxes. In all 3 cases, in fact, the phalanxes succeeded in pushing Roman legions back. At Cynoscephalae, the phalanx was disrupted by elephants and then hit from behind by a second legion; at Pydna, the successful phalanx attack pushed the Romans into rough ground where the phalanx became disordered and vulnerable; and at Magnesia a (Greek) heavy cavalry charge against Antiochus' supporting troops left the phalanx exposed and vulnerable (and the phalanx did try a 'square'-style every-way defence, but it was unable to maintain that and withdraw at the same time and was eventually broken).

In other words, the legions defeated the phalanxes in several key battles but the tactical lessons were not so striking that the case for re-arming and re-training the Greek kingdoms would be overwhelming. Several Greek states did introduce 'legionary' style units alongside phalanxes (more in [this link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_armies)) but these were supplements to, rather than replacements for, the phalanx. Since 'pure' legion-vs-phalanx battles were rare -- the Romans usually had no trouble finding Greek allies against other Greeks -- the obvious lesson at the time seems to have been "supplement your phalanx with medium infantry", not "replace your phalanx altogether".
