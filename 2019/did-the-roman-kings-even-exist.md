There’s no indisputable evidence for any of the [named individuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Rome) in the traditional list. There’s a long gap (roughly three hundred years) between the end of the monarchy and the beginnings of Roman historiography. Not surprisingly, there are a lot of legendary and folkloric elements in the stories about the kings and their era. It’s often noted that the traditional list of seven kings is very short for a period of about 250 years — it would work out to reigns which averaged more than 30 years apiece, an extraordinarily high number given ancient lifespans.

That said we _do_  have archaeological evidence for the existence of kings at Rome: we simply can’t tie that evidence too tightly to the traditional narratives.

The __[Lapis Niger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_Niger)__  is an archaic Latin monument which predates the Republic — it’s usually dated to about 560 BC — and mentions the king’s religious and judicial duties.

There’s also a fragment of pottery from the __[Regia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regia)__  — which later Roman tradition identified as the center of royal administration in Rome — inscribed with the word _rex,_ “king.” The oldest version of the building — which like many Roman buildings was rebuilt several times over the centuries — dates back to the royal era. That version of the Regia also shows Etruscan decorative motifs, which helps support the traditional story that the last kings were Etruscans.

There’s archaeological evidence for the existence of a Tarquin clan, though it comes from Vulci rather than Rome proper. The famous [Francois Tomb](https://www.ancient.eu/Francois_Tomb/) includes frescoes featuring an individual identified as _Cneve Tarchunies Rumach_ , “Gnaius Tarquinius the Roman.” Some scholars think this might be intended to be the traditional fifth king,[Tarquinius Priscus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Priscus), though given the different first names it’s relatively unlikely. Another individual is named as _Macstarna_ , who emperor Claudius (writing in the first century AD) identified with king [Servius Tullius. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servius_Tullius)Given the imperfect matches in names, the Francois Tomb frescoes don’t prove the traditional accounts are historic; but they do indicate that some elements of the traditional tales were in circulation within about two centuries of the traditional foundation of the Republic and not only in Latin-speaking Rome.

_The far right-hand figure is_ Cneve Tarchunies. _The second from the left is identifed as_ Macstarna_, who — at least according to the lost Etruscan history of Emperor Claudius — was the Roman king Serveius Tullius. From the Francois Tomb, circa 4th century BC: two centuries after the Republic but older than any of our written accounts._ 

So, there’s a reasonable basis for believing that kings ruled Rome before 509 BC. However it’s a much bigger stretch to believe that the traditions we see in, say, Livy about the royal era are an accurate depiction of who those kings were and how they ruled.
