Unless you’re already familiar with Greek, it’s usually easier to start with Latin.

Both languages are pretty different from English (and most other modern languages) and adding the complexity of a new alphabet and different orthography on top of all the other things that have to be learned is just making things harder on yourself. Moreover most English speakers will have a wider range of ‘faux-Latin’ words in their vocabulary — it’s easier to guess at unfamiliar words since so much of our vocabulary is Latinate.

I didn’t do it in this order (well, technically I did but one semester of a Latin elective in high school didn’t really amount to much) and I definitely felt pretty sluggish compared to classmates in Greek 101 who had good Latin already.

In terms of jobs? Well, the practical utility of both languages is primarily in education. There are more than a few jobs — though fewer than there used to be — teaching Latin in secondary schools. In Greek is primarily taught at the college level, although it is also taught in seminaries for clergypeople who want to read the New Testament in the original.

One thing you will get from either language is a strong foundation in grammar, which is often hard to come by in an ordinary American education.
