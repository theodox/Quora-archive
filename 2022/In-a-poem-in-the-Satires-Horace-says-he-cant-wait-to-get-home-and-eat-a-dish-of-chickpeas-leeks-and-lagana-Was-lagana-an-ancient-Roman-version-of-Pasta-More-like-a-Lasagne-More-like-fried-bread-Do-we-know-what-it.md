# In a poem in the Satires, Horace says he can't wait to get home and eat a dish of chickpeas, leeks, and lagana. Was lagana an ancient Roman version of Pasta? More like a Lasagne? More like fried bread? Do we know what it was?

It’s a Roman version of Greek [λάγανον](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=la%2Fganon&la=greek&can=la%2Fganon0&prior=l%C4%83g%C4%83num), and was basically something like crepes. Here’s a similar recipe from Apicius
