I see [User-10661484422791150723](https://www.quora.com/profile/User-10661484422791150723) got to the good stuff ahead of me :)

In general, the two halves cooperated although not always enthusiastically, but there were sometimes factions at each court who were willing to sacrifice the good of _Romanitas_  for poltical expediency. The two halves never went to war in their official capacities, but during the 4th century the numerous civil wars within the tetrarchy pitted the two halves against each other more than once; Ethan's answer covers this pretty thoroughly).

There was a lot of dubious politics in the run up to the sack of Rome (see [What were the sackings of Rome in the year 410 by the Goths and Vandals like? Were they organized or did they just ride through the city slashing, burning and pillaging?](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging) for background) Not mentioned there is the revolt of [Gildo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gildo) in 398, which was evidently encouraged by some factions in the East and would have transferred the invaluable grain supplies of Africa to eastern dominions. In 406 [Stilicho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho) threatened war with the East over control of Illyricum but it didn't come to pass. It's not clear what role east-west tensions played in his downfall. 

After the death of Constantius in 421 with no clear successor, the East proclaimed [Valentinian III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentinian_III) as western Augustus while there was a rival western claimant ([Joannes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joannes) of dubious legitimacy). This is right on the definitional border between 'civil wars' and 'east-west conflicts.' It's also hard to imagine how it worked for Eastern advantage in the end: Valentinian ranks right after Honorius of sack-of-Rome fame in the worst emperor ever sweepstakes.

For the rest of the period until the western empire completely disintegrated, the East acted as one of the many competing parties contending for what was left of the western polity: after the loss of Africa to the Vandals in 442 the western throne was increasingly irrelevant: the vital grain supplies were in the hands of the Vandals and most of Gaul and Italy were under barbarian control, even a forceful and talented "emperor" like [Majorian](http://www.roman-emperors.org/major.htm) was dependent on the backing of Germanic kingmakers like [Ricimer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricimer). While the empire survived as a shadowy source of legal tradition and legitimacy, it was finished as a political force so it would be misleading to think of conflict between the two halves at that point.
