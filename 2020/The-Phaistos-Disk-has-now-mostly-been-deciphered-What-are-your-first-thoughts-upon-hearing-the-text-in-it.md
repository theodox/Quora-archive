My initial reaction is skepticism. While this is clearly a serious scholarly endeavor, I think it’s a bit of a stretch, for reasons laid out in [this answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-currently-known-of-the-language-of-Phaistos-Disc-if-it-is-a-script/answer/Steve-Theodore). Basically, it’s assuming a Greek loan word as the key to the decipherment and that loan word its also a one-off coinage. Unless we find some more texts which would be rendered readable by these equivalences I think this remains very speculative.
