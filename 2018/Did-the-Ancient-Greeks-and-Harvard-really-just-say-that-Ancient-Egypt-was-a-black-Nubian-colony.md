Not exactly. The text being read is a Harvard University edition of [Diodorus Siculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus) — a Greek writer who lived in Sicily in the first century BC — so “Harvard” doesn’t enter into it except as a publisher of the translation.

Diodorus does say what the video quotes him as saying. The text being quoted is [here](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3A*.html) if you want to read it for yourself. However you should _also_ check out [this chapter ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1A*.html)from earlier in the same book, which provides a contradictory version in which the Egyptians are the first people and they went on to conquer the Ethiopians, rather than the other way around.

This isn’t a mistake: Diodorus’ work intentionally presents a bunch of contradictory claims from different non-Greek nations about their own histories. In his introduction he says this:

> with respect to the antiquity of the human race, not only do Greeks put forth their claims but many of the barbarians as well, all holding that it is they who were autochthonous [ie, “sprung from the soil”] and the first of all men to discover the things which are of use in life, and that it was the events in their own history which were the earliest to have been held worthy of record. So far as we are concerned, however, we shall not make the attempt to determine with precision the antiquity of each nation or what is the race whose nations are prior in point of time to the rest and by how many years, but we shall record summarily, keeping due proportion in our account, what each nation has to say concerning its antiquity and the early events in its history.

So - it’s definitely evidence that somebody in the Nubian kingdom of [Meroë ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB)(which, in Diodorus’ day was a well known, familiar trading partner for the Greek [Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom)) was _claiming_  that Egypt was an Ethiopian colony. It’s not evidence that Diodorus actually believed that to be the case. For what it’s worth, in his Egyptian chapter Diodorus repeats an Egyptian claim that Greece and Judea are both Egyptian colonies — in fact he lists a bunch of these colonies and then wraps up by saying :

> In general, the Egyptians say that their ancestors sent forth numerous colonies to many parts of the inhabited world, [due to] the pre-eminence of their former kings and their excessive population; but since they offer no precise proof whatsoever for these statements, and since no historian worthy of credence testifies in their support, we have not thought that their accounts merited recording.
