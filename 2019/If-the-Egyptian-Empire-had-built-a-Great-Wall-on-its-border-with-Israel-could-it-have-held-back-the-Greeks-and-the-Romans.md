# If the Egyptian Empire had built a Great Wall on its border with Israel, could it have held back the Greeks and the Romans?

It’s not likely they could build something more formidable than the environment.

The traditional invasion route from the east was a heavily fortified, narrow route between the ocean and a harsh desert: the Egyptians knew it as the “[Way of Horus](https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/newly-discovered-fortress-way-horus-egypt-stood-sentinel-020165)”. The only useful line of march was a 250 kilometer road between [Gaza ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Gaza)and [Pelusium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelusium), both strongly fortified cities. The coast offered few anchorages for invading ships, and the Way also ran along the [Serbonian Bog, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbonian_Bog)a mire of quicksand that swallowed up more than one invading force. Compared to these obstacles, a few meters of stonework were not very formidable obstacles.

When Alexander’s army marched into Egypt the walls of Gaza were about 20 meters high — three times the average height of the Great Wall. However Alexander’s troops had learned a lot about siege warfare during the [siege of Tyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre_(332_BC)) earlier in the same year. With a combination of earthen ramps (to assault the walls), undermining (to bring the walls down from below) and artillery they city was taken by storm after three attempts. Pelusium, however, surrendered without a fight: with Gaza in Alexander’s hands the barrier-desert now cut the Persian garrison of Egypt off from all hope of rescue, and the native Egyptians welcomed Alexander enthusiastically.

The Way of Horus was a strong defensive position but not impenetrable: fixed defenses never are. The Assyrians bypassed it in 671 BC by stockpiling food and water and then making an unexpected strike through the Sinai, which caught the Egyptians unprepared. In the [wars that followed Alexander’s death](https://deadliestblogpage.wordpress.com/2018/03/14/diadochi-macedonian-game-of-thrones-part-7-perdiccas-invades-egypt/), one of the feuding armies used a similar trick — however they were stopped in a horrible battle on the banks of the Nile near Pelusium, where the attacking troops were mauled by crocodiles and hippopotami as well as by the defending army. The Persians captured Pelusium in 525 BC (according to Herodotus, they did it by exploiting the superstitions of the defenders, [covering their advance with a mass of cats](https://www.ancient.eu/article/43/the-battle-of-pelusium-a-victory-decided-by-cats/) whom the Egyptians would not risk harming).
