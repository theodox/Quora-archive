There were a lot of Asian Greeks at Salamis. In the run up to the battle, the Greek admiral Themistocles [had propaganda messages calling on them to defect placed in visible spots along the coastline](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.8.22&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126) — reasoning, correctly, that even if they didn’t induce many of them to switch sides that the Persians might be less willing to rely on them in the coming fight.

At the sea battle., the Persian is traditionally numbered at around 1200 ships. According to Herodotus, whose numbers are usually seen as inflated, the largest contingents were Phoenician (300 ships), Egyptian (200), Cypriot — which included both Greeks, Cypriots, and Phoenician sailors — (150), and Cilician (100). The King’s Ionian Greek subjects furnished 100 ships, the Aeolians 60, the Dorians of Asia Minor 60, and the various islands of the Cyclades 17.

Macedonians in this era didn’t have a fleet (or if they did, it’s unrecorded). They provided cavalry for the land forces, and fought at Plataea on the Persian side although they were clearly playing both sides of the conflict. The Macedonian king [Alexander I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Macedon) leaked Persian movements to the Greek commanders in the runup to the battle. After the Greek victory, Xerxes sent home a large contingent — the Macedonians turned on them as they began to cross the Strymon river and destroyed most of the Persian force.
