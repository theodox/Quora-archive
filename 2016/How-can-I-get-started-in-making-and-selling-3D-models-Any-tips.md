You can sell models on [Turbodquid](http://www.turbosquid.com).

Unfortunately you'll find that it's extremely competitive - there are some really high quality models on there but there is a lot of lower and mid-range stuff that crowds the lower price points .

It's pretty hard to stand out in that crowded field. Once you've got a good body of work and a few clients who assume you are doing professional level work you can start to charge more - which means you'll get higher fees but also a much more critic audience.

While it's possible to make pretty good money it is not easy - there is a lot of talent out there. If you are really dedicated to honing your craft it's certainly a good supplement to more traditional forms of making a living from 3D.
