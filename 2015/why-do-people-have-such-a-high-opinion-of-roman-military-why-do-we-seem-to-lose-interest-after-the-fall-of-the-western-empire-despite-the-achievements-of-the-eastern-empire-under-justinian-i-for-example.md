# Why do people have such a high opinion of Roman military? Why do we seem to lose interest after the fall of the western empire despite the achievements of the eastern empire? (Under Justinian I for example)?

"We" (let's say, "native English speakers" for lack of a better "we" in this context) come from a cultural tradition that's ultimately rooted in the western/Latin/Catholic half of the Roman world. Even as laypeople we are much more familiar with bits and pieces of West Roman lore than we are with East Rome and its very different history. Your average TV viewer can be counted on to recognize at least a chariot race or a toga, but is much less likely to know _spatharios_  from a _kataphractos._

_I can't even start to come up with a Byzantine equivalent to Charlton Heston..._ 

That difference in familiarity reflects long centuries of institutional reinforcement: The rediscovery of (Roman) antiquity in the (Italian) Renaissance, the veneration of the Roman Republic during the Enlightenment, and the broad popularization of 'Classics' in the 19th and early 20th century education. There's also the long shadow of Edward Gibbon: when the only book about you that most people have ever even heard of is both eminently quotable and deeply hostile, it's extremely hard to earn respect. So, for most Anglophones, Byzantium is at best a footnote; most of us have a better general sense of Indian or Chinese history than we do of Byzantine. 

It's also worth remembering that military history reflects more than one set of interests. It includes serious historical inquiry and History-Channel razzmatazz, people looking for eternal principles of strategy and people looking for tales of derring-do. A lot of the time it's more or less like sports fandom, where we cheer for our favorites and boo the bad guys.

So there are really two forces at work: cultural pre-eminence and, if we're honest, _entertainment value_ feature pretty highly in the way the history is retold. The way the history gets handed down, and by whom, matters more than we'd like to admit.

For example: Rome's struggle against Hannibal is marvelous pulp-fodder -- it's got strong characters (Hannibal, Fabius, Scipio), great drama (Cannae! Trasimene!) and of course _elephants._  We know about it because it's recorded in great, picturesque if often patriotically embellished detail by Livy).

_Made for pulp_ 

 By contrast [Heraclius' epic war against the Persians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_War_of_602%E2%80%93628#Historiography) -- which one contemporary did, in fact, compare to the second Punic War -- reaches only through a patchwork of fragmentary encyclopedia entries and mentions in Syriac, Ethiopian and Coptic sources that are rarely translated into English. The most interesting source is [ Theophanes ](http://deremilitari.org/2013/06/the-campaigns-of-emperor-herakleios-620-6-according-to-the-chronicle-of-theophanes-confessor/), who does have a good eye for detail but is constrained both by his year-by-year format and also by his rather church-y style. You have to invest more than a little imagination to appreciate the daring and resourcefulness that the Byzantines showed against a powerful and determined adversary. And -- with reams of easy-reading Livy or Tacitus to go on, only specialists will make the effort.

_In 1447, when Della Francesca painted this scene of Heraclius defeating Chosroes, it was still more or less 'our' history. But after the rediscovery of the Roman Republic, and after Gibbon, it was 'theirs'_ 

The chest-thumping side of military history also prefers conquerors to defenders. The Rome we think of is the Rome of conquest: of Carthage, Gaul, of Alexandria. The long years of defense are much less familiar: The [Marcomannic Wars](http://Marcomannic Wars) represent as grave a crisis as Hannibal's invasion of Italy, but (except for a throwaway scene at the beginning of _Gladiator_ ) they don't make it into the popular histories. Who remembers how Aetius faced down the "invincible"Atilla the Hun at [Chalons](http://Chalons) ? 

For the Byzantines -- who were almost always on the defensive against powerful enemies this bias lessens their swagger. Despite the incredible feat of surviving for a millennium in a brutal neighborhood, their meagre territorial gains fail to stimulate the imagination of your average military history fan. [Belisarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belisarius), one of the very few Byzantine generals with name recognition in the west, is remembered for the re-conquest of Italy. Conquerors [Nikephoros II Phokas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikephoros_II_Phokas) or [John Kourkouras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kourkouas) didn't gobble up huge chunks of territory, Caesar-style -- and of course, in the English-speaking world at least those chunks of Balkan or Near-Eastern territory are unfamiliar and less 'real' than Gaul or Britannia. Many of the great heroes of Byzantine history are survivors, rather than conquerors: [Constantine IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_IV) , [Leo III the Isaurian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_III_the_Isaurian), or the doomed [Constantine XI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_XI_Palaiologos)

Last but not least: one important reason the Byzantines survived as long as they did is because they didn't play by the rules of chivalry: they were clever, tenacious and patient -- and not above using gold to achieve what they could not do with steel. If you want your state to last a thousand years, that's not a bad way to go. But it's less romantic (and appeals less to the guts-and-glory market) than old-fashioned _dulce et decorum pro patria mori_ bravado.

So: the lesser prominence of Byzantine military achievement isn't fair. But that's how this particular game is played: style points count. 

 For what its worth the pros often give higher praise to the Byzantines than pop culture does. Luttwak's [The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire](http://amzn.to/1SkI6RU) is a good example (and you can pair it up with [The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire](http://amzn.to/1kOo3R0) by the same author for a good compare-and-contrast.
