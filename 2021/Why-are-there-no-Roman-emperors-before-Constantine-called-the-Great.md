Short answer: there were not a lot of emperors before Constantine who shared the same names, so we don’t need any way to distinguish them apart from their personal names. But Constantine was the first of a long line of similarly-named emperors and it was necessary to be clear about _which_  Constantine one wanted to talk about .

People always make the mistake of treating “the Great” as a term of blanket approbation. What they tend to forget is that those, er, “Roman” [numerals after royal names are a medieval convention which seem to have emerged around the thirteenth century or so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regnal_number#History). This probably arose because so many Popes recycled the same limited set of names: when you’re hunting around for “the decree of Pope John” in 1200 you have 20-odd sets of things to choose from. In the less sophisticated bureaucracies of earlier times, you could get away with a less formal system: that’s why, for example the Carolingian clan turned up names like this:

Charles “the Hammer”

Charles “the Great”

Charles “the bald”

Charles “the Simple”

Charles “the Child”

Louis

Louis “the young”

Louis “the younger”

Louis “the German”

Louis “the Child”

Louis “the Stammerer”

Eventually you give up on this kind of nickname-based categorization and resort to numerals — which is how you end up with “John the XXII” and so on. This practice was definitely in place by the 1270’s and may go back a couple of hundred years before then — in western Europe, at any rate. [It was not, however, very popular in the eastern Roman empire at any time](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-later-Byzantine-emperors-use-regnal-numbers/answer/Eleftherios-Tserkezis?ch=10&share=629e9706&srid=zLvM), and even today is more common in English than in many other languages.

In Constantine’s case there were only two sets of emperors before him who shared a name: the Gordians ([I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_I), [II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_II), and [III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_III)) — I and II reigned side-by-side, and only lasted three weeks on the throne; III reigned for five years. And the Phillippi, who were distinguished as “[Philip the Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_the_Arab)” and “[Philip the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_(Roman_emperor)).” (between them less than six years). If anybody was particularly interested in distinguishing between them it does not show up in our ancient sources. Both the two Philips and the first two Gordians ruled as father-son co-emperors but neither of the younger two lasted long on their own, lessening any interest in distinguishing them.

There were, on the other hand, more than a millennium’s worth of Constantines. Constantine I was a towering figure among that coterie: he reigned for 30 years after a century in which the average tenure was less than three years and founded a dynasty with produced five emperors (including one Constantine and two Costantii). But — more importantly for the nomenclature — his pivotal role in the creation of the eastern empire meant that there were many Constantines yet to come — the last one, Constantine XI, died heroically in the final fall of Constantinople to the Turks, a more than thousand years after Constantine built the imperial city.

The old nick-name based system persisted a long time, [particularly in Byzantium](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-later-Byzantine-emperors-use-regnal-numbers/answer/Eleftherios-Tserkezis?ch=10&share=629e9706&srid=zLvM), producing Constantines like [Constantine IV “the Bearded”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_IV)** , [Constantine IX “the duellist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_IX_Monomachos)”*** , and [Constantine V “the shit-named.” ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_V)Given the competition, it’s easy to see how one of these Constantines looms above the rest. His greatness may be a relative, rather than an absolute, quantity — but as there’s no question which Constantine is the most consequential (this is equally true of Theodosius “the Great” and Justinian “the Great”, both of whom had less-successful inheritors with the same names). By contrast Basil II — a “great” emperor by many standards — is only “[Basil the Bulgar-slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_II)”, since he only needs to be distinguished from one other Basil, “the Macedonian.” The last centuries of Byzantium are awash in nickname-less emperors although at least, by that time, family names had become common. which helped a little bit.

TLDR: cognomens like “the Great” aren’t really terms of approval, they are shorthand for distinguishing between similarly named individuals in a world where numerical ordering of monarchs was not used. In the case of Roman emperors the recycling of names — and thus the need for distinguishing nicknames — didn’t really start until Constantine, which is why you don’t see similar names for many earlier emperors.****



* there’s actually _eleven_ : western historians usually refer to the British usurper [Flavius Claudius Constantinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_III_(Western_Roman_emperor)) as Constantine III, but for east-Roman historians it’s [Heraclius Constantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_III_(Byzantine_emperor)) who gets the III (to distinguish him from his father, Heraclius). 
** Constantine The Bearded actually didn’t have the beard — his father, [Constans II “the bearded” ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constans_II)had the beard, but, lacking handy numerals, Byzantine historians recycled the nickname. Note lack of beard below:

*** This name came from his father’s surname, Mononachos, “duellist” or “gladiator” — the actual emperor was not much of a military man.

**** Some early imperial writers made a point of distinguishing “Caesar the dictator” from Caesar Augustus, since technically they both bore the name Gaius Julius Caesar. Pompey “the Great” had a well-known father with the same name, so he did get a “great” though not without comment from contemporaries:

> It troubled him to see Pompey so successful in all his undertakings; that he had had a triumph before he was capable to sit in the senate, and that the people had surnamed him Magnus, or the great. When somebody was saying Pompey the Great was coming, he smiled, and asked him, "How big is he?”
