I immediately think of [Funes el Memorioso](http://vigeland.caltech.edu/ist4/lectures/funes%20borges.pdf), in the story by Jose Luis Borges. However if you’re looking for a classical example there’s two obvious candidates:

[Mnemosyne](https://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanisMnemosyne.html) is, literally, the goddess of memory (you’re recognize her name in “mnemonic” and “amnesia”). Many ancient poets would start their works by invoking Mnemosyne — partly to help them remember their own lines (since ancient poetry was intended to recited, not read) and partly to ensure that their own works would be remembered; here’s a character in one of Plato’s dialogues, a minor playwright:

> … But besides the gods and goddesses whom you have mentioned, I would specially invoke Mnemosyne; for all the important part of my discourse is dependent on her favour, and if I can recollect and recite enough of what was said by the priests and brought hither by Solon, I doubt not that I shall satisfy the requirements of this theatre.

If you’d prefer a historical example you might want [Simonides of Ceos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simonides_of_Ceos), who was said to be the inventor of the “[memory palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)” technique for training the memory. That trick became a standard way for ancient orators — who often had to deliver hours-long speeches without notes — to memorize efficiently and accurately. There’s a great fictional example in Gene Wolfe’s [Soldier in the Mist](https://amzn.to/2X0OB6x) series, where the main character is recovering from a traumatic brain injury and is taught the palace technique as a way of recovering long term memory.*

Simonides’ big rival in the memory championship was [Apollonius of Tyana](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/apollonius-of-tyana/), a first-century wonder-worker.

> When [Apollonius] reached the age of a hundred, he still surpassed Simonides in point of memory, and he used to chant a hymn addressed to Mnemosyne, in which it is said that everything is worn and withered away by time, whereas time itself never ages, but remains immortal because of memory.



* Wolfe’s [Book of the New Sun](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075JL493G/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i1), incidentally, is a science fiction work but its protagonist is both blessed and cursed with an eidetic memory. Wolfe was heavily influenced by Borges, which brings this full circle.
