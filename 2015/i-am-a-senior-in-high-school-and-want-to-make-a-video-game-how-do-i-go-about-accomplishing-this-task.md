A lot depends on your background.

If you already know some programming, the most popular platform is [Unity](http://unity3d.com/5?gclid=CLD-nsLlhcMCFUKUfgodG7oAaQ), which can be programmed in C# or a dialect of Javascript. It's very capable but also has a lot of intro-level features and a huge community on the web for learning. 

If you have no programming experience and want to learn about design, you might want to get your feet wet with game creation toolkits like [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/), [GameSalad](http://gamesalad.com/) or [Clickteam Fusion](http://www.clickteam.com/clickteam-fusion-2-5-free-edition), which help you create games using graphic interfaces and a more 'connect-the-dots' approach. The lack of programming limits the kinds of things you can do (there's no way to get fancy AI behavior or complex behavior without some programming) but if you can manage a reasonably complex app like Photoshop or DreamWeaver you should be able to make something fun and learn more about how games are made.
