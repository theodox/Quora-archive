Sort of. Speaking as a survivor of a 'let's bring a PC quality gaming experience to tablet' project (the late, lamented [Moonrise](https://undeadlabs.com/2015/08/news/the-sun-sets-on-moonrise/)) I'm pretty convinced that PCs, consoles and handhelds are different because people expect different things from them and not because of technical limitations.

_Moonrise... sigh. Making it pretty was the easy part._  

Usually when people look at this problem they are thinking about graphics horsepower. While it's true that handhelds of all types are significantly less powerful than good-quality gaming PCs, they are still pretty great by historical standards. Graphics oriented tablets like the an NVidia Shield or an iPad Pro are already in the same ballpark as mid-tier laptops and lower-mid desktops in terms of graphics horsepower, particularly if you only look at the graphics throughput.

However (as an artist, it pains me to say this) graphics is far from the whole story here. During those windows when PCs and consoles are competitive graphically, console and PC gaming remain very different experiences even for the same titles. Couch play and desk play aren't the same thing; controller play and WASD play aren't the same thing either. And it seems pretty clear by now that mobile gaming is a third thing, with very different audiences, usage patterns, and design constraints. Graphics horsepower and input devices make a big difference, of course : but the real difference comes from the physical setting and social context of how people play games on consoles, PC and tablets/phones.

If you look at some efforts to port popular games from other platforms to mobile, it's often amazing how well developers have done at tackling the hardware barriers. A [MOBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena) like [Vainglory](http://www.vainglorygame.com/) for example can show gameplay footage that looks as good as most shipping PC MOBAs (hell -- given the heavy weighting of Korean and Chinese PC players in MOBA play, an iPad pro is solidly mid range compared to many of the machines running DOTA or League of Legends). Nevertheless Vainglory hasn't been able to rack up the kinds of mind-boggling numbers that the big kids have: it's a great adaptation to the space, but the space itself just doesn't seem conducive to the long play sessions and elbow-to-elbow social environments where the MOBA crowd hangs out. Similar effects seem to keep beautiful, graphically accomplished racing games like [Real Racing](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/real-racing-3/id556164008?mt=8) from seriously denting the console driving game business. Even a turn based game like XCOM -- which had some notable success on IOS and more than competent console ports -- recently [went PC-only](http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/05/why-xcom-2-had-to-be-pc-exclusive) because the kind of gamers who really want to spend 100 hours grinding through Ironman mode (eg: me!) tend to cluster on PC. 

I don't think these examples are a reflection of what tablets can do: it's a reflection of how people want to use tablets. Crowded PC cafes and dorm rooms are where MOBAs really live. Racing games are more fun on big screens, especially side-by-side with somebody on the same couch. Strategy games with double- or triple-digit hour investments need to be savored in long sessions, not while managing a burger in your other hand during lunch. On the other hand something like [80 Days](http://www.frogwares.com/game/80days.html) would be pretty insipid on a big monitor. The play styles and the social context (or lack thereof) they imply are really what drives the separation of these games. When people try to drag a game out of its natural context the results are rarely pretty: that's why the 'dual stick' control scheme for handheld games rarely works: it's a concept from the alien console world dragged kicking and screaming into a place it doesn't belong

Like any business, there's a serious "you don't know till you try" factor. There are probably genres from the PC/Console space that will find a new home on mobile or (more likely) morph into new mobile-first genres with roots in the other platforms. There will even be a couple of mobile titles -- which can be very pretty these days -- heading the other way. But I think the genre expectations are much less fungible than the technical barriers in terms of setting
