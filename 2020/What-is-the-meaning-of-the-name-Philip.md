___Phil-hippos___ _,_ “lover of horses” in the original Greek.

But not, you know, in a _weird_ way.

Horses were very expensive in ancient Greece. An aristocrat was a _hippeis_ , a horseman, much as a later European aristocrat might be a “cavalier” or a “chevalier”, that is, a knight. So, horse-themed names were a mark of status. Other examples include _Archippos_ , “horse master” or _Hippocrates,_ “powerful horse.”
