# In Ancient Rome, Ancient Greece or other ancient slave-owning societies, did anyone ever buy a slave in order to have sex with him/her? Are there records of this?

It was completely common. Greek and Roman brothels, male and female, were staffed primarily by slaves, and sexual access to one’s own slaves was considered an ordinary part of the business of owning people.

___Note: explicit images and language below___ 

There were some constraints on sexual behavior with slaves. By far the strongest prohibition was on male slaves having sex with female mistresses, because that was regarded as a threat to the bloodline of the owning family. This was nominally a capital crime (for the slave). For a free man to be the receiving partner in male-male sex was also regarded as degrading and was intermittently outlawed. Outside those two limited legal rules, however, the only boundaries were customary, not legal. Sexual abuse of slaves wasn’t legally limited until the sixth century.

As for records — the sources very rarely reflect the viewpoint of the slaves themselves, but they do show the prevalence of sexual slavery. The plight of a free woman (or sometimes a man) who falls into slavery and is sexually vulnerable was a common plot element in plays and stories; so are tales about men falling in love with slave girls and going to great lengths to procure them. To pick one example at random the comedy [Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_(play)) by [Plautus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plautus) centers on the conflict between a young merchant, who has bought himself a particularly beautiful slave concubine, and his lecherous father who wants to take the girl for himself, with a variety of social and domestic complications.

The reality, of course, was not amusing. Here, for example, the Roman satirist Martial derides a lecherous master who had bankrupted himself buying up young boys — an indication both of what kinds of powers a master could exercise, the exploitation inherent in the system, and its effect on the masters themselves:

> Tucca, are you capable of selling those you bought for a hundred thousand? Are you capable of selling your masters with them crying, Tucca? Are you not moved by their charms, their words, and their rough complaints, by their necks wounded by your tooth? Oh, outrage! With their tunic lifted, their groins are revealed on both sides, and their dicks, crafted by your hand, are inspected. If you desire money paid out, then sell silver, tables, murrine stone, land, a house, sell old slaves, they will forgive you, sell your father's slaves: Sell everything else, wretch, in order not to sell your boys. It is extravagant to buy them - for who doubts or denies this? - but it is much more extravagant to sell them.

[Martial, 11.70](https://people.well.com/user/aquarius/martial.htm)

The “hundred thousand” here would be a hundred thousand sesterces — the cost of a substantial estate. The point of the insult, here, is that Tucca will part with everything before his “masters” — the youths he theoretically owns but who, Martial says, really have the power over _him_ .

The master who becomes obsessed with his own sex-slaves was a stock figure of Roman moralizing. This kind of behavior was an essential moral hazard of a system which gave some people so much power over others. Suetonius’ description of emperor Tiberius is — one sincerely hopes — an exaggerated slander but it gives a good idea of the demons lurking in the slave-owner’s psyche:

> ..having gained the licence of privacy, and being as it were out of sight of the citizens, he at last gave free rein at once to all the vices which he had for a long time ill concealed…. He had a dinner given him by Cestius Gallus, a lustful and prodigal old man, who had once been degraded by Augustus and whom he had himself rebuked a few days before in the senate, making the condition that Cestius should change or omit none of his usual customs, and that nude girls should wait upon them at table… On retiring to Capri he devised a pleasance for his secret orgies: teams of wantons of both sexes, selected as experts in deviant intercourse and dubbed analists, copulated before him in triple unions to excite his flagging passions. Its bedrooms were furnished with the most salacious paintings and sculptures, as well as with an erotic library, in case a performer should need an illustration of what was required. Then in Capri's woods and groves he arranged a number of nooks of venery where boys and girls got up as Pans and nymphs solicited outside bowers and grottoes: people openly called this "the old goat's garden," punning on the island's name.

> He acquired a reputation for still grosser depravities that one can hardly bear to tell or be told, let alone believe. For example, he trained little boys (whom he termed tiddlers) to crawl between his thighs when he went swimming and tease him with their licks and nibbles; and unweaned babies he would put to his organ as though to the breast, being by both nature and age rather fond of this form of satisfaction

> [Life of Tiberius, 42ff.](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html).

Outside of literature, there’s abundant evidence for the ordinary business of sexual slavery. The most famous concrete examples are the [brothels of Pompeii](https://theconversation.com/the-grim-reality-of-the-brothels-of-pompeii-88853), which were staffed primarily by slaves, but there are also many examples of things like sale contracts, court cases, and other bureaucratic traces of the way slave societies treat their victims.
