His Roman wife was [Octavia the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavia_the_Younger), the half-sister of his onetime ally [Octavian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus). Besides the power-political conflict between Octavian and Antony the family drama rendered the situation even more acute; Antony’s abandonment of Octavia was very unpopular at Rome where it was seen as a very sleazy, un-Roman thing to do. After Antony’s death Octavia was widely respected for her maternal care for Antony’s children (both by his previous wife Fulvia and by Cleopatra).
