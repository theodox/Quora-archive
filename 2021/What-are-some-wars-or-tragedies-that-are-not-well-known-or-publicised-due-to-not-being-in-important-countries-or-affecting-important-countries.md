One of the deadliest volcanic eruptions in human history happened in the western hemisphere just over a century ago. But it rarely makes anybody’s list of “top ten disasters”.

The city of [Saint-Pierre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Pierre,_Martinique) in Martinique, in the French west Indies, had a population of over 28,000 people in 1902. When [Mont Pelée](https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/benchmarks-may-8-1902-deadly-eruption-mount-pelee) began to exhibit signs of activity in April of that year many people from outlying towns closer to the mountain fled to St-Pierre — since the city was separate from the mountain by two valleys it was hoped that it was a safe haven. Unfortunately it was not.

On May 5, a sudden, violent lava flow from the mountain flowed down the valley of the Riviere Blanche into the see — it didn’t hit St-Pierre, but the earthquakes which accompanied it caused a tsunami which heavily damaged the town’s waterfront. The seismic disturbances send wildlife from the interior of the island toward the coast — including 2-meter-long, poisonous pit vipers — in the direction of the doomed city. On May 7 an explosion rocked a volcano on the neighboring island of St. Vincent, killing more than a thousand people, but convincing many in St-Pierre that the crisis had passed its climax.

However the next day — May 8, 1902 — a massive pyroclastic flow of superheated gas screamed down the mountain at about 100 meters per second. The town was wiped from the map in under three minutes; only walls which were oriented parallel to the flow survived. The brass bell of the church of St-Etienne was hurled from its tower, melting in mid-flight:

The pyroclastic flow was similar to the one which killed everyone in Pompeii, but seems to have reached higher temperatures — almost 400°C / 750°F. Ships in the harbor were set aflame. It was four days before rescuers could brave the fire and ruins to look for survivors. They found only two: one man on the far outskirts of town, and [Ludger Sylbaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludger_Sylbaris), who survived in a fortified jail cell which had once been an ammunition magazine. A little girl survived, badly burned, because she had rowed out to sea before the eruption.

The destruction of St-Pierre was the first pyroclastic type explosion witnessed in modern times. Observations of the disaster helped to revolutionize our understanding of how volcanoes threaten human lives. It was probably the second or third deadliest volcanic disaster in history (certainly, deadlier than Pompeii).

Apart for few weeks of media sensation in 1902, and the circus career of Ludger Sylbaris, the St-Pierre catastrophe did not enter the popular consciousness as an epoch-making event. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 is far better known, for example, but four times more people died in tiny St-Pierre.
