The elephant didn't show up in warfare in the western Mediterranean until later. The Romans first saw elephants on the battlefield when [Pyrrhus of Epirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus) invaded Italy in 280 BC. Pyrrhus got his elephants from [the Ptolemaic kingdom's elephant breeding program](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-historical-fact-you-know-off-the-top-of-your-head/answer/Steve-Theodore), which only started in the preceding century. The last recorded Roman war against the Etruscans had concluded in 351 BC, 70 years before. Moreover, the Romans didn't actually make much use of elephants on their own account until later still. They were never heavily dependent on them as a military asset.*

_* They had no easy source of domestic supply, if nothing else. The Ptolemies'_ _[North African elephants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_elephant)_ _were only modestly effective in battle; the larger, better trained Indian elephants were hard to get, particularly once the Parthian empire monopolised the land route to India in the 2d century BC._
