# Alexander Hool says that Alexander only conquered the northern half of the Persian Empire. Is there any merit to this?

I guess you could make a verbally hyperspecific claim along the lines of the fact that Alexander’s key battles against Persian imperial forces were all “northerly” — Issus, Granicus, and Arbela were all several hundred miles north of the Persian heartland in Fars. Most of Alexander’s fighting after the collapse of centralized resistance was in Bactria and Margiana. So if you define “conquest” as “actually marching through” then… sorta.

Of course Alexander also occupied Susa, Babylon and Persespolis. There was one fierce battle at the [Persian Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gates). That last one doesn’t get the same kind of press as the big 3 because it was a hammer-and-anvil fight that can’t be dissected carefully as regards tactics, but it was still a serious confrontation.

FWIW though Alexander had satraps in all of the western provinces, including Persis and Babylon from 330 afterwards, and at the time of his death he’d installed them in the old Persian southern and eastern ones as well. There were persistent resistance movements in Cappadocia and Paphlagonia, neither of which really settled down until Alexander’s death. His eastern marches were almost all through former Persian territory, either quashing Persian holdouts or reasserting “imperial” authority over locals who saw the end of the Persian empire as a liberation from foreign domination. If anything, the main areas which he didn’t scoop up were on the empire’s vaguely defined northern fringe.

The nature of the empire itself meant that there was never going to be a kind of broad occupation — actually settling Macedonian garrisons in every city and town in the former Persian territory was never going to happen, but the Persians had not done that either. Most people in the Persian empire only dealt with “Persians” at tax time; otherwise they were ruled by local elites who kicked some tribute up to the Great King in return for the privilege of retaining their local power. So, Alexander simply did more or less what Cyrus had done before him: replace the top layer of a very vertical hierarchy of power. Most of the local power structures remained in place, the primary difference was who collected the tribute. The real measure of success was how many places that had once sent annual kickbacks to Darius did the same to Alexander — and the answer was (apart from Cappadocia, which managed to say independent until a couple of years after Alexander’s death) they pretty much all did.

This map give a misleading impression, because it conveys the idea that all of this former-Persian land was somehow welded together into a cohesive whole. It wasn’t — though it had not been under the Persians either. But it does show that Alexander was able to appoint local commanders to extort money from the locals in almost all of the places where the Persians had previously run their own protection racket. The primary power gap is Cappadocia, and the belt of territory between the Black Sea and the Caspian which was tributary but essentially independent before Alexander and became fully independent during his conquests.
