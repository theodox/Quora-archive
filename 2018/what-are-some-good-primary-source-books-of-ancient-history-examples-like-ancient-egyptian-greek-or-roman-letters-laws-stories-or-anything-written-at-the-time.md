If you’re looking for a fast collection, Fordham University’s [Internet History Sourcebooks](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/asbook09.asp) has a good selection of [Greek ](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/asbook07.asp), [Roman](http://If you’re looking for a fast collection, Fordham University’s Internet History Sourcebooks (https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/asbook09.asp) has a good selection of Greek (https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/asbook07.asp), Roman\), [Egyptian](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/asbook04.asp) and [Mesopotamian](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/asbook03.asp) primary source links aimed at undergraduates. There’s also a separate section for [Roman Law](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/asbook-law.asp)

If you want to go past the History 101 level, the true treasure trove is the giant garbage dump — literally — at [Oxyrhynchus, in Egypt](http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/). Its an unparalleled window into the messy realities of daily life in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt including unsexy stuff like lawsuits, divorces, private letters, even shopping lists — precisely the sort of material that otherwise gets left out of the white-marble classics. The best collection for nonspecialists is [Life in Egypt Under Roman Rule](http://amzn.to/2CSwxiM) by Naftali Lewis. While there have been some important new discoveries in the couple of decades since the book was published it has a lot of evocative material along with good notes.

In the more high-toned end of things there are several famous collections of letters which give a good idea of antiquity. Probably the most famous collection belongs to the Roman statesman[ Cicero](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0022%3Ayear%3Dvolume+1+intro) — a key player in the last years of the Roman Republic. Among the recipients of the letters are Julius Caesar and Brutus, his assassin. These are not exactly “private” letters, since the author was a politician who knew they would be published — but they are real-time records of some very important events. Another prolific letter-writer was the bureaucrat and literary man [Gaius Plinius or “Pliny”](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/pliny-letters.asp) — a friend and confidant of emperor Trajan in the late first century, his letters cover a number of interesting subjects including the persecution of Christians and the destruction of Pompeii. Another friend of emperors is the scholar [Marcus Cornelius Fronto](http://www.attalus.org/info/fronto.html) — who despite his Latin sounding name was a Berber from North Africa. There are fewer letters in Greek; the letters of [Isocrates](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0246) are mostly political in nature, intended for public consumption. The Epistles of Paul in the Bible are of course examples of Greek letter writing in the first century — while they have theological subject matter they also touch on mundane issues of how small communities functioned.

For legal material there is a wealth of material — way more than can be covered easily in a readable answer. Here’s a few highlights, however:

The [speeches of Greek orators](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus%3Acorpus%3Aperseus%2CGreek%20Rhetoric) are a mix of political and private matters, mixing addresses intended for a voting audience with court cases, sometimes on very mundane matters (the link above will go to Greek versions, but the translations are provided on the right hand side of each page. It’s a clunky UI, but useful material). [Cicero’s speeches ](http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/cicero-orations-vol-1)also include both defenses and prosecutions delivered in Roman courts. The complete text of the ancient Roman laws known as [The Twelve Tables](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/twelve_tables.asp) are online in English, as are most of the various [collections of Roman law ](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/Halsall/sbook-law.asp#ROMAN LAW)and commentaries though these are often a bit of a slog.

If you have a more narrow focus, mention in a comment.
