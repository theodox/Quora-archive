Developers tend to be pretty cynical about these things because they have to live with some unpleasant truths:

__Most games that get thought of don't get made__ . Convincing somebody to loan you tens of millions of dollars on an unproven idea is very hard. Minecraft was self-published by a hobbyist : it would never have gotten funding from a traditional publisher if it required the kind of budget and team that most games require. And there are literally hundreds of self-published hobbyist games out there that went the same route that none of us will ever hear of: but all of their creators obviously thought their ideas were good, too.

__Most games that get made aren't really good enough to find an audience__  (fewer than 10% of games account for 90% of game sales). Minecraft found not just an audience but a community -- in large part because it was written in Java, and so accessible to a much wider range of modders than a better-performing, better engineered C++ engine would have been.

Even games with everything going for them -- great stories, proven mechanics, and experienced developers -- can __fall on their faces if they are rushed to market in an incomplete state__ (think _Assassins Creed Unity_ or _Halo: Master Chief Collection_  for a couple of notable recent examples) . 

The only way to be forgiven for those kinds of screwups is to give the audience something they can't get any other way. Minecraft clearly did that; in more conventional games the _Oblivion_  and _Fallout_ series both survived notoriously glitchy releases because their fans were willing to put up with the hassle in a genre that was underserved. But if people try to cash in on the later success of _Fallout 4_  and _Skyrim_  and the RPG market grows to the size of the FPS market the audiences will be much pickier.

In general, it's easier for lousy software to sink a great idea than for a great idea to rescue shoddy workmanship. The number of truly awesome, radical ideas isn't very big -- but the number of ways you can sabotage a decent idea with crappy design, poor art, or buggy software is infinite. The ratio, therefore, justifies they cynicism even if there are handful of exceptions.
