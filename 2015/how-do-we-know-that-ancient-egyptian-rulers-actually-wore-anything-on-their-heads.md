The headcloth (the _[nemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemes)_ ) is attested in zillions of statues and reliefs which aren't supposed to depict the deceased. A few examples:

You can usually identify subjects who are already dead in Egyptian art by the arms crossed over the chest in the 'Osiris pose' -- and often a dead subject is depicted with legs fused together into a mummy-like column. So there are plenty of depictions of non-funerary headgear. 

Plus, they even put it on depictions of non-funerary gods, like this very alive-and-kicking [Sobek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobek)
