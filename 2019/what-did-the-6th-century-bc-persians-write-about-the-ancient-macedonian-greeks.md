We have very poor sources from Persia in that period— certainly nothing that reflects the opinions of ordinary Persians. The only (likely) mentions of Macedonians in the handful of Persian sources are a few inscriptions which mention the conquest of the _Yaunâ takabarâ_  — “the shield-hat-wearing Ionians”.

The Persians tended to use “Yauna” — their version of Iones, or Ionians — for all Greek-speaking people (they don’t distinguish by dialect or ethnic group). Some historians assume the “shield hat” is a reference to the Macedonian beret, the _[kausia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kausia)_ _,_ others think it’s the regular Greek sun-hat, the _[petasos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petasos)_ . The Macedonians wore both kinds of hat, but the latter was not unique to them; the _petasos_ was common to Greek cavalrymen so it would apply equally to Macedonians and, say, Thessalians. It was very frequently used in depictions of Hermes. The petasos usually came with a chin-strap, but the kausia did not. The best preserved Persian source appears to show a chin strap.

_This coin shows a possible Yaunâ takabarâ in a_ petasos _but it’s not Macedonian. It comes from Lesbos — a Greek island that was also conquered in the 6th c. Note the chin strap._

The best reason to assume that _Yaunâ takabarâ_  are specifically Macedonians is that they generally appear in Persian sources listed near the satrapy of [Skudra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skudra). Descriptions of people from Skudra correspond well to Thracians, so it’s plausible that Skudra=Thrace and thus their _Yaunâ takabarâ_ neighbors are Macedonians. It’s a reasonable guess, though not incontrovertible.

In any event the mentions are extremely scanty — they basically record that the _Yaunâ takabarâ_ were conquered, paid tribute or supplied soldiers for the Great King’s armies. This fits with the traditional view that Macedon was a Persian vassal state from the 510’s down until the defeat of Xerxes’ invasion of Greece in 480.
