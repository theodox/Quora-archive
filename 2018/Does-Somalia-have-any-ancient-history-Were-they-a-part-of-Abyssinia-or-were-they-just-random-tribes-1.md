Unfortunately there is not a lot of written info before the 10th century or so.

However, the region was well known as a center of trade in spices (especially cinnamon and frankincense) and ivory all the way back to the time of the Pharaohs.. There is a [school of thought](http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-africa/somalia-ancient-lost-kingdom-punt-finally-found-006893) that identifies Somalia as the [Land of Punt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Punt), which the ancient Egyptians regarded as a far-off exotic trade destination (there are alternate candidates too, but the vagueness in the Egyptian sources forces us to guess). The first recorded contact with Egypt is very old, dating to the 5th dynasty — about 4500 years ago. The high point of Egyptian-Puntian trade was the famous expedition of Egyptian queen [Hatshepsut](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/hatshepsut), in 1493 BC.

The trade seems to have continued on prosperously for another four centuries. At [Opone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opone) (modern [Hafun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafun)) archeologists have found traces of pottery from Mycenaean Greece that must have been trans-shipped by Egyptian or Arab traders — a long voyage which indicates the value of the products Puntland had to trade. However, the [Bronze Age collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse) tore up the international trading networks of the Middle East — after about 1100 BC there are no more concrete records of contacts between Egypt and Punt. A couple of centuries later “Punt” (or more precisely _Pwenet_ ) had become more or less a legend, like El Dorado or Atlantis.

Despite the interruption, trade in spices and ivory was still a powerful attraction, though, and eventually new visitors came in search of those valuable commodities. After the Greek conquest of Egypt (in 332 BC) , the new rulers began to look to opportunities further south.

On the military side, they were [desperate to find a supply of elephants for their armies,](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-historical-fact-you-know-off-the-top-of-your-head/answer/Steve-Theodore?share=3532e59f&srid=zLvM) since their arch-rivals in the Seleucid empire controlled the supply of Indian elephants. They established trading posts up and down the Red Sea coast in order to organize elephant hunts — in Greek the “Horn of Africa” was known as _oros elephas, “mount Elephant.”_ 

More important, though, was the civilian trade in incense. Frankincense and myrrh, in particular, were prized luxury commodities in Greece, Mesopotamia and the Middle East. By the first century BC however there were several coastal cities or city-states which where known trading destinations for Greek and Arab sailors. The [Periplus of the Erythraean Sea,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periplus_of_the_Erythraean_Sea) basically a sailors manual from the first century, lists a number of cities in what’s now Somalia and details the commodities there. [Opone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opone), [Malao,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malao) [Bulhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulhar) and [Essina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essina) were the prominent stops.

The spice trade flourished for the next several centuries, with traders from Greece and Rome, India and Arabia visiting the region. Unfortunately we don’t know much about the political history of this time. The Ethiopian kingdom of [Axum ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum)was the biggest power in the region from the third to the eighth centuries, but as far as we know the Axumites never subjugated most of modern Somalia. Arabian states were their main competitors — before the rise of Islam the Axumite empire occupied parts of southwestern Arabia.

At the same time Arab kingdoms, particularly from Yemen, were trying to monopolize the trading ports along the east coast of Africa, as far south as modern Tanzania. Our evidence for this is still mostly Greek and Roman but it suggests that the Arabs did not control the ports around the Horn of Africa, only those farther south. That might mean that the cities or city-states of Somalia were powerful enough to retain their independence — or it might just be a quirk of the evidence.
