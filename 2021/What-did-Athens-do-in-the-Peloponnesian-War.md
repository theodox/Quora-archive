Lose.

Ok, not _quite_  fair, but that’s the TLDR. The war lasted an entire generation (431–404 BC) and included several years of “cold war” (roughly 421–413) in the middle.

To a first approximation, the Athenian strategy was to “turtle”: to avoid an open-field confrontation with Spartan forces, using the [Long Walls of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Walls) and a superior navy to control the seas and hit isolated Spartan weak points. The Spartan strategy, at first, was the converse: to keep Athens penned up by regular invasions of Attica and to use superior land forces to compel Athenian allies to switch side.

Unfortunately for the Athenians, keeping the entire population of Attica safe inside the Long Walls created the perfect conditions for infections disease; the crowded city was devastated by [a serious plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Athens) (probably typhus, 430–427). This reduced the initial Athenian advantages and also hit hard at the older generation of political leadership, most notably killing the cautious, far-sighted [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles) and unleashing a more radical version of the city’s democracy led by overconfident demagogic politicians like [Cleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleon).

The first round of the war ended in 421 essentially in a draw: Athens was still suffering the aftereffects of the plague, but naval raids and in particular the unconventional Athenian victory at [Sphacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sphacteria) had put a dent in Sparta’s reputation for invincibility. Athens remained the dominant sea-power and Sparta was supreme on land; both were licking their wounds.

Over the next several years there were a number of proxy conflicts — one of the side effects was that the power-political conflict between Athens and Sparta took on ideological overtones between aristocratic and democratic forces throughout the Greek world, leading to a lot of [horrific civil wars ](https://www.uvm.edu/~bsaylor/classics/corcyra.html)and the rapid erosion of political honor and self-restraint.

The low point, for Athens, came in 415 when Athens mounted a massive invasion of Syracuse in Sicily. The original proponent of the war, the unscrupulous but charismatic [Alcibiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades), was removed from command and replaced by his chief opponent, a doveish conservative who opposed the plan and who was known for his unimaginative style on the battlefield. The Spartans intervened to help the defenders, and the second or “[Decelean](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/peloponnesian-war/decelean-war/)” phase of the war began. The overextended Athenian forces — a long way from home facing a rich opponent with a first rate navy — suffered a disastrous defeat which also devastated the cream of the Athenian fleet, setting the stage for a very different conflict.

In the last phase of the war the Spartans allied with the Persians, who feared the Athenian presence on their shores and who had learned how to exploit Greece’s perennial internal strife to their own advantage. The Persians provided abundant money, and the Spartans were able to build and train a navy of their own to challenge Athenian dominance on the seas. The Athenian empire — very restless since the rise of the populists had turned Athenian “protection” into a naked protection racket — was rife with rebellion. Still crowded behind the Long Walls, the Athenian population depended on grain shipped from Thrace and the Black Sea, so the loss of supremacy at sea meant starvation at home.

Sensing disaster, disgruntled aristocrats overthrew the democracy in 411, hoping that a more aristocratic regime might be able to make terms with the Persians using Alcibiades as an intermediary. The heavily democratic navy and the population of the Pieraeus however, could not be brought round and the democratic rule was restored within a year. Still, the combination of internal disunion, a powerful Spartan navy commanding the seas, and the limitless financial support of Persia was unbeatable. After many dramatic reversals the Athenians were finally forced to surrender in 404: though the city walls remained intact (the Spartans were never very good at siege warfare) the combination of land and sea blockade had the city on the brink of starvation.

The Spartans mulled a plan — pushed primarily by Athen’s hostile neighbor Thebes and her great commercial rival Corinth — to depopulate the city. However they also knew that in the pile-on-the-leader style of politics which defined classical Greece they’d sooner or later need an ally against Thebes and/or Corinth, and spared the city. They installed a [nasty oligarchical regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Tyrants#:~:text=The%20Thirty%20Tyrants%20(Ancient%20Greek,Peloponnesian%20War%20in%20404%20BCE.&text=They%20became%20known%20as%20the,their%20cruel%20and%20oppressive%20tactics.) which engaged in a reign of terror that alienated almost the whole of the city’s population; a band of naval veterans led by [Thrasybulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrasybulus) restored the democracy after about year.
