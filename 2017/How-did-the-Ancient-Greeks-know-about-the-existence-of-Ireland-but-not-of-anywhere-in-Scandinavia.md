Our sources for Greek knowledge of northern Europe in the period when Greek cartography started mapping out the world are not good. It was [difficult for Greeks to get there while Carthage ruled the western Mediterranean](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-right-that-the-Pillars-of-Hercules-marked-some-threat-to-navigation-in-the-Antique-era-which-is-why-navigators-of-Antiquity-didnt-colonize-the-Atlantic-coasts-of-Europe-and-Africa), so travel was rare and most of the knowledge filtering back to the Greeks was second hand, via Carthaginian traders. Prior to the Roman conquest of Gaul, the only known Greek traveler to visit northwest Europe is [Pytheas of Massilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pytheas), whose accounts were widely disbelieved — often for things we know he got correct, such as the [existence of sea ice](https://www.quora.com/Can-someone-identify-a-particular-Ancient-Greek-word-in-this-text-by-Strabo), the midnight sun, and amber washing up on Baltic beaches. Pytheas’ book survives only in fragments preserved by later writers, most of whom remained pretty skeptical of what he had to say. He did, however circumnavigate Great Britain about two generations before Eratosthenes; his numbers, while not great, are presumably those which Eratosthenes used.

The map in the question details is a modern reconstruction based on a written account in Eratosthenes. His maps (and the later, more famous one by Claudius Ptolemy in the Roman era) were[ very dependent on reports coming back from travelers](https://www.quora.com/If-the-ancient-Romans-were-at-least-nominally-aware-of-the-existence-of-China-and-India-why-did-Roman-maps-tend-to-stop-at-Mesopotamia/answer/Steve-Theodore), so there was no data to work from in areas where talkative ship captains did not venture. Eratosthenes was active more than a century before the Roman defeat of Carthage cleared the way for Greeks and Romans to explore the Atlantic world; Pytheas will have been his only source for anything beyond the pillars of Hercules.

In the Roman period there was still relatively little detailed knowledge of North Sea or Baltic sea coasts — these were dangerous areas outside of Roman control, and trading there was less profitable and predictable than other routes. There was some, but nothing like the dense network of observations that made for fairly good maps in the Mediterranean and to a lesser degree the Indian Ocean.

This map shows the distribution of the “sample points” that Ptolemy (in the first century AD) was working with for his map.

Lots of great details in the source of that image, here: [Ptolemy's Geography](http://members.casema.nl/h.vandeukeren/histotron/ptol_index.htm)
