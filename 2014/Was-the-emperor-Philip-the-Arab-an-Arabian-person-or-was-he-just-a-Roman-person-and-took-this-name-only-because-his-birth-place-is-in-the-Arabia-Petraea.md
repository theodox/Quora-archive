He was of "Syrian" extraction, although at that date that probably means he was of ultimately Punic / Phoenician origin -- before the rise of Islam, "Arab" was used for a much more narrow geographic range, centered on the Arabian peninsula : nobody in the 3rd century would have called Egypt an "Arab" country back then. It's also not clear if the cognomen _Arabus_  was one of the official kind, which was approved of and used by the family itself, or merely a descriptive one applied by others, but I'd be willing to bet this is an informal cognomen -- the family itself is not otherwise distinguished and their connection to the traditional Roman elite is distant. His home language was more likely [Aramaic ](http://cal1.cn.huc.edu/aramaic_language.html) rather than Arabic.

Philip's full title (from coinage, etc) is _Marcus Julius Philippus,_ which suggests two things. First, the _Julius_ suggests that the family gained Roman citizenship under a Julio-Claudian emperor or perhaps Julius Caesar - it's common to take the name of a powerful Roman patron as your Romanized family name. The _Phillipus_  suggests that the family was Hellenized, probably during the heyday of the [Seleucid Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire), since it's a Greek rather than a Roman name. The _Marcus_  might harken back to [Septimius Severus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus), who himself tried to portray himself as an inheritor of Marcus Aurelius. Philip married [Marcia Otacilia Severa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcia_Otacilia_Severa) and so had may have had some legitimate connection to the Severan dynasty.

The Severus connection is interesting also because the [Severan dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severan_dynasty) had close links to Syria: Septimius Severus himself seems to have been of Punic descent on his mother's side, and both [Elagabalus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus) and [Alexander Severus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Severus) were born in Syria. Elegalabus at least was very publicly devoted to Syrian religious traditions. One could speculate that there was a Punic or Semitic interest group which both the Severans and Phillipus benefitted from - but that's just a speculation.
