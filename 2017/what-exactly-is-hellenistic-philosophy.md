You can’t answer this with an _exactly_ , unless you want something like this:

__Hellenistic philosophy refers to the variety of philosophies propounded in the Greek-speaking world between about the time of Alexander the Great and the time of Roman emperor Justinian__ .

In round numbers, that’s the 800 years from 325 BC to 525 AD.

Hellenistic is a modern coinage that’s used to describe the Greek world after Alexander’s empire (and its successor states in Macedonia, Syria and Egypt) eclipsed the power and cultural prestige of the Greek city states; it’s conventional to distinguish between “Classical” philosophy, which runs from pre-history up through Plato, Aristotle and their contemporaries from “Hellenistic” philosophy which is everything that comes after. Since the term covers such a huge range of time and the beliefs of many competing philosophical schools it is extremely vague.

For a very crude summary you could identify five major Hellenistic “schools” or tendencies. Many individual thinkers borrowed bits and pieces from more than one of these sets of ideas. Most of them still have updated, modern versions.

__[Cynics](http://www.iep.utm.edu/cynics/)__ taught that the pursuit of individual virtue was the most important aspect of life. They tended to emphasize ascetic rejection of luxury, excess and pride (one of the most important early Cynics, Diogenes, was visited by Alexander the Great. When Alexander — the most powerful man in the world — asked Diogenes what he wanted, Diogenes, who was enjoying a bit of sunbathing, replied “I want you to step out of my sun.” Alexander laughed and said he that if he weren’t Alexander, he’d be Diogenes. With their anti-materialist and anti-authoritarian attitudes Cynics are sometimes compared to beatniks or early hippies.

__[Stoics](http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicism/)__ emphasized rational self-control. They believed that by aligning one’s personal outlook with the laws of reason (and thus, the laws of the universe which they saw as ultimately rational), one could be free from both intellectual confusion and emotional distress. In many ways Stoic reserve resembles the Buddhist ideal of detachment. Stoic ethics taught taught duty and self-denial, and had a large impact on both the ideology of the Roman empire and later on Christianity.

__[Skeptics](http://www.iep.utm.edu/skepanci/)__ emphasized the difficulty of attaining certainty both in practical and metaphysical terms. They sometimes claimed that nothing could be known with certainty; the most they would generally commit to was that some views were more probable than others. Skeptics were influential in the elaboration of formal logic and rhetoric.

__[Epicureans](http://www.iep.utm.edu/epicur/)__ believed in a materialist view of the universe, seeing it as nothing but “atoms and the void”. They looked for mechanical explanations of natural phenomena, argued against divine intervention in human affairs, and believed that “the good” was purely physical pleasure and freedom from distress; the only criterion for morality was a calculation of long-term self interest (ie: you don’t refrain from rape because rape is wrong — only because the benefits to you don’t outweigh the likely consequences).

__[Neo-Platonists](http://www.iep.utm.edu/neoplato/)__ ____ emphasized the parts of Plato’s thinking which distinguished an ‘inner’ reality from the visible realities of the world around us. They emphasized the role of universal concepts in perception: they saw a basic concept like “triangle” as pre-existing and informing the reality of an actual triangle which might be drawn poorly, cut out of warped wood, or merely discussed in words. From that basic idea they derived the follow-on idea of different gradations of reality from a true, eternal core outwards to the changeable, chaotic world of ordinary life.
