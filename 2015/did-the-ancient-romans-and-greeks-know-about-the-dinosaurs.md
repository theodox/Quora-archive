As has been noted in the other answers, the dragon myths (Cadmus and the founding of Thebes, the dragons that guarded the Hesperides and the Golden Fleece, etc) could originate in fossil stories, but it's also possible that they are second hand. Greek myths received a lot of influences from Mesopotamian and Egyptian culture so these stories may not really be Greek originals (Cadmus, for example, is traditionally a Phoenician; the Golden Fleece is in Colchis, on the far side of Asia Minor).

There's an interesting hypothesis that the myth of the cyclops -- a giant, brutal humanoid with a single eye in the middle of its face -- derived from fossil finds like this mastodon skull:

Xenophanes of Kos found fossil seashells on mountaintops and deduced that the mountains had once been underwater.

The usual Greek response to a fossil find was to interpret it in light of mythology. So, for example, when a set of giant bones showed up near Sigeion in Asia Minor, they were believed to be the remains of the Homeric hero Ajax who was renowned for his size (the kneecaps they found were six inches across, which suggests the bones belong to a mastodon). The Greek traveler [Pausanias ](https://www.strangescience.net/pausanias.htm)records a few examples of this kind of find in various parts of the Greek world.

There's a great fictional account in Harry Turtledove's [The Gryphon's Skull.](http://amzn.to/1AVoa0P)
