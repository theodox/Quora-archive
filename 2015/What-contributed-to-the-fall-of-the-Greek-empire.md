To be clear, there was never really a "Greek Empire". If Greek history has a single dominant theme, it's disunity: the Greeks were never welded into a single political entity except when they were conquered by the Romans (or later, by the Turks).

__The Macedonian Empire(s)__ 

The closest candidate for a 'Greek Empire' in most people's minds is the empire of Alexander the Great -- who himself was not a Greek, but a Macedonian. His career illustrates exactly why the Greeks never united. Strictly speaking most of Greece wasn't even part of Alexander's domain (cities like Athens and Sparta were unwilling and resentful "allies" of Alexander -- nominally independent but too afraid to dissent from his plans).

Alexander defeated the Persians in 331 BC and spent the next five years pacifying the remnants of their empire. His campaigns led him as far as the Indus river, but his army refused to follow him further east. Even while he lived he was threatened by several plots and conspiracies. Some of his Macedonian followers didn't like the honor and generosity he bestowed on his new Persian subjects. Some of his Greek followers didn't like the influence of the Macedonians, who they thought of as half-civilized. And of course many Persians wanted to overthrow him and regain their lost power. Alexander's life was threatened on several occasions and he ended up becoming increasingly paranoid, executing many close associates and old followers.

When he died -- probably of natural causes -- in 323. Almost immediately it became obvious that the "empire" was nothing but Alexander's personal possession: there was no legal or political framework holding it together without his outsized personality. Within four years the empire began to fragment as Alexander's top generals. the old Persian nobility, and the various city-states of Greece began to stake their claims. Alexander's heir and the rest of the royal family were murdered; the army fractured into factions, and the Greek states tried to regain their independence.

After a generation of continuous, confusing, multi-sided wars the situation stabilized with three big powers he [Seleucid Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire) and the [Ptolemaic Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom) squared off against the [kingdom of Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)).

For the next three centuries the Greek world continued to fight itself. The many city-states of southern Greece, the islands and Asia Minor tried to play the big powers off against one another while pursuing various feuds and vendettas against each other. Everyone paid lip service to the idea of Greek unity; common culture and common religion remained very strong. However in practical politics this meant next to nothing. Every city, state or kingdom was out for itself.

That total lack of national unity explains how the Romans -- less sophisticated and, initially, much less powerful than the Greek kingdoms --- were able to conquer and assimilate the entire Greek world in about 200 years ( see [Why were the Greeks unable to resist the invasion by the Romans?](https://www.quora.com/Why-were-the-Greeks-unable-to-resist-the-invasion-by-the-Romans)) .

__The Other Greek Empire__ 

Ironically that conquest created the other candidate for the title of "Greek Empire". The most successful Greek empire is the _Roman_  Empire: or more exactly the __Βασιλεία Ῥωμαίων,__ usually known in English as the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire).

In the 4th century the Romans began to divide their empire into two halves for better communication and more efficient military command (see [Why did the Roman Empire split up in 2?](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Roman-Empire-split-up-in-2) and [Was splitting the Roman Empire a good decision in hindsight?](https://www.quora.com/Was-splitting-the-Roman-Empire-a-good-decision-in-hindsight)) The western half of the empire -- roughly everything west of the Adriatic was largely dominated by the Latin language and by Roman culture. The majority of the people in the eastern half spoke Greek as a second language if not as their first. When the western empire collapsed in the 5th century the remaining, eastern empire was increasingly Greek in both language and culture: [Justinian I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I) (482-565) was the last "Roman" emperor who spoke Latin as his first language.

Unlike the earlier Greek states, the new Byzantine empire was relatively united. Although the Byzantines had their share of civil wars the constant pressure from outside rendered them less prone to faction-fighting than their Greek fore-bearers.

However it was the Greek-ness of the empire which also led to its dissolution; as the multi-ethnic Roman empire gradually transformed into a more homogenous Greek state, the allegiance of many regions -- particularly Egypt and Syria -- weakened. The Byzantines were less tolerant of cultural diversity and more willing to force their own Greek culture on the provinces. The ham-handedness of imperial efforts to unify the empire in one culture and one faith alienated many subjects, particularly in Egypt and Syria. Local resentments against the empire paved the way for the rise of Islam in the 7th century, a blow from which the Byzantines never recovered.

The other big weakness of the Byzantine state was related to conflict --- in this case not between cities or kingdoms, but between the imperial bureaucracy and powerful rural landowners. The balance of power swayed back and forth between the two groups throughout Byzantine history. Whenever the central government was at odds with the aristocrats who provided the money and manpower for the imperial armies, the Byzantines lost priceless territory.

The Byzantine empire was never as big as the united Roman empire at its height, and for the next 1,000 years it gradually shrank. Over the centuries the Byzantines were invaded by Arabs, Turks, Huns, Slavs, Goths, Magyars and eventually the French and Venetians -- just to name a few. In part, though, the length of that list is a tribute to how well the Byzantines did: not many empires last for a thousand years.
