No matter how much you are revered by your own people, history is pretty cruel in the long run. 

For the examples you mentioned:

__Alexander__  was buried in Alexandria -- already that was a violation, since his body was actually hijacked on its way back to Macedonia by Ptolemy, one of Alexander's warring successors, who wanted it as proof that he (rather than the other three main warlords of the day) was the real inheritor of Alexander's vision. 

 The body was originally buried in lavish golden sarcophagus, but within about 200 years the literally-and-figuratively worthless [Ptolemy IX ](http://www.armstrongeconomics.com/research/monetary-history-of-the-world/the-monetary-history-of-the-greek-world/egypt/by-ruler/ptolemy-ix-116-10688-80-bc)had Alexander disinterred and melted down the casket for gold. Alexander was re-buried in a glass sarcophagus, which was visited among others by Julius Caesar and Augustus after their respective conquests of Egypt. 

 [Caligula ](http://historical-hatred.tumblr.com/post/23686739792/list-of-crazy-things-caligula-did) stole Alexander's armor to play dress-up in. Late in his reign [Caracalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla) became obsessed with Alexander, and he took several items from the tomb including Alexander's tunic. Eventually the tomb was sealed by Septimius Severus (a Syrian himself, he may have had more of a historical sense than some other emperors) and eventually lost track of. It has never been found, though the odds that it has survived intact are very poor.

_It's not impossible -- though impossible to prove -- that the gold for this signet ring of Ptolemy IX's successor Ptolemy XI* came from Alexander's sarcophagus._ 



__Caesar's__  burial was highly unconventional: it was, in fact, basically [a serious riot](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/suetonius/suetonius-caesars-funeral/) involving political score-settling and arson. It was not, however, completely spontaneous: according to one account a wax statue of Caesar, mounted on a rotating mechanical platform, was displayed with realistic depictions of his wounds to whip up the sympathy of his supporters. Caesar was cremated, but his pyre was so laden down with offerings from the crowd that it would be impossible to extricate his remains from the rest. 

Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus -- known to us as emperor Augustus -- was Caesar's adopted heir and, once he achieved political preeminence in Rome, he proclaimed Caesar as a divinity and erected a temple in the Forum on the spot where Caesar's pyre had been. The temple housed a colossal statue of Caesar and famous artworks, and was decorated with the bronze rams taken from Antony and Cleopatra's ships at Actium. 

Caesar's temple survived into the middle ages. It was gradually stripped of its artworks (all lost) and its marble and bronze fixings; all that remains today is the concrete foundation. Most tourists pass it by without knowing what it is. It's not clear if the site actually contains Caesar's remains or not. It has been otherwise pretty thoroughly mapped.

_The glory that was Caesar._ 



The tomb of __Cyrus the Great__  is -- maybe -- the most intact of the ones in the question. It stood in the then-Persian capital of [Pasargadae.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasargadae) 

The building that has long been identified as the tomb is in very good shape (it had a very innovative design which made it resistant to earthquakes). 

In Greek accounts, the tomb contained a golden sarcophagus, along with rich clothing, golden ornaments, weapons and carpets. Alexander visited the tomb and found it had been desecrated and stripped of valuables. He was angry at the disrespect shown to a fellow monarch (kings have a vested interest in kingship, even that of their rivals) and ordered the hereditary caste of tomb guards put to torture for failure at their duties. He had the tomb restored and refurnished.

In the intervening centuries there is no further record of the tomb. The building identified today as [the tomb of Cyrus](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cyrus-v-tomb) lacks the inscription which is attested in two Greek sources, though it matches the general description. For most of the last several hundred years it was known locally not as Cyrus' tomb but as as _Mašhad-e Mādar-e Solaymān_  , "the tomb of the mother of Solomon".

 It's probably redundant to point out that there is no longer any golden sarcophagus or rich treasures, or even a body: the property rights of the dead have an expiration date.



As for __Alaric__ : his tomb has never been found because it was deliberately hidden by his followers, who took to heart the lessons they learned while plundering Italy. 

>  To this place [Consentia] came Alaric, king of the Visigoths, with the wealth of all Italy which he had taken as spoil, and from there, as we have said, he intended to cross over by way of Sicily to the quiet land of Africa. But since man is not free to do anything he wishes without the will of God, that dread strait sunk several of his ships and threw all into confusion. Alaric was cast down by his reverse and, while deliberating what he should do, was suddenly overtaken by an untimely death and departed from human cares. His people mourned for him with the utmost affection. Then turning from its course the river Busentus near the city of Consentia--for this stream flows with its wholesome waters from the foot of a mountain near that city--they led a band of captives into the midst of its bed to dig out a place for his grave. In the depths of this pit they buried Alaric, together with many treasures, and then turned the waters back into their channel. And that none might ever know the place, they put to death all the diggers.



_* Yes, Ptolemy XI succeeded Ptolemy IX, who co-ruled but outlasted his brother Ptolemy X. Ptolemy family history is really, really messy._
