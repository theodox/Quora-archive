It’s a throwback to the period from about the 7th through the 11th century when Eastern Europe was the primary source of forced labor for Europe and the Islamic world. The etymology is not just English — in French it’s _esclave_ , in Spanish _esclavo_ , _schiavo_  in Italian, _sklave_  in German and even _saqāliba_ in Arabic.

That said, I’d doubt there’s a strong connotation for most speakers of those languages. The historical connection is not something most people know or care about, and one doubts that most of the minority who actually do know the etymology are the kind of people who would use it with intent to offend. I think that most of the languages where this etymology holds, like English, have a separate word for present-day Slavs. I’d be willing to guess that far more English speakers would imagine a relationship between Slav and _slob_ , which sounds similar though it shares [no common ancestor at all](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=slob).

By the standards of modern language decorum, the usage is an anomaly: phrases with zero actual connection to anything half as bad can get you in trouble on any college campus in America. But that’s probably not a viable standard to use. The world is littered with these kinds of things; no language is free of them and no language will ever _be_  free of them, since no language community ever agrees on how to right all of the injustices of history. And — given how poorly we are doing these days on basic decency and politeness toward the living, the injustices of the tenth century aren’t going to be rectified any time soon.

I’d almost say that trying to right all these wrongs by reworking the language was Orwellian — but that’d be unfair to Orwell, who was a courageous advocate for honesty and plain speech over cant and doublethink, even though his name is now recycled as a synonym for both.
