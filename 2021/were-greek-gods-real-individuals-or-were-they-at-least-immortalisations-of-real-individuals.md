The theory that the gods were just distorted memories of real individuals is a very old one.

It is most famously associated with the 4th century BC writer [Euhemerus](https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/euhemerus-and-euhemerism). He was not really a historian, but rather a storyteller; his most famous story involved the ‘discovery’ of an island in the Indian Ocean which supposedly preserved the original, ‘non-mythologized’ story of Ouranos, Chronos, and Zeus as wise kings whom people came to worship as gods after their death.

It’s hard to know what, exactly, Euhemerus intended by his story; it might have been just light entertainment, it might have been a satirical fable, it might even have been a sideways swipe at the divine pretensions of Alexander the Great (Euhemerus’ patron was [Cassander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassander), who hated Alexander and [eventually murdered his sons](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-the-descendants-of-Alexander-the-Great/answer/Steve-Theodore)). Nevertheless the idea that the Olympian gods were mortals whose lives had been magnified by tradition became associated with his name — in modern scholarly literature this approach is known as “Euhemerism” even though we’re far from clear on what Euhemerus’ real views were.

_Although google says otherwise there are no clearly identified images of Euhemerus. This is_ _[Ennius](https://www.nndb.com/people/818/000095533/)_ _, a Roman poet, who adapted Euhemerus’ work into Latin._ 

In any case, Euhemerus was not the first person to consider this idea: it was common in Greek thinking for a few centuries before his era. To a large degree it’s implicit in the tradition of ancestor worship — an idea that was almost universal in Greece but was also common in many nearby cultures too. ‘Heroes’ (ἥρως in Greek) were always assumed to have lived as mortals but went on to acquire a kind of special status after death. Theseus or Heracles, for example, were firmly located in time (two generations before the Trojan war, assumed to have been historical) but they had temples and received sacrifices very similar to the conventional gods. The distinction was often pretty messy and complicated — you can see Herodotus [wrestling with this in the case of Heracles](http://oaks.nvg.org/heracles.html) and ultimately concluding that there were two, a ‘celestial’ one and a human one.

In any event, the idea that the Olympian gods might be distorted echoes of real people was a common, though not a majority in antiquity. For a good example., read [the chapter of the historian Diodorus of Sicily ( roughly a contemporary of Julius Caesar) discussing Dionysus](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html):

> Those mythographers, however, who represent the god as having a human form ascribe to him, with one accord, the discovery and cultivation of the vine and all the operations of the making of wine, although they disagree on whether there was a single Dionysus or several. Some, for instance, who assert that he who taught how to make wine and to gather "the fruits of the trees,"​ as they are called, he who led an army over all the inhabited world, and he who introduced the mysteries and rites and Bacchic revelries were one and the same person; but there are others, as I have said, who conceive that there were three persons, at separate periods, and to each of these they ascribe deeds which were peculiarly his own.

He goes on to describe three different human Dionysuses : an Indian king who invented wine and conquered territories in the east; an early culture hero who invented the plough; and a Theban prince who created a new religion.

One thing most ancient writers did agree on was that the origins of their traditions were… complicated. They recognized that the stories which pre-dated widespread literacy were complex and contradictory and difficult to piece together into a coherent whole. Sometimes they regarded these stories as highly coded allegories instead of literal accounts of divine doings. Sometimes they simply dismissed them as “fables of the poets” — essentially, as pop culture artifacts to be disdained by the enlightened. And, sometimes, they regarded them as dim echoes of a real historical past. The most common approach was to use all of the above according to taste — it’s not uncommon to see the same author use all of these techniques in different circumstances.

The boundaries between the human and the divine realms were almost always understood as porous — most families had a household shrine where they offered small sacrifices to their ancestors, a neighborhood ritual where they asked for favors from a local hero , and a round of ritual observances of the more well-known gods . A particularly popular or influential figure could become a “hero” and receive sacrifices and prayers from people who knew him or her while alive; [an exceptional figure (an Alexander or a Caesar) might even be acknowledged as a god](https://www.quora.com/When-the-Romans-deified-someone-what-was-the-theological-thinking-Did-they-think-they-could-make-someone-a-god/answer/Steve-Theodore) — at least in the eyes of some people — while still alive.

All of that contributed to a climate where the exact boundary between mortal and immortal was very porous and negotiable. A side effect of that is that the theological import of Euhemerism is also hard to pin down: for one reader a Euhemerized Zeus is no more divine than a living Alexander — for another, it means Alexander is no less divine than Zeus. Even fairly conventional thinkers acknowledged a range of options in the gradations of humanity and divinity.
