After about the 7th century Latin was basically a dead language in the East Roman Empire ([Justinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I) is usually regarded as the last emperor who spoke Latin as a native). There was enough 'Roman' flavor left in the Greek east that [at least one account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophylact_Simocatta) of [Heraclius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclius)' epic war with the Sassanians ( 602-628) compared the emperor to Scipio Africanus.

In general, though, the Latin side of the Roman heritage was desiccated. Byzantine literature tended to obsess over Greek antiquity -- any educated Byzantine would be expected to be familiar with Homer or Aristotle, but Cicero or Vergil would be known only to the most erudite. The [Suda](http://www.stoa.org/sol/), the biggest of the Byzantine encyclopedias, has this to say about Julius Caesar:



> The first who became monarch. He wrote a translation of Aratos' Phainomena and an Art of Grammar in Latin.


And Cicero:



> The orator.[1] There is material on him under the letter phi, in connection with Fulvia the wife of Antony. See under Fulvia.[2]


That does not mean the factual outlines of Roman history were lost. Among other sources there remained the Greek language histories of [Polybius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius) for the middle republic, [Diodorus Siculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus) for the late Republic, [Cassius Dio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassius_Dio) and [Ammianus Marcellinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammianus_Marcellinus) for the empire. However these matters were regarded as of antiquarian interest only: Augustus remained a point of reference, as the founder of the empire, as did some of the standout characters of early Roman history ([Hannibal's entry in the Suda](http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin//search.pl?login=&enlogin=&db=REAL&field=adlerhw_gr&searchstr=alpha,2452), for example, is far longer and more detailed than the two above -- since he was recorded in Polybius's Greek ) 

So: the information was probably available to antiquarians and humanists. During the periodic thaws in east-west relations you might see somebody like [Maximus Planudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximus_Planudes) translating Latin works into Greek for Byzantine readers) However the vital emotional connection had long since been cut: the Byzantines might proudly call themselves _Rhomaioi_ , Romans, but their feelings were engaged far more deeply with the Athens of Plato or the Alexandria of Callimachus than the Rome of Livy, Virgil and Cicero.
