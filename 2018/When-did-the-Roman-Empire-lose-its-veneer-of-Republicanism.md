The pretense wore thin pretty fast. You could reasonably say that the veneer died with Augustus, who devoted a lot of energy to maintaining the charade. One suspects this was part of what he meant with his deathbed words: _acta est fabula, plaudite! “The play is over. Applaud!”_ 

However, the language and public forms of Republicanism lingered for a long while. It was deeply baked into the the consciousness of the Roman elites — even though many ordinary people seem to have been frank monarchists as far back as the age of Caesar.

Rather than a single event, it’s better to see the disappearance of Republican consciousness as a slow process with a couple of significant milestones.

__January 24, 41 AD: Claudius__ 

By this point there had been a lot of craziness already: the reigns of Tiberius and Caligula had both degenerated into paranoia and secret-police repression. And a certain amount of political bloodletting had been part of the Republic since at least the days of Marius and Sulla. However both Tiberius and Caligula could, at least, claim to have been chosen for their positions by the Senate.

[Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius), on the other hand, was certainly nobody’s first choice — except that of the Praetorian Guards. He was not even a military coup leader - he was an amateur historian with a stammer and a limp.

When Caligula was assassinated, a group of senators and some of the city cohorts tried to pronounce a return to the Republican constitution. The praetorians — who had been the power behind the throne since the days of Tiberius — needed an emperor and they needed one fast: they found Claudius hiding behind a tapestry in the palace and carted him off to the Castra Praetoria to proclaim him emperor. The Republican rising fizzled in the face of political disunity and popular apathy — the crowds shouted that they wanted only one master. So Claudius ascended the throne and the point was made quite clearly: it was swords, not words, which awarded the throne. This was to be the central truth of Roman history for the next several centuries.

__71 : Vespasian and Priscus__ 

The military came out of its barracks again after the reign of Nero, which ended in the confusion of the [Year of the Four Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Four_Emperors), otherwise known as AD 69. The ultimate victor, Vespasian, started out with a show of deference for the Senate in the manner of Augustus and Tiberius. However within a couple of years the pretense was put to the test by the senator [Helvidius Priscus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvidius_Priscus)

A century of monarchy had made both sides aware of the role of political theater, and Priscus made a point of theatrical gestures which revealed the absolutist reality behind the legitimist facade. As the slave-philosopher [Epictetus](http://www.constitution.org/rom/epicdisc1.htm) records:

> when Vespasian sent and commanded [Priscus] not to go into the senate, he replied, "It is in your power not to allow me to be a member of the senate, but so long as I am, I must go in." "Well, go in then," says the emperor, "but say nothing." "Do not ask my opinion, and I will be silent." "But I must ask your opinion." "And I must say what I think right." "But if you do, I shall put you to death." "When then did I tell you that I am immortal? You will do your part, and I will do mine: it is your part to kill; it is mine to die, but not in fear: yours to banish me; mine to depart without sorrow."

Although Vespasian eventually had Priscus killed, he still preferred the Augustan ideal of fictional consent. He was far more tolerant of dissent than most of his predecessors, and the old forms survived even if many of the best plums were reserved for imperial relatives and hangers-on.

__81 : The accession of Domitian__ 

Vespasian had ensured the succession of his favorite son, Titus. However Titus’ early death elevated his second son, [Domitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domitian) to the throne in 81. Domitian had deeply autocratic instincts, and he ruled in open contempt of the senatorial class. The police-state apparatus that had surfaced under Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero reappeared, particularly as his reign wore on. Famously, he was the first emperor to openly use the title _dominus_ , which carried a strong overtone of “slave-owner” to Republican ears.

More important to the vestiges of the Republican legacy, Domitian was also a micro-manager who tried to control imperial affairs at a very detailed level through his own appointees, rather than leaving even mundane affairs in the hands of the old Senatorial offices. He laid the groundwork for the centralized imperial administrative state.

__96 - 180 — The Five Good Emperors__ 

However, when Domitian was assassinated in 96, the Senate reasserted itself — demonstrating that the old ideal still had some traction. They appointed one of their own, [Nerva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerva), as the new emperor and toppling Domitian’s statues all over the empire. The realities quickly reasserted themselves, however, as [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan) was elevated to be co-emperor by a Praetorian plot. Nevertheless Trajan was willing to play the Augustan game again, and the long respite of the [The Five Good Emperors](https://historyloversdelight.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/the-five-good-emperors-romes-golden-age/).

__193: The Year of the Five Emperors__ 

The second century is usually regarded as the zenith of the empire — for the most part the proprieties were observed between the Senate and the emperors, and the armies only fought against external enemies. However [Commodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus) — the good-for-nothing son of the philosopher-emperor [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius) — didn’t want to play by the old rules. He cared nothing for the Senate and only cared for the army as a prop to his personal glory, and which eventually descended into megalomania.

His unpopularity made him paranoid as well: finally, in 192, he planned to murder a large section of the aristocracy whom he believed were plotting against him. This led, in turn, to his actual assassination at the hands of his would-be victims.

It also led to to one of the most miserable episodes in Roman history — the [Year of the Five Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Five_Emperors). This chaotic spectacle featured not only the predictable civil war, but also the sorry spectacle of the empire literally being [sold at auction](https://www.unrv.com/decline-of-empire/didius-julianus.php) by the Praetorian guards (to [Didius Julianus, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didius_Julianus)for 25,000 sesterces per man).

The guardsmen didn’t get to enjoy their loot: they and their candidate were put down by the Danubian legions of [Septimius Severus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus) However the lesson was lost on no-one. Severus’ last words to his own sons were __"Work together, enrich the soldiers, scorn everybody else."__ 

The final epitaph of the Republic.
