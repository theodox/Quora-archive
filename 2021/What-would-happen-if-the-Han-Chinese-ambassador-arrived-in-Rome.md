He’d wish Augustus a happy reign:

> Even the rest of the nations of the world which were not subject to the imperial sway were sensible of its grandeur, and looked with reverence to the Roman people, the great conqueror of nations. Thus even Scythians and Sarmatians sent envoys to seek the friendship of Rome. Nay, the Seres came likewise, and the Indians who dwelt beneath the vertical sun, bringing presents of precious stones and pearls and elephants, but thinking all of less moment than the vastness of the journey which they had undertaken, and which they said had occupied four years. In truth it needed but to look at their complexion to see that they were people of another world than ours.

Here the “Seres” are from [Serica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serica), “the silk country” — which is to say, Chinese. This account was written about a hunded years after what it purports to describe; there’s not way to know if it’s based on an authentic record of a particular occasion or if it’s just a generic form of flattery intended to make Augustus look good.

Roughly around the time this was written an embassy _was_  sent west from China; however the it met with some discouragement from the Parthians and never made it to the Mediterranean.

> In the 9th year of Yung-yüan of Ho-ti [97 C.E.] the _tu-hu_  [governor] Pan Ch'ao sent Kan-ying as an ambassador to Ta-ts'in [Roman Syria], who arrived in T'iao-chih [Babylonia], on the coast of the great sea [Persian Gulf]. When about to take his passage across the sea, the sailors of the western frontier of Ar-hsi [Parthia] told Kan-ying: "The sea [Indian Ocean] is vast and great; with favorable winds it is possible to cross within three months---but if you meet slow winds, it may also take you two years. It is for this reason that those who go to sea take on board a supply of three years' provisions. There is something in the sea which is apt to make man home-sick, and several have thus lost their lives." When Kan-ying heard this, he stopped.
