Well one out of three, maybe.

“Promoter” by all means - Mussolini pinned a lot of his ideological agenda to the mantle of Roman greatness:

Even here the characteristic fecklessness of Mussolini’s regime often resulted in propaganda that did not inspire awe:

But the titles “protector” and “steward” are a lot harder to award to Mussolini.

His signature contribution to the form of modern Rome is the [Via dei Fori Imperiali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_dei_Fori_Imperiali)_[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_dei_Fori_Imperiali)_ __ a modern road which cuts straight through the heart of the ancient forum, and which was billed as a ‘modernization’ of the forum which was going to restore its Roman greatness. However most Roman archaeologists today bitterly resent the project.

_A map showing the route of the Via dell’ Impero (since renamed Via dei fori Imperiali). This shows how many structures had to be demolished in order to build the road — in addition to many medieval and renaissance sites, about 5000 people lost their homes to the project.

Many artifacts were simply carted off to storage without careful recording of their provenance or stratigraphy, meaning that it’s difficult or impossible to place them in proper context. The four-lane road which cuts straight through the boundary between the Republican forum, the forum of Augustus, and the forum of Trajan funneled a lot of traffic through a sensitive archaeological site, adding vibration and engine exhaust to the stresses on exposed masonry.

_This big boulevard with its marching legions was built right over the most important archaeological site in Rome. The road was built in only 11 months, leading to a chaotic, disorganized cataloging of important artifacts. There are still important excavations to be done under the roadway._ 

Hasty reconstructions were done on ideologically important structures like the [Curia Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curia_Julia); this often meant permanent changes to the buildings driven by political whims rather than scientific rigor. And of course Mussolini’s obsession with the Roman past meant that medieval and renaissance artifacts were slighted or even destroyed. The end result is one that leaves most archaeologists fuming.

This pattern was evident across many of the archaeological projects undertaken by the Mussolini’s antiquities department. Theatricality and propaganda mattered more to him than science (I once heard a curator describe the way Mussolini’s architects “restored” the [Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Grand_Master_of_the_Knights_of_Rhodes) as “_they turned it into a damned Italian bordello_ ”).

The one thing we have to thank Mussolini for in the archaeological field is familiar to anybody who has ever image-googled Roman topics: [Italo Gismondi’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo_Gismondi) “[Il plastico](http://www.museociviltaromana.it/en/collezioni/percorsi_per_sale/plastico_di_roma_imperiale)”, the vast 1:250 scale model of imperial Rome at the Museo della Civiltà Romana, was originally commissioned by Mussolini although it was not completed until the 1970’s.
