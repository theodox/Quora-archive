Obviously the inescapable difference is that half of the outer shell is just gone: the building was originally a complete oval, but only the northern half is still more or less complete today.

__Marble, not brick__ 

Apart from the missing pieces, the biggest problem in visualizing the original appearance of the Colosseum is the fact that it has been repeatedly stripped of its marble facades, leaving mostly the concrete, brick and masonry of the substructure to show us the shape but not the finish of the original building (this practice goes back a long way — even in 410 there were some areas where repair work had been carried out by reusing marble blocks from less visible parts of the amphitheater). Very little of the original marble facade remains, but you can see a few restored areas today:

Not all of the marble was white — the prestigious areas (such as the imperial viewing box and the first ring of seats, reserved for Senators) also used [imperial porphyry](http://www.imperialporphyry.com/history-of-imperial-porphyry/), a rare, precious and very hard purplish-red stone which was the most prestigious of all building material.

__The sand floor__ 

The floor of the Colosseum was, of course, rather different than it is today. Today’s ‘floor’ is actually the basement, a network of underground chambers and passages. In antiquity it had a wooden roof which was covered with sand most of the time (“arena” is simply the Latin word for “sand”).

__Statues and columns__ 

Another big visible change is also due to the re-use of Colosseum's building materials. If you visit today the amphitheater exhibits the utilitarian aesthetic of a modern sports stadium. In antiquity, though, the structure was liberally decorated with carved columns and statuary, giving it a much more “classical” ambiance. [This page](https://www.italyguides.it/en/lazio/rome/ancient-rome/colosseum) includes a neat cutaway view superimposing a reconstructed version of the original over the existing ruins — you’ll note that all of those many arches ringing the second and third tiers of the structure were filled with statues — all of which are now gone. This coin (from the reign of emperor Titus, when the Colosseum was still new) gives an ancient view of the same, with statues visible in the arches:

The top tier of the building was decorated with bronze “shields” (visible in the coin image as the round bits, alternating with the square windows). By 410 it’s likely that they were verdigrised and so greenish-gray rather than their original shiny metallic finish.

The coin also shows the lost quadriga: a large bronze statuary group of a 4-horse chariot and driver, which stood over the eastern entrance on a raised platform.

__The neighborhood__ 

Two other landmarks from the western side of the complex, both of which are now gone, were the [Colossus of Nero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_of_Nero), which gave the amphitheater its name, and the [Meta Sudans](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/Meta_Sudans/home.html), a conical fountain. The Colossus was a bronze statue, nearly 100 feet tall or roughly the size of the Statue of Liberty. It originally represented the unpopular emperor but was later reworked into an image of the sun god Sol.

In the 180’s another unhinged emperor, Commodus, replaced the original head with his own image, and reworked the statue to look more like Hercules — Commodus, a devotee of the gladiatorial shows in the amphitheater, also added an inscription proclaiming himself the “best of the gladiators.” We are sure that the colossus was still standing as late as 354, but there are no later mentions: it may have been destroyed in the sack of Rome in 410 or, more likely, during the more damaging sack by the Vandals in 455.* There are inscriptions inside the Colosseum from the 390’s and early 400’s which describe repairs to the structure following an earthquake so it’s also possible that the statue was toppled before 410.

_This northward-looking aerial photo from 1895 (!) shows the Meta Sudans (lower left, just above the Arch of Constantine) and the base of the colossus (the dark rectangle along the left edge of the picture). Both were removed by Mussolini during his rework of the area in the 1930’s. Photo c/o_ _[Roger Pearse](https://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/tag/colossus-of-nero/)_ 

__Awnings__ 

One last item that is missing from the modern Colosseum is the series of awnings which were erected to shade the visitors from the Italian sun. The rigging for these is visible in the coins above and also around the upper rim of the north side of the existing structure. However the details of the awnings — how they looked and worked — aren’t well known. We do know that in earlier times the awnings were worked by sailors, conscripted from the fleet at Misenum (near Naples). However the only discussions of this come from earlier sources — we can only assume that this was still being done in the 5th century but its possible that the practice was no longer going on.

__Shows__ 

Since the question specifies 410, there’s one very important thing to note that was _not_  going on in 410: gladiatorial combat. Emperor [Honorius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorius_(emperor)) banned gladiatorial shows in 404, at the urging of the church — the only worthwhile thing that feckless ruler ever did. The amphitheater still hosted animal hunts and musical performances, but there were no more mortal combats on the arena floor after 404.



_*As an aside: the disappearance of the Colossus is a great example of why arguments from silence don’t work in ancient history. Something the size of the Statue of Liberty, famous for hundreds of years, right in the middle of Rome just winks out of existence in the literary record with nary a trace._
