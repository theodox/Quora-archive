Julius Caesar’s son by Cleopatra, [Caesarion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarion), was nominally the last Ptolemaic pharaoh. His exact fate has been debated since antiquity — but general opinion, then and now, is that he was killed during the Roman takeover of Egypt. As Caesar’s biological son, he was a political threat to Octavian’s role as Caesar’s heir — this was more important than his role as a Ptolemy.

After the Romans arrived, the surviving Ptolemies were [Alexander Helios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Helios), [Cleopatra Selene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_Selene_II), and [Ptolemy Philadelphos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_Philadelphus_(son_of_Cleopatra)) — all children of Cleopatra and Marc Antony. There were not a lot of other royal Ptolemies floating around; the endless series of civil wars between Ptolemaic siblings had seen to that.

Since Antony’s children were Roman — in the eyes of public opinion, at least, if not exactly in law — the victorious Octavian treated them fairly carefully. They ranged in age from six to eleven years old, and when they were brought back to Rome the crowds reacted sympathetically to the sight of the children displayed as trophies in Octavian’s triumphal procession. The children were given to Octavian’s sister (Antony’s legal Roman wife) and she raised them as members of the extended imperial family, reprising the role of selfless Roman mother which she had played during Antony’s foreign dalliances.

There’s no record of the fate of the two boys, but this probably indicates death of natural causes rather than foul play. Later writers did not hesitate to condemn Octavian for the deaths of Caesarion and Antony’s eldest son, [Antyllus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Antonius_Antyllus) so a coverup here is unlikely.

Cleopatra Selene was married off to Octavian’s friend and ally, [Juba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II), the scholarly king of Numidia. Juba and Cleopatra ruled over the Numidian in what seemed to be a happy partnership. They made liberal use of Ptolemaic imagery on coins and inscriptions; they named their son [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_of_Mauretania). Ptolemy was educated at Rome and was close to Antony’s Roman daughter, [Antonia Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Minor), the mother of the future emperor Claudius. Ptolemy ran afoul of Caligula and was murdered, but his daughter Drusilla married into the [royal family of Emesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emesene_dynasty) in Syria; some centuries later, the ambitious queen [Zenobia of Palmyra](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-Zenobia/answer/Steve-Theodore) used this connection to paint herself as the heir of Cleopatra when she briefly conquered Egypt.

The fall of the Seleucid dynasty was a more complicated, and in many ways more abject. From 129 BC on a series of civil wars fractured the rump Seleucid state — now confined mostly to Syria and Cilicia — into a series of warring statelets. Restive local populations broke away in Judaea, Commagene, Tyre and elsewhere as various Seleucid claimants battled and betrayed each other. There were nine different claimants to the throne between 125 and 85 BC, a period so confusing that modern historians can’t really establish a solid chronology for it.

Things settled down under [Antiochus XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_XIII_Asiaticus), whose ancestry included both Seleucid kings and Ptolemaic queens (his mother was a different [Cleopatra Selene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_Selene_of_Syria), his grandmother, [Cleopatra Thea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_Thea)). But Antiochus’ state was a shambles, and was occupied by an invading Armenian army sometime between 78 and 72.

The Seleucid king was merely a bit player in the great power game between the Armenians, the kingdom of Pontus, and the Romans. The [Third Mithradatic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Mithridatic_War) of 73–63 brought Roman troops directly into the region in force. The eventual Roman victory saw Antiochus restored to his throne as a Roman “ally.” However his status was no better than that of a dozen Roman clients in the region; like them he was expected to keep the peace and toe the Roman line in foreign policy — and like them, if he proved troublesome or incompetent his kingdom would be turned into a Roman province without much of a fuss. He was no more or less interesting than the kings of Commage, of Emesa, of Nabatea, of Oshroene, or even of Judaea.

As it happened, Antiochus was not able to keep things quiet to Roman satisfaction. He was — in typical late Seleucid fashion — at odds with the people of his own capital and with a cousin, [Philip Philoromaeus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_Philoromaeus) A small civil war ensued, quickly settled by the forces of another Roman client, [Sampciseramus of Emesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emesene_dynasty#Sampsiceramus_I_to_Sampsiceramus_II). Philip replaced Antiochus, who was killed, but he himself proved no more able to look after Roman interests; in 64 Pompey annexed Syria as a directly administered Roman province.

This was more likely a matter of exasperation than ambition: the client network on the eastern frontier was far cheaper to maintain than direct control. The terminal fecklessness of the late Seleucids was a standing invitation to trouble from Parthia or Armenia. The dynasty was, at this point, such a parody of its former glory that the annexation was seen as little more than an administrative rationalization.

We’re not really sure what happened to Philip. The Ptolemaic queen [Berenice IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenice_IV) apparently had two suitors who were (or who claimed to be) heirs of the Seleucid dynasty. This implies that Philip was still alive, and possibly a [brother of Antiochus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_VII_Philometor) as well, in 55 BC. The unlucky winner (who bore the unfortunate nickname Κυβιοσάκτης, _“the salted fish salesman”)_ the queen’s hand only lived about six months — she had him killed — but she herself was killed by her own father, [Ptolemy XII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XII_Auletes), whom she had ousted and who returned with a Roman army to regain the kingdom.

Ptolemy XII is best known as the father of the Cleopatra VII, the Cleopatra of Caesar and Antony. Cleopatra herself would have been about 14 when her sister was executed. She herself would go on to fight wars against her brother ([Ptolemy XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsinoe_IV)) and her sister ([Arsinoe IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsinoe_IV)) and to poison another brother ([Ptolemy XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XIV_Philopator)).

Given the performance of the last generations of both Hellenistic kingdoms, the Romans didn’t expend a lot of worry about dynastic loyalties and patriotic revanchism among the former subjects of the Ptolemies and Seleucids. Cleopatra excepted, these were not among history’s more formidable royals.
