The one sentence answer is "we don't have a clue". Although, to be more exact we have a lot of clues -- just not enough evidence to really put them together into a coherent picture. 

The name "Sea Peoples" and the prime textual evidence for the Sea Peoples comes from Rameses III's funerary temple at [Medinet Habu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medinet_Habu_(temple)). The temple includes a typically bombastic Egyptian record of Rameses' accomplishments, centering on his defeat of the Sea Peoples at the [Battle of the Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Delta) in what we'd call 1175 BC or thereabouts. Here's a bit, just for flavor:

>  Those who reached my boundary, their seed is not; their heart and their soul are finished forever and ever. As for those who had assembled before them on the sea, the full flame was in their front, before the river-mouths, and a wall of metal upon the shore surrounded them. They were dragged, overturned, and laid low upon the beach; slain and made heaps from stern to bow of their galleys, while all their things were cast upon the water. (Thus) I turned back the waters to remember Egypt; when they mention my name in their land, may it consume them, while I sit upon the throne of Harakhte, and the serpent-diadem is fixed upon my head, like Re.




The Medinet Habu inscriptions detail the course of the battle and also provide a rough kind of ethnography of the invaders. They list a bunch of peoples, most of whom are not otherwise attested. These have provided modern scholars with a lot of opportunities for guessing, but these are still guesses. The nations listed at Medinet Habu include:

__Peleset__ : usually identified with the biblical [Philistines ](http://www.britannica.com/topic/Philistine-people). Possibly Indo-Europeans related to the Greeks.

__Lukka__ : probably the [ Lycians](http://www.lycianturkey.com/lycian_history.htm), from southern Asia Minor.

__Ekwesh__ : Sometimes identified with Homer's [Achaeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaeans_(Homer)): ie, Mycenaean Greeks.

__Denyen__ : Sometimes identified with Homer's [Danaans](http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Danaans), that is, Greeks from Argos -- which, it should be added, was ([mythologically at least) an Egyptian colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danaus).) 

__Sherden__ : Usually assigned to [Sardinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia#Nuragic_civilization) 

__Shekelesh:__ Usually identified as [Sicels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicels) from Sicily.

__Teresh__ : Hypothetically the [Tyrrhenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrhenians) or Tyrsenians -- the Greek name for the earlier inhabitants of northwest Asia Minor and, in their view, the ancestors of the Etruscans.

__Tjeker:__  Even the guessers have a hard time with this one; suggestions include Homer's Teucrians and Cretans from [Zakros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakros). They seem to have settled down in the city of [Tel Dor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Dor) in Israel.

In other contexts some of the same people are seen working with the __Libu__ , who are firmly identified with the Libyans.



As you can see that's a big, diverse group with not much in common. The association is even more problematic when you consider the arc of destruction which led up to the battle of the Delta. The arrows on this map give the misleading impression of a vast military operation, which is not correct; but the general spread of destruction clockwise around the eastern shores of the Mediterranean is right.

Which of course make you wonder how all those Sicilians and Sardinians ended up fighting the Hittites. It's conceivable that these groups all originated (as this map suggests) in western Asia minor and ended up in the far west later -- but its equally conceivable that we're grasping at vague similarities in names. 

 The pictorial evidence from Medinet Habu is very vivid and includes some suggestive detail. This Sherden:

certainly looks like he's wearing something along the lines of this authentically Sardinian helmet:

 but a similar headgear shows up in Hittite sources (here, with a plume):

So it's hard to be sure. Meanwhile the feathered bucket helmer on this Tjekker



![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eb94e058c027afcaa958eee6493cacf7-c)

Doesn't have an obvious analog outside Egyptian sources. 



So, the minimalist guess would be that they are from southwestern Asia Minor and consist mostly of peoples we don't know from other sources with some admixture of identifiable Mycenaeans and Lycians. The maximalist guess is a grand, pan-Mediterranean pirate coalition involving the semi-civilized warriors of every sea-faring people from Sardinia to Lebanon. I think the former more likely but this isn't a settled question.
