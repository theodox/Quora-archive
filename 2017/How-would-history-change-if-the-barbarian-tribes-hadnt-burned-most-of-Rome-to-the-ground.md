Actually Rome was never burned to the ground. The city was sacked twice, in 410 and again in 455. In neither case was the attack intended to totally destroy the city; the attackers were after portable wealth and to a lesser degree slaves — actually going out of their way to destroy the place wasn’t on their agenda. (There’s more details in [What were the sackings of Rome in the year 410 by the Goths and Vandals like? Were they organized or did they just ride through the city slashing, burning and pillaging?](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging))

The real decline of the city had to do with the capture of Roman Africa by the Vandals, which started in 435 and lasted for exactly a century. Rome was extremely dependent on imported grain from Africa; with those supplies in enemy hands there was no choice but to disperse the population. By the time the Vandals lands were reconquered in 535, Rome’s population has shrunk to something like 50,000 people — where it stayed until the 17th century.

The physical decay of Rome owes a lot more to a thousand years of people picking it over as a vast open-air quarry and pit mine: marble was burned to make quicklime, iron and lead clamps holding masonry together were scavenged, and valuable bronze fittings or statuary were melted down for reuse.

Of course the larger question is “what would have happened differently if Rome hadn’t been conquered”. My suspicion is “probably not so much.” The process by which military and political power left “Romans” and transferred to “Barbarians” was a very long and complex one. By 476 there had only been one Roman emperor in the previous 300 years of purely Roman origin — the most common homeland for Roman emperors was modern Serbia (where the Roman army was headquartered). A large fraction of armies which fought against Rome in 410 had fought for Rome only 10 years earlier. [Alaric,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_I) the Gothic warlord who first captured Rome, actually bore the Roman army title of _magister militum_  — basically “5 star general”. Flavius Stilicho, who was the main obstacle to Alaric in the early 400’s, was half Vandal. And when the Roman armies defeated Attila the Hun in 451 — the last great Roman victory in the west — the core of their army was a Visigothic contingent led by [Theodoric I: ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodoric_I)Alaric’s son.*

In the next century as “Roman” power weakened in the west the new “Barbarian” kingdoms adopted Roman law and many Roman practices. Old Roman families intermarried with the newcomers (the old Roman aristocracy also tended to flock to the Church, where their literacy and traditions were more appreciated than in the courts of warrior kings). There were real changes — particularly at the upper end of the social scale — but there was a lot of continuity as well. The long term trends that created the Middle Ages — population decline, de-urbanisation, and the breakup of the large Roman trading bloc into smaller and smaller local units — had been going on for at least a couple of hundred years when Rome was finally rendered irrrelevant.

Another victory, a few different colors on the map would not really make that too different… After all, East Rome (the “Byzantine Empire”) had another 1,000 years of life ahead of it when the Goths were looting the forum, and it still displayed many “medieval” features too.



*The story of Theoderic’s “barbarian” alliance with Rome is the ultimate inspiration for the alliance between Rohan and Gondor in _Lord of the Rings_ , btw.
