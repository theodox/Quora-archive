# What happened to the rest of the Romans after the Roman Empire fell, and why didn't anyone gather the rest of the Romans and try to rebuild?

The short answer is they did what they could, but the situation was not recoverable. Rome wasn't swamped in invading barbarians (see [What were the sackings of Rome in the year 410 by the Goths and Vandals like? Were they organized or did they just ride through the city slashing, burning and pillaging?](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging)) 

As the other answers note, the eastern half of the empire survived and tried to reconquer the west under Justinian (see [Why was the Eastern Roman Empire never able to take back the territory to its west after the Western Roman Empire fell?](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Eastern-Roman-Empire-never-able-to-take-back-the-territory-to-its-west-after-the-Western-Roman-Empire-fell) for more details).

Parts of Italy and Sicily remained under Byzantine control until the 11th century. 

The real problem was the loss of the richest parts of the eastern Empire to the Arabs in the 600's. This put the Byzantines on the permanent strategic defensive: not only did they have to worry about their own survival, the old Mediterranean world on which the Roman empire thrived was forever split into mutually hostile camps. In the heyday of the empire it was easier and cheaper to get from Rome to Alexandria, Antioch or Jerusalem than to go to Lutetia (Paris) or Vindobona (Vienna); the whole economic and political structure of antiquity was based on the sea. Once the southern shore of the Mediterranean was in the hands of an arch-enemy the "Roman" world could never be put back together.

On the other hand, the dream of unity died hard. Charlemagne, re-united much of the western empire and assumed the title of Roman emperor in 800. He may look to us like a "Medieval" king but he was very self-conscious about being the heir of the Caesars:

_Karolus Imperator Augustus: Charlemagne = Caesar._ 

Charlemagne's empire did not include the old Roman provinces of Spain but it did include almost all of Gaul, Italy north of Rome, and the old frontier provinces of Rhaetia and Noricum. It carried on its business in Latin, it busied itself with the preservation of classical literature. Charlemagne himself was a Frank -- but Rome had non-Roman emperors as early as Trajan in the year 98. It was a ramshackle business compared to the heyday of Rome (though, by the end of his reign Gaul in particular had recovered its population to levels not seen in 400 years) but it was a powerful testament to the long shadow cast by the idea of a united "Roman" world.

Charlemagne's "Holy Roman Empire" lasted, in attenuated form, until 1806.
