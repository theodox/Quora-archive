Suetonius gives a detailed — if maybe not otherwise testable — rundown of Caesar’s will in his [Life of Caesar, 83](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/suetonius/12caesars/julius*.html):

> at the request of his father-in‑law, Lucius Piso, the will was unsealed and read in Antony's house, which Caesar had made on the preceding Ides of September at his place near Lavicum, and put in the care of the chief of the Vestals. Quintus Tubero states that from his first consulship until the beginning of the civil war it was his wont to write down Gnaeus Pompeius as his heir, and to read this to the assembled soldiers. In his last will, however, he named three heirs, his sisters' grandsons, Gaius Octavius, to three-fourths of his estate, and Lucius Pinarius and Quintus Pedius to share the remainder. At the end of the will, too, he adopted Gaius Octavius into his family and gave him his name. He named several of his assassins among the guardians of his son, in case one should be born to him, and Decimus Brutus even among his heirs in the second degree.​ To the people he left his gardens near the Tiber for their common use and three hundred sesterces to each man.

There was some surprise at the time that the choice didn’t fall on Antony. After the will was public, he found various ways to avoid paying Octavian what he was due — this remained a point of conflict between them until they finally joined forces after [Mutina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mutina)
