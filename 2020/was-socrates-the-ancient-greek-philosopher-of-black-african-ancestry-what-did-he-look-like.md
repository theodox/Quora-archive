It’s quite unlikely, based on what we know.

Socrates was born in 470 BC, give or take a couple of years. His family came from the suburb of Alopece, outside the city walls of Athens. We know that his family had to have all been Athenian citizens for three generations: the [very restrictive citizenship law](https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/characters/pericles_p5.html#:~:text=In%20451%20Pericles%20introduced%20a,mother%20becoming%20a%20full%20citizen.&text=The%20relationship%20scandalized%20polite%20society,action%20for%20most%20Greek%20men.) of 451 limited citizenship to people who could prove that all four grandparents were also Athenian citizens. Since neither Socrates nor his father lost their citizenship at that time, all of his great-grandparents must have been Athenians. The family must have been relatively well off, though not wealthy: during his military service Socrates served as a hoplite, which required providing your own suit of armor, an expense that was out of reach for the working class.

It is very unlikely that some of those great-grandparents themselves were of African descent. We don’t have anything even approximating statistics for the ethnic background of Athenians during this era, but the city’s official self-image emphasized the idea that the city was [“autocthonous,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autochthon_(ancient_Greece)) that is, that the Athenians were native to Attica and not wandering immigrants like their arch-enemies, the Dorians of Thebes and Sparta. Here’s something Plato puts into Socrates’ mouth in the dialogue Menexenus which sums it up:

> So firmly-rooted and so sound is the noble and liberal character of our city, and endowed also with such a hatred of the barbarian, because we are pure-blooded Greeks, unadulterated by barbarian stock. For there cohabit with us none of the type of Pelops, or Cadmus, or Aegyptus or Danaus, and numerous others of the kind, who are naturally barbarians though nominally Greeks; but our people are pure Greeks and not a barbarian blend; whence it comes that our city is imbued with a whole-hearted hatred of alien races.

[Menexenus 245](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DMenex.%3Apage%3D245)

It’s worth pointing out that Socrates is actually _parodying_  the official Athenian way of talking here: though he speaks these words in the dialogue, he says that he’s quoting them from Pericles’ mistress [Aspasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspasia).* Nonethless, this illustrates how xenophobic 5th century Athens was — and how unlikely it would be for a controversial figure like Socrates not to attract criticism should his neighbors not regard him as a “real” Athenian. [Accusations of foreign ancestry were a common kind of political slander in Athens](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D3%3Asection%3D172) — but, as far as we know, nobody ever leveled that charge at Socrates, even when he was on trial for his “un-Athenian” way of life.

As it happens, Socrates’ contemporaries did comment on his appearance, though it never occurred to them to mention his complexion. The mentioned his snubbed nose and bulging eyes and frankly described him as “no beauty.” Most commonly, however, they likened him to traditional depictions of the satyr [Silenus](https://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Seilenos.html), who was usually depicted with a snub nose:

> [Socrate] is likest to the Silenus-figures that sit in the statuaries' shops; those, I mean, which our craftsmen make with pipes or flutes in their hands: when their two halves are pulled open, they are found to contain images of gods. And I further suggest that he resembles the satyr Marsyas. Now, as to your likeness, Socrates, to these in figure, I do not suppose even you yourself will dispute it; but I have next to tell you that you are like them in every other respect.

_Plato,_ _[Symposium 215](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DSym.%3Asection%3D215b)_ 

Xenophon also used the Silenus connection:

> “As for the mouth,” said Critobulus, “I concede that point. For if it is created for the purpose of biting off food, you could bite off a far bigger mouthful than I could. And don't you think that your kiss is also the more tender because you have thick lips?”

> Socrates: “According to your argument, it would seem that I have a mouth more ugly even than an ass's. But do you not reckon it a proof of my superior beauty that the River Nymphs, goddesses as they are, bear as their offspring the Seileni, who resemble me more closely than they do you?”

[Xenophon, Symposium 5.7](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Xen.+Sym.+5.7&redirect=true)

Since this was an era before photography, that [verbal link to Silenus formed the basis for many later depictions of Socrates](https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3f59n8b0&chunk.id=d0e750&toc.id=&brand=ucpress), which are often very hard to tell apart from traditional images of Silenus. [Art historians divide Socrates imagery into two categories: “Type A” which references the traditional Silenus and a more idealized “Type B.”](http://www.stoa.org/demos/article_portraits@page=12&greekEncoding=UnicodeC.html)

One likely reason for the “African Socrates” theory is that there was a large subset of Silenus imagery that borrowed from the Egyptian god [Bes](https://www.livius.org/articles/religion/bes/), who played a similar role as a party-god. As Silenus and Bes overlapped, many depictions of Silenus adopted African facial features and sometimes an African complexion

However, there’s a second category of Socrates imagery, which is believed to derive from a statue made by[Lysippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysippos)s. These so-called “Type B” portraits are less exaggerated and less dependent on the traditional features of Silenus. These are less connected to the widespread Silenus tradition and are more self-consistent, though —thanks to the Greek fondness for idealization —they may not be entirely true to Socrates the individual either.

In short — it’s not hard to see why a modern observer might read an African phenotype into some of the traditional depictions of Socrates. However, for other reasons it’s extremely unlikely that a modern observer would have picked him out of a crowd in the Athenian street as ethnically distinct from his neighbors. Given his unpopularity during his lifetime, it’s pretty much certain that any hint of exotic origins would have been added to list of criticisms his opponents leveled against him.



* An index of the irony here is that Aspasia herself was not a citizen, and her children by Pericles were not eligible for citizenship. Pericles himself had to beg the assembly to grant citizenship to his own son, a public humiliation which he never lived down.
