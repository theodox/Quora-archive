He didn’t.

The library didn’t _exist_  during his lifetime. He founded Alexandria (note the name!) in 332 BC. The library was built by one his successors, [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter) (or, possibly by his son [Ptolemy II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_II_Philadelphus)) around 30 years after Alexander’s death.
