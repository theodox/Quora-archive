Carthage did OK for itself twice. From about 800 to 146 BC it was the biggest, most prosperous trading city in the western Mediterranean. Around 100 BC it was reborn as a Roman colony and eventually was the second largest, second richest city in the western Roman empire. It started to decay with the conquests of the Vandals in 435, which cut it off from the lucrative grain trade with Rome, and declined severely after the Arab conquest in the 600’s. It was basically abandoned by the 10th century, so it wasn’t making any progress in Europe or elsewhere.

The question sounds like you might be a victim of autocorrect. Are you thinking of [Catharism ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism)instead of _Carthage?_
