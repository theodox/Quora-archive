In Carthage, the highest elected officials were [suffetes (](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/suffete/)"shophet" in Punic). Similar terms were used in Phoenician city states. A very similar word in the Bible is usually translated as the 'judges' in the Book of Judges. 

Greeks usually used [strategos, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategos)literally "general" or "commander." There were also [archons ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon)although in most Greek cities that was more of a religious or judicial office than an executive one. 

Some Gallic nations (especially those which occupied important sites on valuable trade routs) had settlements with elected leaders, [vergobrets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vergobret)

Sumerians used [lugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugal) and [ens√≠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ens%C3%AD) for civic leaders, we're not sure exactly what the difference between those terms was and how often those were elective positions. Lugal is usually translated as 'king'.
