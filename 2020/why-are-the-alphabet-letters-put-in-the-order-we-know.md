Our alphabet has a complicated history, and passed through many different hands before assuming its familiar form. Here‚Äôs a simplified family tree:

Our Latin alphabet is ultimately __[a variant on the Greek alphabet](https://www.quora.com/Who-created-the-Koine-Greek-Writing-Why-was-it-written-more-like-Hieroglyphics-and-Demotic-than-its-mainland-Greece-dialectic-writing-Why-were-most-ancient-mainland-Greeks-not-able-to-read-Koine/answer/Steve-Theodore)__ ‚Äî it descends from the version of Greek writing that evolved on the island of Euboea around the 9th century BC and came to Italy with Greek colonists and traders.

The Greek alphabet was __[adapted from Phoenician traders](https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute/courses/greekpast/4739.html#:~:text=The%20Phoenician%20alphabet%20consists%20of,their%20alphabet%20more%20phonetically%20correct.)__  who dominated international shipping in the early Iron Age. The Greeks recalled this historical debt in the myth of [Cadmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmus), the legendary founder of Thebes, who was supposed to be a Phoenician.

The Phoenicians themselves __[inherited their letter forms from Egypt](https://omniglot.com/writing/protosinaitc.htm)__ , via the Egyptian colonies in the Sinai and Canaan. Most of our letter forms originated as hieroglyphs. Their names, however, derived from the words in Phoenician rather than Egyptian. This our __A__  is the Greek ___alpha___ and the Phoenician ___aleph;___ __ in Phoenician _aleph_ means ‚ÄúOx.‚Äù It‚Äôs the classic illustration for the evolution from picture-writing to abstract shapes.

_The evolution of the alphabet (or aleph-beth, where aleph means ‚Äúox‚Äù and beth is ‚Äúhouse‚Äù)_ 

However the ___ordering___ __of the alphabet comes not from Egypt or Phoenicia.__  It originated in the long-lost city of __[Ugarit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugarit)__ ____ (modern Ras Shamra, Syria) at the end of the Bronze Age.

Ugarit spoke a Semitic language related to ‚Äî but not ancestral to ‚Äî modern Hebrew and Arabic.

_This Ugaritic tablet looks like cuneiform but it‚Äôs actually alphabetic ‚Äî in fact, it‚Äôs an alphabet, written for practice around 3400 years ago. You can read it by comparison with the listing below. Photo:_ _[National Museum of Damascus, Syria](http://www.unesco.org/culture/museum-for-dialogue/item/en/94/alphabet-of-ugarit)_ 

Written Ugaritic looks like [cuneiform writing of Mesopotamia](https://www.quora.com/Is-cuneiform-an-alphabet/answer/Steve-Theodore) but the similarity only comes from the fact that both were written by imprinting symbols into clay using the end of a cut reed. In fact, the Ugaritic script is a consonantal alphabet or [abjad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#:~:text=An%20abjad%20(%2F%CB%88%C3%A6b,1990%20by%20Peter%20T.%20Daniels.), which uses about 30 characters to record the sounds of words by writing their consonants. The Ugaritic scribes organized their signs with a consistent sound order that is the ancestor of the alphabets of Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East. __Our alphabetic__ ___ordering___ __stems from the way the Phoenicians combined Egyptian letter forms and Ugaritic sound ordering to create their own alphabet__ .

_The Ugaritic ‚Äúalphabet‚Äù, circa 1300 BC._ 

The Ugaritic order is not _exactly the same as_ ours. They had no vowels* and they had to accommodate several consonants that we don‚Äôt have, like __≈°__  (= sh),__·π≠__  (= a hard ‚Äòt‚Äô, as in Hebrew) and __·∏´__ (a short of back-of-the throat ‚Äúh‚Äù). Our ‚ÄúG‚Äù and ‚ÄúC‚Äù both derive from the third sound, _gam_ in Phoenician ‚Äî in modern Greek the third letter of the alphabet is still _gamma_ .

So, despite the unfamiliar elements, it‚Äôs the Ugaritic order which is the ultimate origin of our ABCD. Here you can see how it was carried forward into Phoenician, Greek, and Latin. There are dozens of scripts which ultimately descend from Phoenician and they almost all retain recognizable variants of this ordering, despite additions and deletions to account for different sounds. Here‚Äôs an example showing the Phoenician alphabet in it‚Äôs native order juxtaposed against Latin and Greek:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f0db9f90721c29ad8534991e7feb0e28)

In the intervening millennia, most common for new symbols to be added at the end of the alphabet (you‚Äôll note the Greek additions in the table above all come at the end) which has kept the original Ugaritic order more or less intact for the last three millennia. The main disturbance in the order come from duplication (__C__  and __G__ , both children of __ê§Ç__ ) or divergences within Greek (the Italian flavor of Greek and then Latin used __X__  to write what the other versions of Greek wrote as __Œû__ and Phoenicians wrote as __ê§é.__ English speakers will be surprised to find __Z__ so early ‚Äî early Latin dropped it, then re-added it later to accommodate transliterated Greek words so it ended up at the end of the Latin alphabet. In modern Greek, however, it‚Äôs in the 6th position; Greek lost __œù__  in antiquity. Nevertheless the fundamental sequence is remarkably recognizable for a three thousand year old decision.

So ‚Äî the next time you scan an alphabetized list, spare a thought for the long-lost scribes of Ugarit and ponder how much time was saved by their simple invention down the last thirty-two centuries.



Bonus points: Strictly speaking Ugaritic scribes invented _two_ different orders ‚Äî the familiar one is for north Semitic languages, but there was also ___h l	·∏•	m	q	w	≈°	r	t	s	k	n	·∏´	b	≈õ	p	 æ	 ø	·∫ì	g	d	ƒ°	·π≠	z	·∏è	y	·πØ	·π£___ _,_ used for south Semitic languages. It lives on in the [Ge Ωez script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%CA%BDez_script), which is is used for a number of East-African languages.



_*Aleph in its ancient form was a soft glottal stop, like the pause between the two syllables in ‚Äòuh-oh‚Äô. The Greeks usually re-purposed Phoenician consonants as vowels, though they added_ _[omega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega)_ _, written Œ©, on their own._
