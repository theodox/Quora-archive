They are well attested as exotic imports in Roman times. The Romans generally picked up the habit from the Greeks, who started importing them around the time of Alexander the Great (Aristotle knew them as “the Persian bird”). Plutarch says that Plato’s stepfather [Pyrilampes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrilampes) kept peacocks, and used their exotic appeal to help his friend [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles) to seduce women.
