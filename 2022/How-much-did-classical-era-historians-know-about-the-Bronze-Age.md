We have a reasonable idea of what classical-era Greece knew about Mycenae. It's a decidedly mixed bag -- a combination of some remarkable survivals and some astonishing gaps. This is, alas, quite often the survival pattern for oral traditional histories. Classical era historians tried, as best they could, to fill in the gaps using information they knew was shaky and interpolated with “the lies of the poets.” Lacking archaeological evidence, however, they could only go so far.

To a first approximation, __the works of Homer exemplify what classical Greece knew__ — or failed to know — about the Bronze Age. There are a number of non-Homeric sources which are also derive from oral traditions with roots in the Bronze Age, but the Homeric corpus is the most illustrative (and by far the largest) example of what kinds of information was available to a historian in the age of Pericles and Herodotus. There were many ambiguous glimpses of the Bronze Age in other sources too: the intense localism of the Greek world produced a welter of local traditions with wildly varying levels of fidelity. However, for simplicity's sake it's easiest to stick with Homer, particularly because he loomed so large in the imagination of the classical era. While we're simplifying, we'll refer to Homer as if there's a single individual behind the name even though there are in fact [good reasons to put brackets around that idea.](https://qr.ae/pGjpyf (https://www.quora.com/What-Who-inspired-Homerus-in-the-main/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=16289005&share=29bd7d4b&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer))

__Some Truths__ 

To take the most well-known example of Bronze Age information that was widely known in the classical era, there are several important Bronze Age centers which feature prominently in the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey,_ despite being irrelevant or even uninhabited in the Classical era. Mycenae is the most obvious case: one of the great powers of the later Bronze Age, in archaic and classical Greece it was an insignificant farm town. Once mighty Mycenae -- Agamemnon's "Mycenae, the well-built citadel" that led a thousand ships to Troy -- sent a mere 80 hoplites to face the Persians at Plataea in 480.¹ Thucydides, however, knew that it had been a major power centuries before:

> Now Mycenae may have been a small place, and many of the towns of that age may appear comparatively insignificant, but no exact observer would therefore feel justified in rejecting the estimate given by the poets and by tradition of the magnitude of the armament.

> [1.10](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Thuc.+1.10&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200)

Likewise Homer (and the rest of the Greek oral tradition) remembered a time when Pylos, in the western Peloponnesus, was a Great Power even though in classical times, Pylos was basically uninhabited. That tradition was reflected in the habit (real or imaginary) of Athenian notables claiming descent from the house of Nestor: among the famous Athenians who wanted people to believe they were descended from Pylian royalty were Pericles and Plato.



_A 3-d flyby from the Demokritos University of Thrace gives a good idea of the physical layout of the citadel of Mycenae. It’s impressive but its somewhat stark appearance gives a decent impression of how little would have been visible to classical-era visitor — the visible remains are only the citadel, and don’t include the town which once surrounded it. Before 468 BC there were still functioning shrines, some of which may have been in continuous use all the way back to the Bronze Age, but these were destroyed and the site abandoned._ 

Homer also depicted a Greece that was divided up quite differently from the city-state world of the fifth century BC. He typically describes Greeks as “[Achaeans](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Achaean-people)”, never the "Hellenes" of the classical era. We've found letters from the chancery of the Bronze Age Hittite Empire sometimes denouncing, sometimes seeking alliance these [Ahhiyawa](https://archive.archaeology.org/0405/etc/troy3.html (https://archive.archaeology.org/0405/etc/troy3.html)). In the classical era, by contrast, Achaea was an underpopulated backwater region of the northern Peloponnessus,² living on in a haze of faded glory.

The oral tradition famously recalled the Trojan War as a central episode in the history of Greece. Only a little more than a century ago, modern historians dismissed that as a fable; but classical era historians [assumed that the Trojan War was historic](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-ancient-Greeks-and-or-Romans-view-the-Trojan-War-as-described-in-the-Iliad-as-an-actual-historical-event-When-did-it-come-to-be-seen-as-fictional/answer/Steve-Theodore). Their guesses were far from perfect — but they were closer than those of 19th century skeptics. Hittite records talk of fighting in “_[Wilusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilusa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilusa))_ ” widely seen as Homer's _Ilios._ They mention individuals like _[Piyama-Radu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyama-Radu)_ __ — that is, "Priam", — and _[Alaksandu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaksandu)_ _,_  "Alexander", Homer's alternate name for Paris. Nowadays the scholarly consensus strongly favors the ideas that traditions surrounding the Trojan War contain a solid nugget of Bronze Age reality. However that’s quite different from “proving” the historicity of Homer: Piyama-Radu and Alaksandu lived a century or so apart, and Piyama-Radu seems more like a pirate than a major king. The resonances are tantalizing but hardly constitute a slam-dunk proof of anything in the _Iliad_ .

A similarly ambiguous Bronze Age substrate is also visible in the epic view of Greece.

Homer's famous [catalogue of ships](https://ships.lib.virginia.edu/ (https://ships.lib.virginia.edu/)) in book 2 of the _Iliad_ lists dozens of cities and tribes. It more closely resemble settlement patterns of Bronze Age Greece than those of the days of Pericles or Plato. Contrariwise the Dorians and the Ionians, the two most important ethno-linguistic groups of the classical era, are barely detectable in the epics. Modern scholars treat this catalogue of ships with caution: it’s almost certainly picked up a few additions over the three or four centuries it was only preserved orally. Performing poets may have added shout-outs to their audiences, or dropped references to places whose identities were completely lost. Nonetheless it's a remarkable example of the tenacity of historical information, even somewhat dull information, in a vibrant oral tradition.

In fact, those oral traditions sometimes showcase the persistence of human memory in ways that border on the perverse. Since oral poetry relies heavily on meter as an aid to memorization, a particularly striking set of syllables can fossilize a historical factoid even when far more important facts are eclipsed. For example, Homer [preserves the authentic Mycenaean word for "bathtub"](https://www.academia.edu/30641266/The_Homeric_Asaminthos_Stirring_the_Waters_of_the_Mycenaean_Bath (https://www.academia.edu/30641266/The_Homeric_Asaminthos_Stirring_the_Waters_of_the_Mycenaean_Bath)) — ἀσάμινθος, “_asaminthos,”_ attested in tablets from Knossos — despite the fact that by about 700 BC the current words for tub were πῠ́ελος and λουτήρ.³ His use of the word even shows that the Mycenaean version was a big, step-in tub rather than the hip-baths that were more common later:

> αὐτὰρ ἐπεί σφιν κῦμα θαλάσσης , ἱδρῶ πολλὸν
νίψεν ἀπο χρωτὸς . καὶ ἀνέψυχθεν φίλον ῆτορ
ἔς ῥ' ἀσαμίνθους βάντες ἐϋξέστας .

> And when the waves of the sea washed the heavy sweat,
washed it from their skin and cooled their own hearts,
they entered the well-fashioned baths and bathed.

The chance survivals were not always as trivial: Homer also knows that the high kings of the Bronze Age used the title ϝάνακτς, _wanax_ . In classical times the word for king was βασιλεύς, _basileus_  — but in Homer, and in Mycenaean Linear B tablets the _basileus_  (in Mycenaean Greek, a _qa-si-re-u_ ) is a subordinate chieftain, not a sovereign. The later usage reflects the collapse of the old Mycenaean society: as the centralized palace-states of the late Bronze Age imploded, the surviving authorities were not the territorial _wanakes_  but local chieftains, just as in the aftermath of the Roman empire subordinate officers like _duces_  and _comites_  became rulers in their own rights as dukes and counts.

__Limits of transmission__ 

A classical era Greek studying the history of five centuries earlier did, indeed, have a good deal to work with thanks to Homer and the rest of the living oral culture of the time, particularly the many local traditions — noble genealogies, tales of city founders, and traditions of hero-worship — which supplemented the better known stories.

Unfortunately for the historian of Bronze Age Greece (now or two and half millennia back), oral tradition in general and the Homeric poems in particular are at best distorting mirrors. Historical memory is only one of the things an epic seeks to communicate. An epic is both a medium of information and a popular art form, so it's natural for dramatic or artistic concerns — or even just the demands of poetic meter — to crowd out historical accuracy. In Homer we see this in a variety of ways large and small.

To take a simple example, Homer's heroes (correctly) wield bronze weapons and wear bronze armor. But, tellingly, it's not uncommon to find iron tools in domestic scenes, particularly in similes drawn from peacetime imagery.

> τὴν μέν θ᾽ ἁρματοπηγὸς ἀνὴρ αἴθωνι __σιδήρῳ__ ἐξέταμ᾽, ὄφρα ἴτυν κάμψῃ περικαλλέϊ δίφρῳ:
ἣ μέν τ᾽ ἀζομένη κεῖται ποταμοῖο παρ᾽ ὄχθας.

The axes which Odysseus shoots through in the climax of the Odyssey are iron too:

> τὴν μέν θ᾽ ἁρματοπηγὸς ἀνὴρ αἴθωνι __σιδήρῳ__  ἐξέταμ᾽, ὄφρα ἴτυν κάμψῃ περικαλλέϊ δίφρῳ: ἣ μέν τ᾽ ἀζομένη κεῖται ποταμοῖο παρ᾽ ὄχθας.

The axes which Odysseus shoots through in the climax of the Odyssey are iron too:

> ... καί ῥ᾽ Εὔμαιον ἀνώγει, δῖον ὑφορβόν, 
τόξον μνηστήρεσσι θέμεν πολιόν τε __σίδηρον__ . 
δακρύσας δ᾽ Εὔμαιος ἐδέξατο καὶ κατέθηκε: 
κλαῖε δὲ βουκόλος ἄλλοθ᾽, ἐπεὶ ἴδε τόξον ἄνακτος.

> .... and she bid the divine swineherd, Eumaeus, 
to set before the suitors the bow and gray __iron__ . 
In tears Eumaeus took them and laid them down, 
and the cowherd wept elsewhere, when he saw his master's bow. 
[Odyssey, 21.80](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Odyssey21.php)

Archaeology, however, tells us this is wrong for the nominal time of the Trojan War (the most common guess in antiquity equates to what we'd call 1184 BC). The terms "Iron Age" and "Bronze Age" are oversimplifications; iron was known and used in Mycenaean times, but it was not common. What little we do find tends to be decorative — for example, iron rings or brooches — rather than practical. Iron tools and weapons doesn't become common in Greek archaeology until a couple of centuries after the fall of Mycenae. Clearly, the oral tradition recalled that bronze had been a key part of of the panoply of the heroes of old; but when it came time to make an analogy to daily life, iron seemed like a natural choice.

Taken alone, the anachronistic appearance of iron seems just a minor mistake of detail. Like Hollywood movie which opts for full plate armor in an era where the proper panoply is chainmail, it's a mistake which might infuriate one set of observers and be met with a shrug by others. However, it forms a near-perfect laboratory experiment showing the limits of oral transmission of historical memory. This example shows is the way that the needs of art can cut against the transmission of historical context.

As the poems were performed and re-performed down the generations, one of the rhapsodes must have chosen a homely image — a wheelwright felling a tree — in order to focus the audience's attention on the finality of the death of Simoeisius, who fell "like a poplar tree that grew in the bottom land of a great marsh." We can't be sure if the choice was calculated or a mere slip of the tongue. Perhaps the whole episode was inserted as fan-service for an audience which regarded Simoesius as a local hero and which had some local myth about poplars. Or, it's equally possible that _σιδήρῳ_ was easier to fit into the meter of a tricky line than some older, more obscure but more correct word and eventually replaced it. In the absence of other evidence we'll never know for sure how this anachronism crept in. We do know, however, that the forces which produced it are at work everywhere in Greek oral tradition, gradually silting over older layers of information.

That relentless accretion of time can still leave small details intact. Like a stray piece of statuary or a fallen column that hints at the presence of a lost temple, the oral tradition can preserve an authentic detail with striking immediacy. Homer describes [a strikingly improbable helmet made of boars' teeth](https://blogs.dickinson.edu/homer/2012/05/16/odysseus-boars-tusk-helmet-iliad-10-260-271/ (https://blogs.dickinson.edu/homer/2012/05/16/odysseus-boars-tusk-helmet-iliad-10-260-271/)); we've found more than 50 of them in Mycenaean-era graves. Yet complex, highly centralized and literate economy which enabled the production of those luxury helmets — the workshops and warehouses and bureaucracy which we know very well from the decipherment of Mycenaean records — leaves no trace in Homer at all.

Here, the context has been entirely consumed by the overgrowth. We may envision the proportions and stature of a vanished temple from its foundations and the handful of columns which we painstakingly restore on site. What's far harder for us to imagine is the street scene that surrounded the ruin: the mud-brick houses, the market stalls, the crowds and the draft animals and the trash — all the ephemera of the daily life which once surrounded today's gaunt, lonely monument.

So, for the Greeks of the classical era, the missing context was the sophisticated web of international trade and politics which linked Mycenaeans to the larger Mediterranean world in the Bronze Age. They might know about details of archaic weaponry or the genealogy of some royal house. But they didn’t know that the kings of _Ahhiyawa_  corresponded with the Hittites and traded with the Assyrians or that they swapped diplomatic niceties with Egypt (they also seem not to have been above a bit of piracy there, [a fact alluded to in the Odyssey](https://chs.harvard.edu/jeffrey-p-emanuel-cretan-lie-and-historical-truth-examining-odysseus-raid-on-egypt-in-its-late-bronze-age-context/ (https://chs.harvard.edu/jeffrey-p-emanuel-cretan-lie-and-historical-truth-examining-odysseus-raid-on-egypt-in-its-late-bronze-age-context/)). In the Homeric world these eminently prosaic contacts are reduced to a few [traveler's tales](https://chs.harvard.edu/curated-article/leonard-muellner-the-simile-of-the-cranes-and-pygmies-a-study-of-homeric-metaphor/ (https://chs.harvard.edu/curated-article/leonard-muellner-the-simile-of-the-cranes-and-pygmies-a-study-of-homeric-metaphor/)) and the appearance of exotic Trojan allies such as [Memnon the Ethiopian](http://>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memnon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memnon).⁴)).[⁴](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memnon).⁴) The poets do not sing of hauling ingots from Cyprus or selling sorghum in Sicily.

In the surviving Linear B records we can see fussy Mycenaean bureaucrats tracking the minutia of wool production and accounting for the number of broken chariot wheels in their arsenals. Careful staging of materials, the distribution of rations, and the centralized allocation of labor across large territories are all marked features of the characteristic Bronze Age "[Palace economy](https://ancient-world-project.nes.lsa.umich.edu/tltc/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BA_Shelmerdine_2008_Cambridge-Companion-to-the-Aegean-Bronze-Age_Economy-and-Administration-pp.-289-309-split.pdf (https://ancient-world-project.nes.lsa.umich.edu/tltc/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BA_Shelmerdine_2008_Cambridge-Companion-to-the-Aegean-Bronze-Age_Economy-and-Administration-pp.-289-309-split.pdf))." Homer's princes, by contrast, live a life of heroic swagger. They feast and distribute gifts with a gusto that would be instantly recognizable in the halls of Beowulf or of Valhalla. Their status is intimately tied to their open-handed largess, a reckless disregard of economy which quite far from the penny-pinching world of the Linear B records.

Modern scholarship generally sees the economy and society of the Homeric world as that of the Greek Dark Ages. The four or five centuries separating the fall of the Mycenaean palace-states and the emergence of familiar Greek cities produced a world that was mostly rural, highly localized, and beset by endemic small-scale violence. It's possible, even likely, that Homer's heroes bear the names of notables from the late Bronze Age⁵ but they behave like local warlords, not like the officers of a centralized state with a standing army.

To take the most obvious examples: Agamemnon leads by a mix of personal prestige, bluster, and bribery, not institutional power. Achilles doesn't have to worry about a court-martial if he sits out a battle in his tent. Both of them are intensely invested in their share of the army's loot in ways that modern readers find almost childish, but which made eminent sense in piratical world of the Greek Dark Ages. Their paramount concern was not money, it was their respective places in the heroic pecking order. Those places were defined by both conspicuous consumption and conspicuous distribution of wealth. This is why Agamemnon's behavior is so outrageous to Achilles: taking away his spear-won prize is a calculated insult intended to put a lower-ranking chieftain in his place (this is also why Agamemnon's later apology comes with such a blatant veneer of gifts: this visible award is intended to restore Achilles' rightful status).⁶

The fundamental flaw in the later Greek view of the Bronze Age was that lack of context; although Herodotus or Thucydides had a wealth of authentic Bronze Age facts to peruse they lacked the kind of information that doesn’t show up in the oral traditions which interested the warrior aristocrats of the Greek Dark Ages. The matrix of those striking details and remarkable survivals is, fundamentally, a different society: a rural world of warlords and pirates, not one of literate palace officials and centralized states. The totality of the transposition is reminiscent of medieval King Arthur tales which [enshrine a dim but authentic memory of the politics of the waning Roman empire in a context of courtly romances.](https://qr.ae/pvYe0t (https://www.quora.com/Was-Britain-s-Roman-history-reflected-anywhere-in-Arthurian-legends/answer/Steve-Theodore))

Later Greek writers were aware — often, despairingly so — of the slender threads which connected them to the history of what we would call the Bronze Age. Against that background Homer and other, less literary, oral traditions provided source material that could at least be made to seem plausible. Once historiography took off in the classical era, they mined the traditions available to them for material that could be fashioned into a plausible-sounding recreation free from what they called "the lies of the poets." Here, for example, is how Thucydides tried to understand the political context of the Trojan war using Homer and other oral traditions:

> Those Peloponnesians who possess the most accurate traditions say that originally Pelops gained his power by the great wealth which he brought with him from Asia into a poor country, whereby he was enabled, although a stranger, to give his name to the Peloponnesus; and that still greater fortune attended his descendants after the death of Eurystheus.... the Mycenaeans, dreading the Heraclidae, were ready to welcome [Pelops's son] Atreus, who was considered a powerful man and had ingratiated himself with the multitude. So he succeeded to the throne of Mycenae and the other dominions of Eurystheus. Thus the house of Pelops prevailed over that of Perseus.

> And it was, as I believe, because [Atreus's son] Agamemnon inherited this power and also because he was the greatest naval potentate of his time that he was able to assemble the expedition; and the other princes followed him, not from good-will, but from fear. Of the chiefs who came to Troy, he, if the witness of Homer be accepted, brought the greatest number of ships himself, besides supplying the Arcadians with them. In the "Handing down of the Sceptre" he is described as “_The king of many islands, and of all Argos._ ” [Iliad 2.108] But, living on the mainland, he could not have ruled over any except the adjacent islands (which would not be 'many') unless he had possessed a considerable navy.

[Thucydides 1.9](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+1.9&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0105 (http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+1.9&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0105))

The Greeks of the classical era assumed — not unreasonably, as we can see — that a bedrock of truth underlay the welter of stories they inherited from Homer and other oral traditions. They were certainly willing to rationalize away some of the miraculous elements but they believed that the web of interconnected names and genealogies were more than simple inventions. This may have been a guess, but it wasn’t a bad one: oral traditions don’t shine when it comes to economics but they are often quite good at family trees, particularly when the family trees happen to be those of the aristocratic clans who sponsor the oral performances.

Some of their reconstructions seem to hold up fairly well. It was quite common for modern scholars to dismiss them as mere mythology until the end of the 19th century. However the traditional date for the destruction of Troy — 1184 BC — was worked out from the network of heroic genealogies and dynastic myths. It’s not that bad a guess: the most recent book on the Bronze Age Collapse is titled __[1176: The Year Civilization Collapsed.](https://amzn.to/3yyrzIu)__ ____ The archaeology of the destruction of Troy VIIa lines up right between those two dates. On the other hand Homer gave them no clues to the intricate diplomatic and economic connections between Greece, Troy and the east that characterized the three or four centuries leading up to that war.

Ultimately the classical view of the Bronze Age was conditioned by that civilizational crisis. The death of the Bronze Age states of Greece severed many important threads of historical memory. Like the burning palaces which baked those Linear B tablets, preserving them for us, the dramatic events of the last generations of the Greek Bronze Age preserved some remarkable details for later Greeks (and us) to ponder: a few heroic deeds, the family trees of great names, some striking archaic details of dress and manner. But — like those baked clay tablets themselves — these details were buried beneath a tangled overgrowth that made it impossible to see the larger picture.

As a rule of thumb, you can multiply a Greek city's hoplite by fifteen or twenty to get a rough estimate of the citizen population -- which would make Mycenae at the time of Xerxes fewer than two thousand souls.
