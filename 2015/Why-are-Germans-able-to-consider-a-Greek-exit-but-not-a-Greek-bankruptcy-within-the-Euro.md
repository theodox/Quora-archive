An exit from the Eurozone could be spun as a form of punishment. Germans haven't enjoyed bailing out the Greeks so far, and having the Greeks repudiated their debts won't make them any more popular. There's also the macroeconomic case Greece could use deflation to make itself more competitive if it had its own currency.

A bankruptcy, on the other hand, will mean forgiving some portion of the debts. It's easy to spin that as a get-out-of-jail free card, which will be hard for German taxpayers to swallow. The negative consequences for Greece - like higher borrowing costs or loss of reputation - will be much less visible to non-Greeks than a humiliating expulsion from the Eurozone would be. "We're not willing to pay you back for the last loans, but you're still going to have 'loan' us more in the future" is a tough hand to play.

In any case I'd imagine that the whole thing is a negotiating position on the part of the German leadership. Greece says "we wan't more money, and we don't want to pay back what we've already borrowed" and Germany replies "If we kick you out of the Eurozone, everything you own will be be worth half as much the next day. You're better off just sticking with the current deal".
