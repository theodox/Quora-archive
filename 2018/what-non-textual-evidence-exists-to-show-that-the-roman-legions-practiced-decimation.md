I don’t believe there is any.

While decimation is well attested in the literary sources ([this answer](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-historical-evidence-of-Roman-legions-performing-decimation-of-their-troops/answer/Steve-Theodore) covers several examples, with references) it was not a common practice. Many of the attested examples attach to unpopular commanders who were terrible disciplinarians and who were also interested in administering a shock to an army that had suffered a serious defeat. It’s generally not a wise move, however: 10% casualties is a serious loss rate when fighting an enemy, and inflicting it on your own troops is at best a symptom of dire dysfunction. In real emergencies the Romans found other ways to shame a troublesome unit: for example, the survivors of Cannae were shunted off to garrison duty in Sicily, but they were not decimated.

In any case it’s hard to see what the physical remains of the practice would be. It was going to be done in the field, not in some kind of purpose-built facility and the weapons used would be no different than the ordinary weapons of Roman soldiers. It would be difficult to identify the remains of decimated soldiers independent of other kinds of battlefield casualties—at least in some cases the execution was done by bludgeoning rather than decapitations. There’s no textual record of what was done with the bodies, but the likeliest case would be cremation that would obscure anything distinctive about the burials.

There don’t appear to be any contemporary artistic depictions, though again that’s not surprising since decimation was associated with shame and defeat rather than the kinds of victorious exploits the Romans preferred to depict in their art.
