The universal tradition of antiquity is that Caesar wrote the Gallic Wars himself, but that [Aulus Hirtius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Hirtius) padded out the eighth book. Caesar also wrote the core of the Civil Wars, but Hirtius is believed to have written the parts concerning the campaign in Egypt and to have edited the books concerning Africa and Spain. In antiquity it was also suggested that the Hispanic War — which is much less polished than the other parts — was edited by [Gaius Oppius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Oppius).
