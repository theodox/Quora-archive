If you’ve ever visited the Museum of Natural History in New York, you’ve probably seen this:

It’s not a Seattle-area product, it comes from [Haida Gwaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Gwaii) — the former Queen Charlotte Islands, off the coast of British Columbia. Though it’s a [remarkable piece of craftsmanship](https://www.donsmaps.com/canoesnwc.html), it’s also a sinister one: the appearance of a vessel like this in the Puget Sound was like the appearance of a viking longship in the English Channel. It was an omen of war and of slavery.

Not many of us realize that__[the pre-contact Northwest had a major slave trade](https://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/WHQ/article/viewFile/5643/4717)__ . The Haida in particular were brilliant seamen and craftsmen — but they were also slavers who raided the coasts as far south as California in those big, beautiful canoes.* Captives were used to perform menial labor and sexual services for their new owners. They could also be traded — the Pacific Northwest slave trade extended at least from the mouth of the Columbia river up to Alaska.

Here in Seattle, local people were more often victims than victimizers. The [Lushootsheed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lushootseed)-speaking peoples of the Puget Sound were favorite targets for the Haida and the [Wakashan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakashan_languages)-speaking peoples of Vancouver Island in British Columbia. Lacking the more centralized social system of their northern and western neighbors, Puget Sound peoples were vulnerable to those big, ominous canoes.

However, it seems to have been military weakness relative to their western and northern neighbors and not raw virtue which limited slavery here. When opportunities arose, the local people participated too. Most Seattleites are familiar with this picture:

That’s [Chief Sealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Seattle), from whom our city gets its name (with a little help from poor transliteration). Not many of us know, however, that __the chief was a slave owner and a slave taker.__  He annihilated the [Chimakum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimakum#History) people in a war in 1847 — the few survivors were taken as slaves. Sealth/Seattle is revered as a wise leader who sought a peaceful accommodation with the Europeans who were just appearing in the region in his day — but his conversion to pacifism came later.**

So, while we’re busy [arguing about whose statues to take down](https://crosscut.com/2019/01/whitman-controversy-makes-its-way-olympia), we might need to add [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Seattle_(sculpture)) to the list:

* The canoe in the AMNH was done quite late in the 19th century, after the slaving era had come to an end.
** Seattle was apparently deeply disturbed by the death of his son in the Chimakum war. He converted to Roman Catholicism not long after the conclusion of the war, and that seems to have put a damper on his warlike urges.
