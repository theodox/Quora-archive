It depends on when you’re asking.

Until the Persian Wars, Ionian Greece was, in many way, wealthier and more sophisticated than mainland Greece. It was better connected to the trade and intellectual life of Mesopotamia and the Levant, and seems to have emerged from the Greek Dark Ages earlier and more self-confidently. If you look at a list of early Greek philosophers and writers, you’ll notice that most of them are Ionians: some standouts include

[Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus)

[Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander)

[Anaximenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximenes_of_Miletus)

[Hecataeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecataeus_of_Miletus)

[Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus)

[Xenophanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophanes)

[Leucippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucippus)

not to mention two really big names: [Herodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus) and [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod) (although Hesiod moved west to Euboea and lived there most of his life). For the same time period — from say 650 to 500 BC — Athens can really only boast the lawgiver [Solon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon) and the poet [Musaeus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musaeus_of_Athens)

Athen’s golden age was known to the Greeks as the _pentekontaetia_ , the “glorious 50 years” which started with the defeat of Xerxes’ invasion of Greece in 479 BC and lasted down to the end of the Peloponnesian war. Athens achieved its outsized reputation in Greek cultural and intellectual life only after the victories at Salamis and Plataea and after assuming the role of chief protector of the Greeks — and, not coincidentally, after acquiring a large overseas empire and a matchless position in control of international trade. It was the pride of victory, newfound wealth, and a huge overseas trading empire made Athens the “school of Hellas.”

This was not, however, an equally good time in Ionia. The whole reason that Athens was on the Persian hit list was Athenian support for the [Ionian Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Revolt) of 493 BC, in which the major cities of Ionia revolted against the Persians. The revolt did not succeed, and its failure is why Ionia Miletus, which had been the cultural and economic leader of Ionia, was destroyed with the survivors scattering all over the Greek world. In the other cities the reconquest was less bloody but still shocking — the Persians made a point of taking slaves from among the upper classes who had supported the revolt, so many noble families (the kind that filled the ranks of poets and philosophers) were extinguished.

So, by Herodotus’ day an aspiring author — particularly one who had good family reasons to dislike the Persian Empire, and to appreciate Athens’ stand on behalf of the Greeks — would end up in Athens as he himself did. But fifty years before the traffic was generally going the other way.
