For me personally, the classic in this genre is [The Siege of Wonder](https://amzn.to/2OxO20s) by Mark Geston — it’s not just a skim over the who-would-win stuff, it’s a really interesting philosophical musing on the nature of “disenchantment” in multiple senses of the word.

An interesting edge case is Gene Wolfe’s [Book of the Long Sun](https://amzn.to/2WuOtNo) series — it’s just SF, there’s no magic, but it’s written from the perspective of people who don’t understand the technology that shapes their lives; thus a conflict between AIs on a generation starship is told as a war between different gods.
