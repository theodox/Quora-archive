I don’t believe it’s attested, but Greek would be the logical choice.

Cleopatra was an [accomplished linguist](https://www.quora.com/Which-languages-were-commonly-used-during-the-Lagides-reign-in-Egypt) — but the sources say she spoke the languages of her subjects. Latin — as a tongue with no domestic utility and, in Greek eyes, no literature worth learning — would be an unlikely subject of study at least at first.

Antony, as a Roman aristocrat had the obligatory smattering of Greek schooling. Before meeting Cleopatra he spent time in Athens, where [Plutarch says](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html)

> he indulged his fondness for amusement by listening to literary discussions and by witnessing games and religious rites. In his judicial decisions also he was reasonable, and delighted to be called a Philhellene, and still more to be addressed as Philathenian, and he gave the city very many gifts.

So clearly he was comfortable in Greek.
