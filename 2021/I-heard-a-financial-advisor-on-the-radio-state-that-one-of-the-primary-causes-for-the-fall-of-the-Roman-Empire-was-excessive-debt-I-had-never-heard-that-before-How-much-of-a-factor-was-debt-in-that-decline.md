# I heard a financial advisor on the radio state that one of the primary causes for the fall of the Roman Empire was excessive debt. I had never heard that before. How much of a factor was debt in that decline?

That’s probably a very distorted third hand version of a common observation about the later Roman empire. However, it’s incorrect.

It’s widely known that the Roman financial system suffered a serious degradation after the second century. [This answer](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Roman-coins-decrease-in-value-during-the-A-D-200s/answer/Steve-Theodore) goes into more detail about the causes and effects, but the short version is simply that the Roman economy was based on finite precious metal reserves. The only way to expand the money supply was to substitute less valuable metals for gold and silver in the coinage. A Roman emperor could not simply “print money” — he had to recall old coins and remint them mixed with base metals, a move which was essentially a form of inflationary monetary policy. It was however also both inefficient and highly unpopular.*

_A sample of Roman coins over time, showing the debasement of the currency (this is not a truly scientific sample —_ _[it’s from one individual collection](https://www.reddit.com/r/ancientrome/comments/jv5sa8/roman_debasement_of_silver_a_graph_i_made_from/)_ _— but it gives a good idea of the trend)_ 

That tie to the physical stocks of gold and silver was the great weakness of Roman economics. It fact, it’s really the _absence_  of debt which really screwed up Roman imperial finances.

Because the imperial economy ran on precious metal coinage, there was no Roman equivalent to the government bond: the only way to finance a war or a new aqueduct was with cash on hand. This meant that a liquidity crisis was a crisis in everything else too: without a ready stock of physical coinage the government was hard put to field an army or fix a bridge. In the modern world a government can borrow against future revenues to make an investment by issuing debt — if done properly, the gains from the investment will pay for the cost of financing things and leave some little “profit” in the form of new infrastructure or victory in war. The Romans did not have that option : if you ran out of money you had to raise and collect new taxes, or perhaps seize the assets of some wealthy people. Neither of these was popular or easy to implement in a crisis.

In private business the Romans did have debt instruments — a businessman could borrow to finance a new building or a trading venture. [The Roman state, however, did not](https://www.quora.com/How-much-debt-did-the-Roman-Empire-have/answer/Steve-Theodore): it’s not clear whether this idea never occurred to them, or if it was regarded as an unsuitable display of neediness, or if coercing money was simply seen as more efficient. It might simply be that the prevailing interest rates were very high by our standards (12% was a fairly common rate in business loans, but 48% was not unheard-of) . The government could not generate the kind of revenue growth needed to pay back loans at that level.

The imperial government did avail itself of something like debt financing to save money on the cost of collecting and transporting large quantities of coinage. You may recall the existence of the “publicans” in the Bible, and how scandalous it was for Jesus to be willing to talk to them. The [publicani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publican) were essentially private bankers who provided the government with ready cash (back at Rome) and who were then deputized to collect the taxes in the provinces for themselves: if Judea owes Rome a million sesterces in tribute, a group of publicans will pay that million in cash at Rome and then collect it — plus a skim (frequently a very large one) for themselves — from the provincials. This was in some sense a kind of short term bond which covered the cost of shipping tons of metal overseas, with the publicans’ cut taking the place of interest. However it never generalized into anything a modern government would recognize as “sovereign debt”.

In the later empire, the financial system became more centralized and the publicans disappeared. The tax system became much more rational and efficient — but also much more demanding and intrusive. The endless wars against the Persians and the defense of the barbarian frontiers were incredibly expensive: the Roman economy is regarded as reaching its peak in the early second century, but the Roman army of the fifth century was much larger. The combination of constant defensive wars (which produced little loot), higher and more aggressive taxation, and efforts to assert central control over prices led to the rapid decline of the cash economy. Lack of cash undercut the ability of the government to respond to the external threats — which in turn, forced even higher taxes.

In a world where the central government is desperately hungry for gold and silver, growing your own vegetables and raising your own wool becomes a kind of tax haven. Large parts of the empire reorganized themselves for rural self-sufficiency, and money became increasingly scarce. If the crisis of the third century had been inflation (represented by the collapsing silver content of older coins) the crisis of the fifth century was deflation: a contracting money supply which introduced all sorts of inefficiencies into the way Romans paid for things. The Roman economy was much less debt-driven than our own, so the deflationary spiral was not fatal (the eastern Roman empire, of course managed to survive) but the perennial weakness of the late Roman state has a lot to do with the vicious cycle of deflation and de-monetization.

Thus, in the waning years of the empire in the west, the government’s main recourse for “financing” its most important obligations became, essentially, a reversion to barter. The late Empire frequently tried to pad out its armies with barbarian recruits. As the cash crisis lingered it became more and more common to “pay” these soldiers with grants of tax parcels, rather than coin. In theory the ownership of the land remained with the Roman state or its private owners and the new barbarian beneficiaries were simply collecting taxes which would once have gone to Rome as coin. In practice, however, the new class of landlords-cum-tax-collectors became the nucleus of what we’d recognize as feudalism: a system where highly localized taxation in kind in return for military service became the fundamental source of state power ([this answer ](https://www.quora.com/Is-this-how-feudalism-worked/answer/Steve-Theodore)covers the way this system evolved in post-Roman times).

So no: the Roman empire didn’t drown in debt. It starved for lack of cash, driven largely by perverse incentives but also to some degree by its complete inability to borrow against the future to meet the crises of the moment.

* The debasement of Roman silver coins in the second and third centuries slowed down in the later empire: Constantine and his successors generally had very high quality gold coinage, but the silver coins remained debased (only about 5% purity). There were efforts — not very successful — to move more and more commerce onto copper coins (the [nummi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nummus)) which was effectively a kind of fiat currency. For all its problems, the Roman empire of the 5th century had a more reliable currency system than that of the 2d, even though the economy overall was in decline.
