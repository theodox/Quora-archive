I’m not very up on the African scene, but I have seen evidence that it’s growing. There are a few entries in [www.gamedevmap.com.](https://www.gamedevmap.com/) [Legacy of the Kori-Odan](http://store.steampowered.com/app/368080/) was kickstarted a couple of years ago and is up on Steam. At GDC I briefly crossed paths with the guys who did [Desktop Dungeons](http://www.desktopdungeons.net/test/) , who are from Cape Town. [Rayman Fiesta Run](https://itunes.apple.com/app/rayman-fiesta-run/id657811530?mt=8) was done at Ubisoft Morocco.

I know I’ve answered questions from a couple of folks in Nigeria and SA online a couple of times, and there is an [igda chapter in Nigeria](https://igdanigeria.wordpress.com/) — so clearly some people are in the business — but it’s a tricky field to kickstart, particularly in such a big and challenging market. You should probably check out GamaSutra article on [The state of game development in Africa ](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/264888/The_state_of_game_development_in_Africa.php)for more on the ups and downs. There’s also this GDC talk on [The Emerging Landscape of African Game Development](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1018173/The-Emerging-Landscape-of-African) from 2013 — not sure if that’s paywalled or not.



_This is a trailer from_ _[Legacy of the Kori-Odan](http://store.steampowered.com/app/368080/)_ _, from Cameroon, which is available on Steam._ 

Given the distribution of hardware in Africa I’d expect that a lot of indigenous dev effort goes towards mobile or browser games: consoles are expensive, and PCs are pretty prone to piracy. Still it never pays to be too sure: the last mobile title I worked on had one login from Madagascar in the first 24 hours…
