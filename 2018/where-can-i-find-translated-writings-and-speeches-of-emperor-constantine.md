There is not a lot in Constantine’s own words — no speeches, no autobiographical material.

There are a a reasonable number official letters, usually quoted in the context of the the controversies between various parties in the church. [This page](http://www.constantinethegreatcoins.com/Constantine/Book1.html), [this one](http://www.constantinethegreatcoins.com/Constantine/Book3.html) and [this ](http://www.constantinethegreatcoins.com/Constantine/Book2.htmlhttp://www.constantinethegreatcoins.com/Constantine/Book2.html)collect most of them in translation. Most of them are quoted by [Eusebius of Caesarea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusebius) but that’s not the only source (the links have notes, a bit dated, regarding the sources at the end of each letter). There also a number letters quoted in [Athanasius of Alexandria’s writings about Arianism](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.xiii.i.html); the link lists the available letters but the site is, unfortunately, a bit tough to navigate (the ‘next’ button will sometimes go to what looks like a blank page — however you can hit ‘next’ again to move through the texts).

The other big source of Constantine’s own words are the large number of laws and edicts that are scattered across Roman law collections like the [Corpus Juris Civilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Juris_Civilis) and particularly the [Codex Theodosianus](https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Codex_Theod.htm). [This database search](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/history/query.cgi?search1=Constantinus+&sf1=Issuerrecorded&maxs=1&LawID=1&Codexorder=1&ARCPalingenesi=1&Titulus=1&CThKrueger=1&TitulusKr=1&Brev=1&CodexJustinianus=1&Citation=1&Excerpta=1&Doublet=1&Sibling=1&Join=1&Association=1&Correspondence=1&Issueractual=1&Issuerrecorded=1&Issuertheoretical=1&Addresseename=1&Addresseeidentity=1&Addresseeofficerecorded=1&Addresseeofficeexpected=1&Text=1&AuthorityCTh=1&Authorityother=1&Translation=1&BrevInterpr=1&SummAnt=1&OtherScholia=1&Datumrecorded=1&DatumMommsen=1&DatumSeeck=1&DatumBarnes=1&DatumOther=1&Datumpreferred=1&DatLocationrecorded=1&DatLocationexpected=1&AccLecPropositumrec=1&AccLecPropositumSeeck=1&AccLecPropositumpref=1&AccLecPropLocationrec=1&AccLecPropLocationexp=1&Conssrecorded=1&Consspreferred=1&Notes=1&sortby1=None&sortby2=None&sortby3=None&maxcolumn=44&database=laws2&maxs=1) collects all of the ones that are supposed to be Constantine’s (in some cases modern scholarship debates the authorship of individual ones — the individual entries include notes on each law regarding that) . Unfortunately most of the entries here are not translated, though some are. However you can use the reference number (CJ ####) to cross-reference against the English version of the Corpus Juris [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022718/http://www.freewebs.com/vitaphone1/history/justinianc.html) (for that matter, you can use the find function in your browser and look for “Constantine” on this page, since it’s all one huge web page). There does not seem to be a comprehensive English version of the Codex Theodosianus available online, unfortunately. This book: [The Justice of Constantine](https://www.amazon.com/Justice-Constantine-Communication-Control-Society-ebook/dp/B0100RBDC6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1528231442&sr=8-3&keywords=constantine+law)— with the usual extortionate markup for scholarly publishing, alas — looks at the sources pretty extensively.

You can get some sense of the themes that were publicly floated during Constantine’s reign from speeches 4, 5, 6 and 7 in the [Panegyrici Latini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panegyrici_Latini), translated into English as [In Praise of Later Roman Emperors](https://books.google.com/books?id=0WlC_UtU8M4C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ViewAPI#v=onepage&q&f=true). These are not by Constantine (and not all of them were even delivered when he was present) but as very public presentations they are good evidence for the ideas that were part of the court discourse of his reign.
