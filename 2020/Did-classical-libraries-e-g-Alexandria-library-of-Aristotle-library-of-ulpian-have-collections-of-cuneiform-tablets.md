There’s no record of Alexandria having tablets. There’s a good likelihood that non-Greek material existed only in translation.

The entire institutional history of the library is really quite obscure, despite the endless amount of ink spilled about it in modern times. The most relevant ancient source is the 4th century Christian writer [Epiphanius ](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/epiphanius_weights_03_text.htm)of Salamis, who put this speech into the mouth of an unnamed Librarian at the time of Ptolemy II, five and a half centuries before his own day:

> "There are already fifty-four thousand eight hundred books, more or less; but we have heard that there is a great multitude in the world, among the Cushites, the Indians, the Persians, the Elamites, the Babylonians, the Assyrians, and the Chaldeans, and among the Romans, the Phoenicians, the Syrians, and the Romans in Greece"----at that time called not Romans but Latins. "But there are also with those in Jerusalem and Judah the divine Scriptures of the prophets, which tell about God and the creation of the world and every other doctrine of general value. If, therefore, it seem good to your majesty, O king, that we send (and) secure them also, write to the teachers in Jerusalem and they will send them to you, that you may place these books also in this library, your grace."

He goes on to repeat [the traditional account of the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Aristeas), supposedly at the behest of Ptolemy II .

This isn’t exactly hard evidence: the folk-tale aspect is pretty obvious, and the story is clearly designed to lead up to the Bible translation as a capstone. It does, however, show that that the Library (some centuries gone in Epiphanius’ day) was believed to have included works from non-Greek sources.

The Babylonian, Assyrian and Chaldaean works in Epiphanius’ list would have come from the cuneiform tradition — but (if the example of the Bible is used as a model) they would have reached Alexandria in Greek translation, not in their original languages. The primary surviving example of a Near Eastern text making its way into the Greek work is the history of [Berossus,](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/berossus/) a Babylonian priest who wrote a history of Babylon in Greek, probably for Seleucid emperor Antiochus I.* The astronomer [Sudines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudines) was another Babylonian who wrote in Greek. There were almost certainly more authors who made Mesopotamian material available in Greek (for example, there are [a handful of just-perceptible traces of the Gilgamesh story ](https://www.quora.com/Were-there-any-surviving-records-of-the-Epic-of-Gilgamesh-before-archaeologists-found-it-on-baked-clay-tablets/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=01e79349&srid=zLvM)in Greco-Roman literature) but they weren’t common.

It’s worth pointing out that the Library never had _exclusive_  access to this kind of information. The Greco-Egyptian astronomer [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy), writing in the first century — thus, _after_ the destruction of the main library in 47 BC— clearly used a significant archive of Babylonian astronomical observations dating back hundreds of years. His [canon of kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_of_Kings) (which is a precious resource for Near Eastern chronology) is clearly based on Babylonian sources prior to and including the Seleucid era.** We know that Near Easterners continued to write about their own cultures for Greek audiences long after the Library’s demise: [Lucian of Samosata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian#:~:text=Lucian%20of%20Samosata%20(%20c.,and%20belief%20in%20the%20paranormal.), for example, was an ethnic Assyrian who explored some of the cultural cross-currents in Roman Syria in the second century.

Unfortunately we know even less about other libraries in the Greco-Roman world than we do about Alexandria’s. We do know, however, that many of these libraries began as individual collections, so they will have reflected the tastes and interests of individual collectors. We know for example that one collection in Naples included at least a few fossils (identified as “the tusks of the [Erymanthian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erymanthian_Boar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erymanthian_Boar)”))boar”) so its not _impossible_  that a few tablets existed as curiosities. However given the very scanty traces of cuneiform in Greek and Roman literature — I don’t think there an explicit description of writing on clay or the distinctive character forms in any classical source — it’s unlikely. There was a lively interest in Babylonian or Chaldaean culture (faux-Mesopotamian trappings were as important to Roman astrologers and fortunetellers and faux-Asian trappings are to their modern inheritors) but it’s probably likelier that any archival material that was picked up by collectors was on fragile, short-lived papyrus…. more’s the pity.



* Berossus stands in about the same relationship to the Seleucids that [Manetho ](http://www.ancient-egypt.org/who-is-who/m/manetho.html)— the Egyptian priest who wrote several works about Egyptian history and culture in Greek — does to the Ptolemies.

** The Seleucids were well aware of the high technical quality of Babylonian astronomy — they [used it as the cornerstone of their own calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_era), which gradually became a reference point throughout the Greek world.
