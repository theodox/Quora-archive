Not really translations, though as time went on footnotes or glossaries became fairly common.

The Homeric dialect was archaic, and sometimes included vocabulary that had fallen out of use. However it was not incredibly alien in the Classical period — the gap in time between, say, Homer and Herodotus is smaller than the gap between us and the King James Bible; the differences there are a reasonable proxy for the level of difference.

The later Hellenistic period produced a lot of commentaries, word lists, and so on intended to help students understand the Homeric texts. The need increased as time went on and conversational Greek continued to evolve. These _[scholia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholia)_ __ (literally, “comments”) evolved into a lively and controversial enterprise. One of the earliest scholiasts was Aristotle himself, who wrote a book (now lost) called _Homeric Questions_  concerning arguments about the Homeric text.

The scholia became extremely important for later Greeks, whose connection to the language of Homer and of Attica was less direct. Many of the foundational principles of later textual criticism were pioneered at the Library of Alexandria, which was primarily devoted to the conservation of the Greek literary canon. For example the asterisk* and the obolos† which we use to mark footnotes derive from marks that Alexandrian scholars used to indicate passages they thought were in need of explanation. The genre remained vibrant right down until the end of the Byzantine period; much of our knowledge of Homer’s more obscure vocabulary or references comes from Byzantine-era scholiasts
