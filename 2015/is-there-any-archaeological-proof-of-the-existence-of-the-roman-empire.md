First, let me do the boring homework bit, as many others have done. 

 There is a overwhelming mass of evidence for the existence of the Roman Empire. Even if you leave out literary sources -- which, it is true, are almost always copies-of-copies-of-copies, given the very limited lifespan of ancient books -- there are:

 Uncounted millions of inscriptions and buildings from Scotland to Syria. While any one could conceivably be a forgery, the cost of planting all of them is inconceivable. Some have been in [continuous use since ancient times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome). others are [excavated new every year](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/02/140225-gladiator-school-discovered-roman-austria-archaeology-science/). The buildings include perfectly preserved living spaces, like at [Pompeii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii), fortifications (often with associated military hardware from [Dura-Europos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura-Europos) in the east to [Isca Dumnoniorum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isca_Dumnoniorum) in the west. We find Latin inscriptions by the thousands, which are catalogued in the [Epigraphic Database](http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/home). 

Even more numerous coins, which confirm the general outlines of the literary history. For example, the battlefield site in Germany where Augustus lost 3 legions in a single day (the [Battle of the Teutoburg Forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest) ) was [ found by a metal-detector enthusiast and amateur historian](http://www.amazon.com/QUEST-FOR-LOST-ROMAN-LEGIONS/dp/1932714707) using a combination of literary sources and digs only in the last twenty years. Coins include both names, dates and symbolism which confirm the literary sources quite well.

Roads and fortifications which show the trade routes and borders discussed in the literature. Archaeologists can track trade patterns with great accuracy: the spread of pottery from [Arretium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_sigillata#Arretine_ware), [Roman glassware, ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_glass) and [metals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_metallurgy) can be mapped using chemical or radioactive dating to show how how goods flowed within the empire and beyond (as far as China). The road network is extensive enough to be visible in satellite photography, and can be cross-dated with other findings such as coins and inscriptions. It matches quite clearly to the boundaries of the Empire as described in literary sources: [The Roman Empire on Google Maps](http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-roman-empire-on-google-maps.html)

Millions of artworks, particularly statues but also paintings. These frequently include Latin and Greek inscriptions and themes from classical literature and history. Politicians used artworks for propaganda purposes and it's fairly easy to see how these map onto the literary history. Since Roman art is primarily realistic, it's easy to see that this statue of Hadrian, found in a military camp in Israel:

and this from Italy:

and this one from Spain:

 and this gold coin:

 along with many others are clearly the same person (note the inscription, which gives the name (_Hadrianus)_ , the date (his 3d consulship, which is probably 119 AD) and on the reverse a memorial to his parents (_divis parentibus,_  Trajan and Plotina



On top of all this, we also do have contemporary written documents -- mostly day-to-day stuff like tax records and court proceedings -- for places where it was easy to preserve papyrus. The [Oxyrhynchus papyri](http://www.ees.ac.uk/research/Oxyrhynchus%20Papyri.html) are a huge treasure trove of documents from Roman Egypt which are first hand (and carbon-datable) references for life in that province and nearby areas. 

The archaeological evidence is overwhelming. We've been finding pieces of Roman history all over the former Roman world -- and even beyond -- for more than a thousand years. And, of course, the Roman empire survived, in a weakened form, down to 1453 in the form of the __[Byzantine Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire)__ __,__  which (among other things) produced all of the Orthodox churches (and the Cyrillic alphabet), and [Ivan the Terrible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Palaiologina); until 1917 Russian Czars considered themselves the rightful heirs of Rome. And of course Charlemagne also "refounded" the Roman empire in the west as the [Holy Roman Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire) in 800, which continued in name at least until 1805.

So: as all the other answers have repeated, this is a set of evidence so huge that the possibility of fraud is basically impossible.

All that said: the real question here is _what do you mean by 'proof'?_  

 The past is always messy: even contemporary events include significant disagreements about what's 'really' happening: just compare a Fox News and MNBC broadcast any night of the week to see how far apart different views of the same events can be. The past is worse, since there are gaps in the evidence, questions of reliability, and the possibility of fraud -- although real fabrications are extremely rare and most are easily detectable. For at least the last 1,000 years historians have been sifting through the physical remains, literary sources, and conflicting interpretations to understand how the Roman empire worked. They argue and debate and contradict each other all the time. So do my in-laws: that doesn't mean my family is a fabrication. It just means we're human.
