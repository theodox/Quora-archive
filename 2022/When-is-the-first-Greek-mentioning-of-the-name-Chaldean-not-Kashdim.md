The oldest written mention is in Herodotus, book 3.155, where he mentions the existence of a “Chaldaean Gate” at Babylon while he’s telling the story of how the Persians captured the city. This would have been in the middle of the __5th century BC,__ say around 450 BC.

According to [a later writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanus_of_Byzantium) , Sophocles (within about a generation of Herodotus) also mentioned Chaldaeans. About a century after that Aristotle talked about their reputation as both astrologers and astronomers alongside the Druids, the Zoroastrian Magi, and “naked philosophers” of India.



It’s likely that the word was floating around earlier since all these writers appear to expect it to be recognizable. It comes to Greek via the Akkadian _Kaldu_  𒆗𒁺, which was the standard way for Assyrians to refer to the southern part of Mesopotamia and it’s inhabitants. Assyrians used Greek mercenaries from sometime in the 8th century onward, so the word may have entered Greek as a result of first hand observations in the mid 700’s BC. Or, it may be another of the cultural borrowings that characterize the “orientalizing period” in Greece, roughly between 700 and 600 BC.

The alternate form _Kašdu 𒅗𒃻𒁺 ,_ which gave is the origin to the biblical Kashdim, is a bit of a puzzle: it might be a reference to the [Kassites ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassites#:~:text=The%20Kassites%20(%2F%CB%88k%C3%A6,1155%20BC%20(short%20chronology).)(who ruled Babylon), it might be derived from the [the verb “to reach” or “to be next to”](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/glass/cbd/akk-x-stdbab/akk-x-stdbab.x0001369.html) , or it might be related to the verb for “conquer.” It does seem to be older than _Kaldu,_ so it’s likely to be closer to the local endonym.
