[Ancient Armies of the Middle East ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0850453844/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0850453844&linkCode=as2&tag=tecsurgui-20&linkId=CJ5DK3J6UPDVZZJN)from Osprey is a nicely illustrated handbook for the whole period covering a variety of the nations. The accuracy varies a lot from one culture to another due to the vagaries of historical preservation -- some folks (like the Egyptians and Assyrians) left a lot of military themed artwork while others (including the Israelites) left only verbal descriptions. 

There's not a ton of great visual material for the period of Exodus, which is conventionally dated between 1200 and 1400 BC: much of what we have to go on is later, often by a few hundred years -- we tend to assume that fashions were relatively constant but we can't always be sure.

Most of the armies of this period were built around archers and lightly-armored spearmen who relied on big shields, usually of wicker covered in leather. Egyptian infantry in particular rarely wore armor, farther east and north scale and leather were more common but not universal "Cavalry" was primarily 2 or 3 man chariots drawn by a team of horses (or, in Mesopotamia, by [onagers). ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onager)Spears were more common (because less expensive and easier to make) than swords, but between 1500 and 1000 BC swords became much more common and higher quality. In 1500 BC bronze was the dominant metal; by 1000 BC iron was pretty common for swords and helmets. Kilts or tunics were the usual wear and most soldiers went barefoot or wore sandals: the Assyrians invented the army boot sometime after 1000 BC.

This image from [Rameses III's monument to the Battle of the Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Delta) around 1175 BC: not only is it very close in date but it's got representatives of many different nations if you look closely (it's a large image - right click it to get the full size).

  The Egyptians are on the right, looking left; you can match them up with the pictures in [Ernest W. Adams](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ernest-W-Adams) answer pretty easily. To the left are the 'Sea Peoples' - a bit, motley multi-ethnic coalition that invaded Egypt at this time. Among the ethnic groups represented are the Peleset (probably the biblical [Philistines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philistines) , lower left in tufted headgear) and the [Sherden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherden) (in the ships and on the second row from bottom wearing what look like Nazi helmets with horns) . 

Here's a closeup of the original:

_From left to right: a Rebu (Libyan), Shekelesh (Sicilian?; note helmet and fringed kilt) what might be Canaanites, and a Peleset._ 

Here's a good site for [more detail on the Medinet Habu images.](http://www.salimbeti.com/micenei/sea.htm)

A better look at a Sherden helmet:

The diagonal lines on the chests may be segmented armor (like a Roman lorica) or may just be wrappings. 

Here's a couple of other useful images

__Assyrians__ . 

Very well documented because they loved to brag about their military achievements. These are all ca. 800 BC (so later than the question) but the style of earlier stuff is fairly similar - kilts and belted knee length robes. Earlier Assyrian armies used long-headed axes and maces but switched to swords.

Assyrian wheeled battering ram ca 800 BC, accompanied by archers in quilted armor.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-395b8619ae10573d0bd8499d1613a35b)

Heavy Assryrian chariot. These held a crew of 3 (Egyptians used 2). Those would be wicker shields covered in leather, probably scale-mail corselets. By this period (750 BC) the helmets are probably iron.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-af98c7c1a62fe533e2322db5455a1d70-c)

 Heavy infantry, ca 750 BC. Bronze or iron helmets, iron spears, wood and leather shields. These would often be teamed with archers so the archer shelter behind those big shields between shots. In other sources these wear bronze or iron scale mail shirts.

Light infantry: Wicker/leather shields

__Hittites__ 

The Hittites were good metalworkers and had high-quality iron and well done bronze work. 

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2b1e15f92e71c7e3d9d17e06092c2572)

Hittite chariot - smaller and more mobile than the heavy Assyrian version, but not as light as the Egyptian type.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dde7ef4f4676d236f69b8f3f30b84b7f)

Hittite scale-mail armor

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-df1c528ea536fffa8b517ace78bb4a5b)

Hittite helmet.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2bb349f7fdf49b5b24e2dc0df0991f29-c)

 Hittite heavy infantry. 

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8c74472e2f16c97976e5519e92be98ad-c)

 That figure-8 shield is very similar in shape (but smaller) to the shields in early Greek art. The helmet may have horns. Note the long sword - Hittite metal work was the best.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-81e127f0c19da7c42b30dbc6603f7463-c)

 The long-beaked axe was common in earlier periods but replaced by swords later on. Another helmet with horns, too.

__Babylonians__ 

Harder to find good source material for, similar in general atmosphere to the Assyrians but less heavily armored.

__Canaanites__ 

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-df042454468db0543dd56eb4c070721e-c)

Same general theme; this is from [Tel Megiddo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Megiddo) ca 1100 BC. 

Horned helmets (as in the Medinet Habu reliefs):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-95cb2de311fe1ff79c0238905362dd1a-c)

and also feathered bucket helmets:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5b2bde521d26903617b02f44d1111c7c)

Some scholars think the Peleset/Philistines are very closely related to the "Trojan War" era Greeks, so things like this boar's tusk helmet might also be found:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b57f44284937a26b3f7cb4232f489357)

If that hypothesis holds then you might see a really, really rich guy in something like the [Dendra panoply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendra_panoply) :

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7ecc4b653dd4dbf78364549def7abd75-c)

(It's green because it's verdigrised bronze).
