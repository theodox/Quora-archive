Linguists spend a lot of time trying to reconstruct historical connections from the examples of living languages -- but it's such a fluid medium that getting back to the real 'origins' of language is very tough and involves a lot of guesswork. For a very well research example [Proto-Indo-European](http://www.archaeology.org/exclusives/articles/1302-proto-indo-european-schleichers-fable) -- the theoretical link between Greek, Latin, German, Farsi, and Sanskrit (among many others) is only about 6000 years back, and it's already a mostly hypothetical language. As these things go it's a pretty solid conjecture -- but it's a looong way from the origins of language; it's not even as old as the last Ice Age.

 As you go farther back from that time you'll get even more guesswork: it's not random, but there's not much evidence to work with apart from the speech of later times and it's hard to know when convergences reflect real historical connections and when they are accidental. Just to illustrate how those guesses are put together, consider the hypothetical -- and nowadays, usually discarded -- [Uralâ€“Altaic language ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural%E2%80%93Altaic_languages)which was thought to be the 'mother tongue' of a whole range of languages from Finland, the Baltics, Hungary, Turkey, Central Asia, Korea and Japan. Nowadays this is usually regarded as a bad guess, heavily influenced by inter-war nationalist politics -- but it's a good example of how you might try to find upstream connections. 

The best modern candidate for 'the language of babel' would be the [Nostratic language hypothesis ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostratic_languages)which posits a common ancestor for most of the languages of the Eurasian landmass about 20,000 years ago, probably originating in the Near East or Mesopotamia. Again, though, this is a highly debated guess.

 The pink area on the map corresponds roughly to the hypothetical Nostratic family. As you can see even then there are plenty of other linguistic groupings.
