Caesar’s clan, the _gens Iulia_ , claimed descent from [Iulus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ascanius) — better known as Ascanius — the son of Aeneas (the hero of the [Aeneid, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid)and the legendary godfather of Rome). In legend Aeneas was a Trojan prince who escaped the fall of Troy and led a party of Trojan exiles to Italy, becoming the foundation of the Roman nation. Aeneas’ father, [Anchises. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchises)was a mortal — but his mother was Venus. So any descendant of Aeneas is a descendant of Venus. This aspect of the story goes way back to the [Homeric Hymns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Hymns) in Greek, so roughly the 8th century BC.

The connection between Iulus/Ascanius and the gens Iulia, appears in the Aeneid, but that’s written a generation after Caesar’s time and its clearly influenced by the way the Julian gens wanted things to be portrayed. We don’t know when exactly the Ascanius = Iulus identification became traditional, but it does go back more than a century before Virgil. The earliest known attestation is probably in the [Origines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origines) of Cato the Elder, probably in the 160s or 170s BC; but it’s not clear how much farther back the story might go. Cato’s version relies on Greek wordplay (he says the name comes from Ιούλος, “beardless”). That might point to a late origin with Romans fluent in Greek (so, maybe the latter 3d century BC) or it might go all the way back to Greek writers trying to plug Latin names and traditions into Greek mythology — in which case it could go all the way back to the dawn of the Republic.

The family name Iulius goes very far back in Roman history — a Caius Iulius served as censor as early as 393, so the family’s claims of antiquity are genuine.
