Don’t leave out our home grown Pacific Northwest contender, the dashingly named [Pig War](http://markmilliorn.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-pig-war.html) — which is occasionally also known as by the equally stirring and martial monicker of the “Potato War” (not, I hasten to point out, the same as the _other_  Potato War, better known as the _[Kartoffelkrieg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Bavarian_Succession)_ _,_ aka the _Zwetschgenrummel_  or “Plum Dust-up”).

The epic Pig War is that it was the last armed conflict between these United States and the British Empire. It also featured the battlefield genius and oratorical flourishes of [George Pickett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickett), who gained the applause of patriotic Americans for promising to make “another Bunker Hill” of San Juan Island. This was four years before he went on to make his greatest contribution to the United States with his climactic failed assault on the Union lines at Gettysburg. The historical impact of this mighty struggle can be duly measured by the fact that no less a diplomatist than Kaiser Wilhelm himself was called in to arbitrate, awarding San Juan to the US in 1876.

Indeed, the significance of this conflict was sufficient to earn its own episode of [Hey Arnold](http://heyarnold.wikia.com/wiki/The_Pig_War). Wait… did I say _lame?_
