A lot of people give the nod to [Majorian, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorian)who has had great press at least since Gibbon: “[he] presents the welcome discovery of a great and heroic character, such as sometimes arise, in a degenerate age, to vindicate the honour of the human species"

_Majorian_ 

However — in a typical move for the time — Majorian was assassinated by his magister militium [Ricimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricimer), who was the real ruler of the last generation of the western empire. Ricimer is also suspected of having at least botched, if not actively sabotaged, the effort to reclaim North Africa from the Vandals. The failure of that expedition is probably the single most important nail in the coffin of the west.
