"Hotels" -- not exactly. 

 Inns, or _[cauponae](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Caupona.html)_ __ were common, where you could rent a room and had some minimal amount of domestic service from the household staff who were almost certainly slaves. Cheap places were basically dormitories: beds (or bedrolls on the floor) in a common space and often shared with strangers. More upscale places would offer private rooms. Inns were common in cities and along trade routes where strangers were frequent. Many of them also doubled as brothels, formally or informally. 

Higher class accomodations were called _[hospitia,](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Hospitium.html)_ a word which derives from an older word for alliance connections between families. In very early times anybody of status would stay with family friends (or friends-of-friends) as a guest rather than using public accommodations: this was both a nicer, safer experience and a way of reinforcing the all-important political and social ties between powerful families; you can somewhat analogize it to the round-robin of country-house visits in the life of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves. 

Eventually wealthier towns and cities provided forms of public _hospitia --_ which could have been dedicated facilities set aside for distinguished guests but were more often a public service performed by civic minded aristocrats who took in high-status visitors as guests at home. The same word was also used as a bureaucratic euphemism for quartering: when soldiers or government officials were stationed somewhere, the local jurisdiction would foist them onto unlucky locals as "guests"*. 

As for restaurants: There were a lot of what amounted to 'fast food' places under several different names: a _taberna_ was basically a shop, which might sell cold-cuts or other kinds of pre-cooked provisions; a _thermopolia_ was a hot-food counter, like a modern lunchonette steam table; __  a _popina_ was a cookshop or restaurant. Many eateries were just counters which sold cooked food and wine to the street, not unlike a New York style pizzeria; others had interiors and tables. Sometimes these were attached to _cauponae._ Like inns, eateries were often pretty seedy and many of these doubled as brothels or gambling dens. However plenty of them were just places for working folks to eat: in big cities, where the working classes were packed into apartment buildings (_insulae_ ) a lot of people didn't have a working kitchen -- they might have a charcoal brazier but that would be about it, both for reasons of expense and to limit the very real danger of fires.

Food shops were common. They were usually in the first floors of apartment buildings although they might also be found in market areas.

 Wealthier people generally had cooks and staff; the best dining would not have been at dedicated restaurants but in private parties. 

_*_ _Much later, as the western Empire fell apart the same word came to refer to the financial and logistical arrangements which supported various barbarian military contingents._ _There's are complex technical arguments about whether your Vandals and Visigoths actually lived with Roman host families or simply got their 'hospitality' in the form of commuted tax payments or rents)._
