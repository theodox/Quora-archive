There were times and places where your options were extremely limited, but even back then the laws of supply and demands still held true: when the demand for labor was tight it was possible (though far, far harder than it is today) for somebody to reinvent themselves and at least escape the peasantry.

Generally escaping the bottom of the social pyramid would mean getting off the land: being a serf — or even a free tenant farmer, which may be almost the same thing — is no way to get rich, particularly not in a world where the law courts are dominated by your wealthier, well-connected neighbors.

The other answers have correctly noted that the church is a good way out: a perfect example would be [pope Sylvester II](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Gerbert.html), who was born to no particular family in France in 945 or so — he entered a local monastery and proved to be a brilliant student, particularly in math (he’s one of the main reasons why Europe adopted Arabic numerals). His academic skills landed him a job as tutor to the future Holy Roman Emperor Otto II. He ended up in the highest circles of both court and church politics and became pope in 999.

_Social mobility only went so far: in part because of his undistinguished family background (as well as his familiarity with Arabic arts and sciences) Sylvester’s political enemies accused him of a pact with Satan._ 

For the less intellectually inclined or less saintly, the main way out was to __get yourself into a city:__ in particularly into a city that had the legal right of self-determination. In German it would be said _[Stadtluft macht frei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadtluft_macht_frei)_ _— “Town air makes free”:_ if you could get legal residency in town with free status, you could shed any residual legal obligations to your feudal betters and establish a new life for yourself. An apprenticeship in a guild trade or with a merchant could, with luck and hard work could turn even a runaway peasant into wealthy free citizen.

Depending on the time and place this could be comparatively easy or extremely hard (the Holy Roman Empire tried, for example, to abolish the Stadhuft principle in the 1230s). Growing cities with a need for labor were very welcoming and not overly cooperative with angry lords who wanted their runaway peasants back — Florence, for example, attracted skilled labor from as far away as Scotland, Hungary, and Spain. On the other hand city guilds tried, with varying degrees of success, to keep newcomers out of skilled professions - particularly when the economy was tight.

Nobles sometimes got in on the act too: as German warlords pushed their realms to the east, they recruited settlers from all over Europe to people their new territories, often with very generous concessions. German emperors even created [Ministeriales:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerialis) legally serfs but in practice, powerful administrators or even knights who competed with the “real” nobility for power and influence.

Social snobbery and legal restrictions were powerful, but they were not enough to defeat the economic power of the cities and the need for professional bureaucrats. In Italy, Flanders, or the Hanseatic League cities a successful townsman could become wealthy and powerful — By the 1300’s the richest people in Europe weren’t nobles or even kings (whose finances were usually in terrible shape) but the merchant elites of Italy, the Low Countries, and the Baltic.

Of course town society itself was not necessarily egalitarian: the civic elites of the cities may not have been noble*, but they could still be intensely snobbish and they guarded the inner circle of their towns closely. Several cities in Italy had what amounted to class wars, the most famous being the [Ciompi Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciompi_Revolt) in Florence.

Even so, the ordinary feudal system — where the wealth of the nobles was primarily in rents derived from their tenants — didn’t like to lose laborers to the towns. Besides losing workers, flight also increased the bargaining power of those who stayed behind. Nobles tried to use the courts (which of course they controlled) to enforce traditional obligations; it wasn’t unheard of for local feudal lords to fight wars with towns that were too flagrant in siphoning away workers — and more than few towns (including Florence, Bruges, and Laon) were founded by armed revolts against feudal lords. There’s a reason medieval towns were walled!

Underlying all the political conflict was the ebb and flow of economic power. Generally the cities were rising from the 10th to the 13th centuries, and then declined until the 15th or 16th — but local variations were more noticeable than general trends. It was easier for kings and barons to assert themselves against the cities when money was tight or labor was plentiful. Power politics — particularly when a really big war broke out — could advance or retard the freedom of cities: the Hundred Years War, for example, tended to diminish the independence of many French cities which either needed military protection or lost their wealth and thus their power. The Black Death — which hit cities far harder than the countryside — also played a double role: areas which had more social mobility before the plague tended to lose it in the aftermath: the Italian cities states and north-eastern Europe, in particular, tended to become more aristocratized after the plague. On the other hand areas with worse social mobility before the 1340’s tended to get better, since the long-term labor shortage gave even tenants who stayed on the land more bargaining power.



_* In Italy, for example, the big merchant families of Venice and Florence were all of non-noble origin but between the 14th and 17th century they gradually acquired both the titles and habits of their rural aristocratic rivals: the Medici of Florence were commoners though they were the wealthiest family in Europe — until they converted the Florentine Republic into a duchy in the 1530’s._
