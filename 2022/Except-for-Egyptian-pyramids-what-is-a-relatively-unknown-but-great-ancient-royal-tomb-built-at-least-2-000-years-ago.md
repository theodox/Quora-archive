I’m rather partial to [the Tomb Of Agamemnon](https://www.world-archaeology.com/features/treasury-of-atreus-at-mycenae/), at Mycenae. It’s a tholos or beehive style tomb and is a really remarkable piece of engineering for 1250 BC or thereabouts. Because of its association with Homer and “barbaric splendor,” Mycenean civilization is often underrated: seen as a hunched-over Neanderthal predecessor of the “real” Greek civilization which followed five hundred years later. But the Mycenaeans built some remarkable stuff. and this particular example is especially impressive because it predates more familiar examples of domed Roman structures by a thousand years or more — and because it was built without the help of Roman concrete.

As for Agamemnon… well…. that’s what Schliemann _called_ it, but there’s no hard evidence that the building was really a tomb, much less one belonging to the named character from the _Iliad_ . Still it’s a pretty remarkable structure for the late Bronze Age.

Speaking of impressive tombs that might-or-might-not belong to characters out of classical legends, the so-called [Tomb of Midas ](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/gordium/gordium-tomb-of-midas/#:~:text=The%20Great%20Tumulus%2C%20or%20Tumulus,about%206%20x%205%20meters.&text=(According%20to%20Eusebius%2C%20this%20Midas%20died%20in%20695.))is another tribute to why it’s good to be — or at least to have been — the king.

Actually this one _might_  fit the historical [Midas ](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/midas/)(famous from legends like the [golden touch](https://www.storynory.com/the-midas-touch/) and the [ass’s ears](https://greece.mrdonn.org/greekgods/kingmidas2.html), but a reasonably well attested king of Phrygia circa 700 BC). A pot sherd found in nearby Gordium actually mentions the king by name:

It’s more likely that the tomb belongs to Midas’s father: dendrochronology would date the tomb to 740 BC or thereabouts, which would be when the historic Midas took the throne, not when he died. Architecturally, this tumulus is less impressive than the one from Mycenae (though it’s big: 300 meters across and 47 meters high!). But the tight seal of the tomb, unbroken until the 1950’s, preserved the contents quite well — including a lot of organic material that rarely survives. Amazingly, the remnants of the king’s funeral feast were sufficiently intact that we have a pretty good idea of the menu (a barbecued lamb and lentil stew — [recipe here](https://www.ancientrecipes.org/the-funerary-feast-of-king-midas-stew/#:~:text=Midas%20Stew%20Recipe-,The%20Funerary%20Feast%20of%20King%20Midas%20Stew%20is%20a%20recipe,%2C%20located%20in%20Yassih%C3%B6y%C3%BCk%2C%20Turkey.)). Most amazingly, [we found the chemical signature of the world’s oldest documented cocktail](https://www.penn.museum/sites/biomoleculararchaeology/?page_id=501): a mix of wine, beer made from barley and saffron(!), and mead. The mix was subsequently reconstructed by the Dogfish Head Brewery and is available as, predictably, “[Midas Touch.](https://www.dogfish.com/brewery/beer/midas-touch)” Have to appreciate the ancient tomb that really gives back to the community!
