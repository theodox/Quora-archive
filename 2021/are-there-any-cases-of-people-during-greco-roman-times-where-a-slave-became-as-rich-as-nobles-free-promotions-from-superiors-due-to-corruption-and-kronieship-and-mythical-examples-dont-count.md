__Original wording__ : _Are there any cases of people during Greco-Roman times where a slave became as rich as nobles (free promotions from superiors due to corruption and kronieship and mythical examples don't count)?_ 

First, an example that exactly satisfies the conditions of the question.

Here’s the tomb of [Eurysaces,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Eurysaces_the_Baker) one of the most famous Roman tombs:

If you’re at all familiar with Roman architecture, you might wonder what you’re seeing: the circular openings are actually an architectural reference to grain bins. A closer look at the decorations shows that Eurystaces was an industrial scale baker:

We know from the inscription that Eurysaces was a former slave: his full name is the Roman-Greek hybrid Marcus Vergilius Eurysaces — presumably this means he was owned by one of the Vergilii. Eurysaces does not mention his parentage, where a well-born Roman able to afford a monument of this size would have emphasized his lineage.

We know from the scale, quality, and location of the tomb that Eurysaces was very wealthy. He lists himself as a baker and a “contractor”: but in this case the “contract” was for the [annona ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura_Annonae)the massive public food program in the city of Rome. This was a vast undertaking in which vast fortunes could be made — and Eurysaces chose to spend some of his on a very large, visible and nontraditional tomb in a very visible location, right where the Via Labicana and the Via Pranestina met, very close to the sacred center of the city where burials where prohibited. Roman aristocrats vied for visible spots on the roads leading into the city where they could advertise their wealth and power to everyone passing by. Eurysaces chose to do the same and clearly had the money do so.

It is worth noting, however, that the classic examples of wealthy ex-slaves do tend to come from the political realm, where cronyism and corruption were an important part of the picture.

Particularly in the early imperial period, the administration of the empire was largely handled by slaves: aristocrats occupied the visible public positions but the “professional” civil services was mostly in the hands of slaves: the accountants, secretaries, bureaucrats and administrators who actually handled the day-to-day business of Rome were either current or former slaves. They were seen as more reliable than potentially ambitious aristocrats, and they typically served long tenures which gave them detailed technical knowledge of how the empire was run. But independent of their job descriptions, imperial slaves and freedmen were personally close to the center of power, and could exert tremendous influence at court — which tended to translate into money on an enormous scale.

It was a common complaint of conservative aristocrats that many of the wealthiest men in Rome were freedmen, usually from the imperial household. A good example is [Pallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallas_(freedman)), a freedman of Antonia (Marc Antony’s daughter, a niece of emperor Augustus) who served as the chief treasurer under emperor Claudius. He was said to have had a personal fortune of about 300,000,000 sesterces (for comparison purposes: about a quarter of the empire’s annual budget!). Pallas was a key player in court intrigue, figuring prominently in the gossip stories about Claudius’ court which were fictionalized in [I, Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Claudius). Imperial politics was a high-stakes game and Pallas was put to death by Nero after Claudius’s death — but his family survived an about a century later one of his descendants was a senator and a consul. It was[ a bitter joke among impoverished blue-bloods that the Senate erected a public memorial celebrating “frugality” of the former slave who turned down a grant of five million sesterces.](http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny8.html#6)

Stories like that were quite common in the early empire, when the imperial household and the imperial bureaucracy were more or less the same. This is the period satirized by the famous, fictional [Trimalchio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimalchio#:~:text=Trimalchio%20is%20an%20arrogant%20former,occidental%20form%20Malchio%20or%20Malchus.) in the [Satyricon](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5225/5225-h/5225-h.htm), the fabulously wealthy but infamously vulgar nouveau-riche freedman. It’s worth noting, however, that many of the character studies in the Satyricon are of other rich freedmen as well; the existence of a whole society of wealthy but uncultivated freedman is the comic milieu of the whole poem.

Trimalchio and his friends are fictional, but they served a useful purpose for irritated aristocrats. The detailed dissection of Trimalchio’s many lapses in tasted and refinement were an important consolation to the traditional upper classes: to the polished, birth-conscious Roman aristocrat who had to watch as former slaves occupied positions of great wealth and power, this kind of mockery offered some passive-aggressive consolation. The highly negative portrayal of wealthy freedmen in Tacitus and Suetonius serves a similar function. But — to give the book some credit — the freedmen bite back once in a while:

> Ascyltos, lost to all self-control, threw his arms up in the air, and turning the whole proceedings into ridicule, laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks. At this once of the freedmen among the guests, the same who occupied the place next above me, lost his temper and shouted:

> "What are you laughing at, muttonhead? Isn't my master's elegant hospitality to your taste? You're a mighty fine gentleman, I suppose, and used to better entertainment. So help me the guardian spirits of this house, but I would have made him baa to some purpose, had I been next him. A pretty sprig indeed, to laugh at other people! a vagabond from who knows where, a night-raker, that's not worth his own piddle! Just let me piss round him, and he would not know how to save his life! By the powers, I'm not as a rule quick to take offense, but there! worms are bred in soft flesh. He's laughing; what's he got to laugh at? Did his father buy the brat for money? You're a Roman knight: and I'm a king's son. 'Why did you serve as a slave then?' Why! because I chose to, and thought it better to be a Roman citizen than a tributary king. And henceforth I hope to live a life beyond the reach of any one's ridicule. I am a man now among men; I can walk about with my nose in the air. I owe nobody a brass farthing; I've never made composition; no one ever stopped me in the forum with a 'Pay me that thou owest!' I've bought some bits of land, put by a trifle of tin; I keep twenty folks in victuals, to say nothing of the dog; I've purchased my bedfellow's freedom, that no man should wipe his hands on her bosom; I paid a thousand denars to redeem her; I was made a sevir, free gratis for nothing; I trust I may die and have no cause to blush in my grave.

> "But you, are you so busy you can't so much as look behind you? You can spy a louse on a neighbor's back, and never see the great tick on your own. You're the only man to find us ridiculous; there's your master and your elder, he likes us well enough, I warrant. You! with your mammy's milk scarce dry on your lips, you can't say boo! to a goose; you crock, you limp scrap of soaked leather, you may be supple, but you're no good. Are you richer than other folk? then dine twice over, and sup twice! For myself I value my credit far above millions. Did any man ever dun me twice? I served forty years, but nobody knows whether I was slave or free. I was a long-haired lad when first I came to this town; the basilica was not built yet. But I took pains to please my master, a great, grand gentleman and a dignified, whose nail-parings were worth more than your whole body. And I had enemies in the house, let me tell you, quite ready to trip me up on occasion; but--thanks to his kind nature--I swam the rapids. That's the real struggle; for to be born a gentleman is as easy as 'Come here.'"
