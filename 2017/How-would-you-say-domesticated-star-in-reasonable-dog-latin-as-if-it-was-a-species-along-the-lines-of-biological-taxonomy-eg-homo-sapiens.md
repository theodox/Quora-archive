_aster domesticus_ is the first thing that comes to mind, although you could presumably use _stella familiaris. Aster_  is grammatically male, _stella_ female if that makes a difference for your use-case.

If the emphasis is on ‘tamed’ rather than on ‘nearby, familiar’ then you could use _cicur_  or _mansueta_ . _aster cicur, stella cicur, aster mansuetus, stella mansueta_
