There's a whole community, known as the [Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene), devoted to making 3d art and music in the smallest possible footprint -- this was a culture that orginated in the late 80's and early 90's with the rise of affordable graphics focused machines like the Atari ST and the Commodore. Their work gives you a pretty good idea of what can be accomplished. I believe [prodlist :: pouët.net](http://www.pouet.net/prodlist.php) is the big Demoscene website these days. It looks like they still have [.kkrieger by .theprodukkt](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=12036)

Other sources for what's out there: 
a decent demoscene YouTube channel: [Demoscene High-Quality Videos (Annikras)](https://www.youtube.com/user/Annikras)
and a subreddit: [demoscene • /r/Demoscene](https://www.reddit.com/r/Demoscene/)

As for size: this one is 256 BYTES! It's not interactive... but still - way smaller than plenty of emails !
