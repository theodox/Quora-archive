There are several major strata in the population of the Iberian penninsula (bearing in mind that culture and genetics aren't the same thing - languages and lifestyles generally travelled faster in antiquity than people).

The [ Basques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Basques) are usually thought to be the inheritors of the original neolithic population of the peninsula. Basque -related cultures and languages were gradually relegated to less accessible areas in the north as other peoples/cultures moved in.

The [Iberians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberians)are also very old, and their original language seems not to have been Indo-European; they might be related to the neolithic population or they may be connected to the early populations of Corsica and Sardinia. The legendary city of [Tartessos,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartessos) which was famous in the Bronze age but largely lost to later ages, is probably an Iberian settlement.

Around the 6th c. BC Celtic pastoralists moved into the peninsula -- they were part of the very widely diffused Celtic cultural world (again, it's worth being cautious about the genetics) which ranged from the British Isles through France, Central Europe, the Balkans and down into Asia Minor (see [Why didn't an empire rise in non Roman Europe?](https://www.quora.com/Wy-didnt-an-empire-rise-in-non-Roman-Europe) for more). Over time this group tended to fuse with the pre-existing Iberian and Basque populations, and the resulting cultures are lumped together as [Celtiberians.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtiberians#History)

Greeks and Romans had a number of colonies on the southern and eastern coasts of Spain. These were not demographically very significant but they had big cultural influences on the local peoples: the Carthaginians, in particular, were deeply invested in Spain -- it as the fulcrum of their long-running rivalry with Rome. The "Carthaginian" army of Hannibal was more really Celtiberian and Gallic than Carthaginian; in later centuries the Romans also made very extensive use of auxiliaries from Hispania.

The Romans came later, mostly as an outgrowth of their wars with Carthage. However as time went on they planted many colonies in the Spanish territory they wrested from Carthage. Unlike the Greek and Carthaginians colonies these had more an in impact on the population and, over time, also on the culture. The long inclusion of Spain in the Roman empire also brought trade and commerce with the rest of the Mediterranean world -- Spain had at least some Syrians, Greeks, North Africans, and even Britons while trade and travel were still comparatively easy. There was also a Jewish population that is old enough that its origins aren't clear, but it presumably dates to the Roman period.

TLDR: "its complicated."
