There’s a story in Herodotus (4.42) that Pharoah [Necho II ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necho_II)(a late ruler, around 600 BC) [sent an expedition manned by Phoenician sailors to circumnavigate Africa](https://www.quora.com/Did-Ancient-Egyptians-circumnavigate-the-continent-of-Africa-How-difficult-is-it/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=115859035&share=9a7a0248&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer). The squadron supposedly took three years to sail from the Red Sea to Carthage.

Their report would have been the first real unambiguous experience of the Atlantic in Egyptian history. Egyptian expansion to the west was very limited. Egypt’s westernmost political outposts were Amunia (“Amun’s town”) on the coast near modern Mersah Matruh and the Oasis of Siwa. Both of these are within the borders of modern Egypt, and over 2500 miles / 4000 km from the Atlantic coast.

For most of Egyptian history, the combination powerful Libyan or Berber tribes and the sparsely habitable land kept Egypt from looking farther west. From the early Bronze Age, it was Phoenician sailors (followed later by Greeks) who dominated the long-distance trade of the Mediterranean. Even in the New Kingdom era, when Egypt was at its most expansionist, Egyptian references to places west of the Delta are few and far between compared to numerous references to places in the Levant, Arabia, and Nubia (all frequent theaters of war) along with sketchier references to Crete, the Aegean, and Mesopotamia.

Egyptian trade goods do show up as far west as Sicily and Malta, and it’s commonly assumed that the Egyptian name _Sherden,_ applied to mercenaries and pirates in the later Bronze Age, refers to Sardinians. We can see a limited circulation of Egyptian goods in the western Mediterranean — mostly, we think, via Cretan, Mycenean and later Phoenican or Greek merchants. This presumably included a few Egyptians; we’ve found a couple of Egyptian funeral monuments in Malta and Tunisia. So, it’s entirely possible that some Egyptian individuals had heard of a great ocean to the west. However official Egypt — the folks who wrote down tribute lists and tried to catalogue the known world — seem not to have heard or cared much about anything to the west of the western desert. If you asked an Egyptian about the far west, he’d assume you were referring to the afterlife, which was conceived of as the land beyond the setting of the sun.
