Well, people from Pompeii got around: the city had a large and [popular temple to the Egyptian goddess Isis](http://pompeiisites.org/en/archaeological-site/temple-of-isis/), and among the other curios turned up at the excavation is[ a very out-of-place Indian statue:](https://www.ancientworldmagazine.com/articles/indian-figurine-pompeii/)

So, it’s quite likely that there were a few people in Pompeii who’d look “black” to modern American eyes. However there’s quite a good deal of pictorial art from Pompeii and very little of it shows people with stereotypical African features.

There are a range of complexions in Pompeii art — pretty much always, women are depicted as much paler than men. We’ve found remnants of [cosmetics in Pompeii](http://file///C:/Users/steve/Downloads/Marks_Beatrice_thesis_2017%20(1).pdf) — like other Roman ladies of this era, the women of Pompeii used lead or chalk based face powder to achieve an extra pale complexion. In a world where most labor was outdoors, a life led in the shade was a sign of wealth and status.

Although the people depicted in Pompeii are overwhelmingly “Mediterranean” looking (blondes and redheads are present, but far from a majority) there are also depictions of other phenotypes as well.

However, most of the dark-skinned people in Pompeii art are not depicted as living _in_  Pompeii. The same vogue for Egyptian ideas which gave the town its Isis temple also led to a fad for Egyptian decorative motifs — scenes of the Nile, with crocodiles, pyramids, and ancient statuary — were popular subjects for paintings. Several of these Egyptian theme pictures include figures that are much more stereotypically “African” than those in other Pompeiian art.

_A detail from a Nile scene. The_ _[darker figures are supposed to be pygmies](https://www.worldhistory.org/image/7966/the-banquet-of-the-pygmies/)_ _— a popular subject in Greek art going back to the days of Homer. It’s hard to know if this was fantasy or represented any contemporary Egyptian realities.

There some less fantastic images — still set in Egypt, as indicated by the palm trees and ibises — showing Isis-worshippers of several backgrounds, including a few people who would almost certainly pass for “black” in contemporary usage:

The birds and the foliage indicate it’s supposed to be in Egypt, but the diversity of the crowd would not have been completely shocking to a Roman audience in AD 79.

The one image I’m aware which is probably supposed to represent a person of African descent in a contemporary Pompeiian setting is the “Family Banquet” fresco from the Museo Archaeologico in Naples:

It should not come as a surprise that most of the people in Pompeiian art look like the people who live in the area now. The city was originally founded by [Etruscans ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_civilization)about seven centuries before its eventual destruction. It was conquered by the [Samnites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samnites#:~:text=The%20Samnites%20(Oscan%3A%20Safineis),Campania%20in%20south%2Dcentral%20Italy.), a central Italian people who spoke a language similar to Latin and whose culture was indigenous to Italy. Greek influence from nearby Greek colonies was part of the city’s culture from early on. Despite having a pretty cosmpolitan culture with commercial ties to Egypt (starting after around 160 BC or so ) it was a fundamentally Italian city. So far we’ve [only found DNA from one source in Pompeii](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10899-1); his DNA is pretty similar to that of modern central Italians and Sardinians. Further study will probably add more detail to this simplistic picture but it’s not likely to somehow reverse it.
