_Agimus quod agimus_ would also work . _facio_ tends to connote creation of something, where _ago_ would connote ‘making things happen.’

If the use case was about, say, building stuff (say, a motto for a contractor) I’d go with _facimus quod facimus_ and if it we about, say, organizing people I’d go with _agimus quod agimus ._
