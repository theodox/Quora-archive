Obviously, it is tough to know.

The art that survives is pretty ambiguous - Egyptian and Hellenistic styles both tend to idealization, though of different kinds. Generally, the Egyptianate work produced for domestic consumption is so stylized, it provides almost no individuality at all:

The Greek style statuary isn’t always in the best shape, and there are only a few pieces. The most famous one is this:

The coinage, on the other hand, is realistic in intent but less flattering:

Many coins of Cleopatra’s date from her period with Marc Antony, when she was considerably older than the bust above, so that may be part of the difference. The more detailed coin at the bottom is also from a Syrian, rather than an Egyptian mint so there might be local customs influencing the design. Above all, of course, there’s the variation in artistic style and competence; with so few surviving pieces to work from it’s hard to know.

There’s not a lot of disinterested contemporary literary evidence either. Friends of Augustus found it convenient to portray Cleopatra as an irresistible seductress for political reasons, regardless of personal tastes. For example Lucan compared her to Helen of Troy.

> Caesar unknowing, entered Egypt’s shame; fury of Latium; to the bane of Rome Unchaste. For as the Spartan queen of yore By fatal beauty Argos urged to strife And Ilium’s homes, so Cleopatra roused Italia’s frenzy.

The most often cited text is this, from Plutarch:

> her actual beauty, it is said, was not in itself so remarkable that none could be compared with her, or that no one could see her without being struck by it, but the contact of her presence, if you lived with her, was irresistible; the attraction of her person, joining with the charm of her conversation, and the character that attended all she said or did, was something bewitching. It was a pleasure merely to hear the sound of her voice, with which, like an instrument of many strings

Plutarch’s judgement — that it was Cleopatra’s personality rather than her person which entranced both Caesar and Antony — has long been the most common one, but there’s clearly room for some personal opinion. For what it’s worth, he says in one place that his grandfather was friends with [Philotas, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philotas_(physician))a doctor who worked for Marc Antony’s son in Alexandria. Presumably his information was from someone in a position to know.
