Unfortunately our evidence is both very punchy and entirely misleading. It’d be easy to write an answer like this:

Athenian audiences laughed themselves silly over the presentation of Socrates (by name) in Aristophanes’ comedy _[The Clouds.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clouds)_ __ More than two millennia of Socrates’ defenders have complained that the picture Aristophanes paints is very unfair — Socrates in the play alternates between dotty absent-minded-professor antics and teaching people sly rhetorical tricks — but there’s no question that the broad audience was expected to recognize the character. While it wasn’t the winner of the comedy contest at the Dionysia (in 423 BC) it did come in number three — most of the citizen body will have either seen it or have heard most of the jokes repeated later.

_The Clouds_  gives one idea of the reputation philosophers had in the eyes of the public at large, and it’s not a particularly positive one. Socrates in _The Clouds_ is either a buffoon or — in an disturbing preview of his eventual fate — a sleazy huckster undermining traditional values. Plato eventually laid some of the blame for Socrates’ eventual trial and execution at the feet of Aristophanes — when Plato depicts Socrates defending himself against people who slander and misrepresent his ideas, he says this in the [Apology](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/apology.html):

> For I have had many accusers, who accused me of old, and their false charges have continued during many years; and I am more afraid of them than of [my accuser] Anytus and his associates, who are dangerous, too, in their own way. But far more dangerous are these, who began when you were children, and took possession of your minds with their falsehoods, telling of one Socrates, a wise man, who speculated about the heaven above, and searched into the earth beneath, and made the worse appear the better cause. These are the accusers whom I dread; for they are the circulators of this rumor, and their hearers are too apt to fancy that speculators of this sort do not believe in the gods. And they are many, and their charges against me are of ancient date, and they made them in days when you were impressible - in childhood, or perhaps in youth - and the cause when heard went by default, for there was none to answer. And, hardest of all, their names I do not know and cannot tell; unless in the chance of a comic poet.

On the other hand it wasn’t all suspicion; some of the popular attitude was simply mockery. Plato himself attracted the barbs of comic poets (this might account for why his version of Socrates Apology singles out Aristophanes, while Xenophon’s doesn’t mention them). This is another sign that ordinary Athenians had enough of an idea who Plato was to appreciate jokes at his expense; for example the comedy leading man who tells his sidekick

> You have come in the nick of time. For I am at my wits' end and walking up and down, like Plato, and yet have discovered no wise plan but only tired my legs.

Presupposes that people have actually heard of the philosopher’s habit of discoursing on the hoof.

Plato’s career illustrates another aspect of the level of recognition afforded to philosophers. He was, for example, invited to the court of Syracuse to help provide a kind some philosophical window dressing for the regime their, which shows that in elite circles his reputation had spread pretty widely. When he fell out with [Dionysius I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_I_of_Syracuse), however, the tyrant had him sold into slavery in Aegina, a city on perpetually unfriendly terms with Athens. [According to one version of the story](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D1), Aegina had a law which decreed death for any Athenian who set foot on the island and Plato was brought to trial — but the jury refused to execute him because he was a famous philosopher. A visitor to Aegina, who knew of Plato’s reputation, ransomed him and brought him home to Athens. Plato wanted to repay his benefactor, but the generous friend refused; in the end Plato used to money to purchase the garden which became the famous [Academy](https://www.quora.com/Did-Plato-open-a-school/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=48f98830&srid=zLvM).

Based on those examples, it’d be easy to assume that the average Greek in the street could tell Plato from Aristotle, and maybe took sides in their disagreements over philosophical idealism. However, that’s probably not really representative.

For one thing, we have to remember that our sources are very, very Athens-centric. While Athenian culture was very influential in fourth century BC Greece, it’s a mistake to generalize from the pretty high degree of visibility that these famous Athenians had. Athens was not really that big: while Attica as a whole probably housed around 300,000 people, but the city proper (where people rubbed shoulders on a regular basis) was probably only about 50,000 — the size of a large midwestern university campus. In that kind of community it’s not surprising that much of the community would have at least a vague idea of who the leading personalities are, particularly in a world without the infinite distractions of modern media.

However that kind of intimacy had no easy way to _travel_ . A farmer from one of the border districts like [Rhamnous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamnous) had to walk for two days to get to the city proper and probably only came in a few times a year. He’d probably have a hard time getting all those jokes about Socrates and would have had to content himself with the burlesque antics and giant inflatable phalluses with which the comic poets padded out their plays.

Outside of Attica, cultural cachet traveled even more sluggishly. Merchants traveled for business. Aristocrats traveled for political reasons, or to arrange alliances or marriages with aristocratic clans in other cities. The better off among both groups would probably have some kind of connection to Athens that would let them hear the gossip and catch up on the latest ideas. But for the most part they’d be miss a lot of the references. And only a tiny fraction of that mobile minority were really closely connected to the small, clannish world of the Athenian intelligentsia.

Some kinds of ideas did travel very widely and with surprising speed. Poetry was the ancient equivalent of pop radio — it was cheap to produce and widely disseminated (for example, after the Athenian expedition to Sicily ended in disaster, most of the survivors were worked to death in Sicilian quarries. A few, however, earned their freedom by reciting the works of Euripides for their new owners.) However for philosophers — who wrote prose, not poetry, and tackled subjects with less mass-market appeal than love and war — the only route to widespread fame was through books. But books were luxury items, out of reach for ordinary people until the Ptolemies opened up papyrus production on a larger scale in the third century BC.

So, to answer the question as asked: the _average_  Greek person probably had no idea at all who Socrates or Plato was in the fourth century BC. Educated people, who were able to afford books and who were connected to the aristocratic social networks where philosophy was a mark of culture probably did know, but they formed a small minority of the population as a whole.

In the years between Alexander and the coming of Rome, literacy and Athenian style education did become much more common everywhere in the Greek speaking world. We’ve found [fragments of otherwise unknown works of Aristotle on the far eastern border of Afghanistan](http://For the Sicilians, it would seem, more than any other Hellenes outside the home land, had a yearning fondness for his poetry. They were forever learning by heart the little specimens and morsels of it which visitors brought them from time to time, and imparting them to one another with fond delight. In the present case, at any rate, they say that many Athenians who reached home in safety greeted Euripides with affectionate hearts, and recounted to him, some that they had been set free from slavery for rehearsing what they remembered of his works; and some that when they were roaming about after the final battle they had received food and drink for singing some of his choral hymns), and [Jewish schoolboys in Alexandria penned Greek essays on Plato’s theory of ideas](http://platonism347.tripod.com/philo_of_alexandria.htm). By the Roman period the upper and upper-middle classes of the whole Greco-Roman world were familiar with most of the big names in classical philosophy, though the relative fame of different philosophers came and went with cycles of fashion.

_The “Hall of the Philosophers” in Rome’s Capitoline Museum is a tribute to the eventual celebrity of many philosophers.
