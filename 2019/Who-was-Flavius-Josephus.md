Josephus is a tragic figure — a witness to the horrible vicissitudes of the Roman-Jewish war of the first century.

__Origins__ 

Josephus was born a [Sadducee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadducees), meaning he belonged to the hereditary priestly class of Judaea. In his day the Sadducees were essentially a hereditary aristocracy — they were closely tied to the ritual function of the Temple in Jerusalem and also to the Jewish state.* In a very general way you can imagine them as the “gentry” class of 18th century Britain — a conservative ‘squirearchy’ which was the bulwark of the ‘church’ (or temple) and the state. Josephus’ family came from the upper ranks of the Sadducee class: his mother was connected to the ruling dynasty and his father was descended from a long line of hereditary priests connected to the ruling house.

Young Josephus — if we can believe his account, which is not always the case — was a seeker, and he seems to have broken with Sadducee traditionalism. He is one of our best sources for rival versions of Judaism in the first century: the [Essenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essenes), an ascetic community focused on a personal, spiritual approach to Judaism and the [Pharisees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees), who developed the methods of debate and interpretation which eventually became modern Judaism. Josephus even flirted with more esoteric practices; as a young man he spent some years living in the desert with a hermit before returning to his life of privilege.

After his youthful enthusiasms, he must have returned to a more respectable life: at age 26 (in 63 or 64 CE) he was part of a Jewish mission to Rome, sent to secure the release of several Jewish priests who had been imprisoned by the Romans. He succeeded — in part, thanks to the influence of Jewish actor in Rome who introduced him to the emperor’s wife and helped secure her intervention.

__Wartime__ 

On his return to Judaea, however, he was drawn into the rapidly escalating violence between the Jews and the Roman occupation. The region has been wracked by conflict for some time — there were long-standing animosities between the Jews and their Hellenized neighbors, as well as between Jewish traditionalists and those who wanted to assimilate into the surrounding Greco-Roman culture. In 66 the tensions broke out into open warfare.

In Josephus’s autobiographical accounts, he describes himself as a moderate who opposed both Jewish extremists and Roman anti-Semites. However his position is more complicated than that: by the end of 66 he was a military commander in the insurgent forces in Galilee. We don’t have other information to set against his self-description, but it seems like an unusual position for a ‘moderate’ to have ended up in. On the other hand Josephus’ forces didn’t only fight the Romans — they also fought against [John of Giscala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Giscala), the most extreme of the anti-Roman leaders.

__Collaborator__ 

The other reason to be suspicious of Josephus’s self-portrayal is what happened next: before 67 was out Josephus had surrendered to the Romans. His version of the story is that he and 40 of his colleagues were cornered in a cave and decided to kill themselves rather than surrender; however they paired up for the executions and when only Josephus and one other defender were left neither had the heart to slay the other and they both surrendered. Needless to say his detractors have never believed that story, and regard him as a traitor.

From a captive, Josephus soon became a collaborator: whether because he was a moderate or because he wanted to save himself, he acted as a translator and negotiator for the Roman armies which laid siege to Jerusalem. He was present, a helpless witness, when the Roman armies breached the walls.

Josephus watched as the Romans destroyed the Temple — though in his writings he tries very hard to depict this as an accident — and most of the city. He saw the executions of most of the adult male population of the city, and the enslavement of the women and all those under 17. His claims the number of killed and enslaved at 1.1 million persons: most modern historians dismiss this as inflated, but it’s more likely an index of the psychological impact of the catastrophe than a failure of arithmetic.

__Exile__ 

In the aftermath of the war, Josephus used his Roman connections to rescue friends and relations where he could. He evidently was a valued collaborator: although the Romans confiscated his family estate for a military camp, the gave him a new property to replace it.

He seems to have been personally close with the Roman commanders, the future emperors [Vespasian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian) and [Titus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus); when Titus returned to Rome in 71 Josephus accompanied him. He would live there for the rest of his life as a privileged — but never entirely free — apparatchik of the Roman court. He lived in Rome, writing books which were intended to justify his people, his Roman benefactors, and his own checkered history until his death in the year 100.

__Works__ 

In his Roman exile, he wrote the books which are his major source of this fame. [The Jewish War](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2850/2850-h/2850-h.htm) is his account of the war itself. [The Antiquities of the Jews](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm) is his telling of the history of the Jewish people — it’s mostly a retelling of the historical books of the Bible, recast in a form that makes it read like a conventional Greek history, intended to ‘normalize’ the Jews in the eyes of a Greco-Roman reading public which was at that point intensely antisemitic. His least well known book is [Against Apion](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2849/pg2849.txt), a retort to a Greek-Egyptian antisemitic tract.

All of his works are marked by a [complex mix of attitudes](https://www.quora.com/How-Jewish-are-Philo-and-Josephus-in-their-writing): he simultaneously wants to protect Jews and Jewish beliefs from the hostility of the wider culture, while at the same time denouncing the extremists among his own people who contributed to the calamity. He wants to proclaim Jewish exceptionalism and at the same time to normalize Jewish beliefs and practices for readers who are inclined to suspicion. He is clearly writing with the knowledge that neither his Roman protectors nor his coreligionists can completely trust him. And, of course, every line he wrote was penned under the watchful eye of the Roman state. In short, he’s a desperately compromised figure with few natural allies. Not surprisingly, he has had a villainous reputation in Judaism for the last two millennia.

__Modernity__ 

The other reason Josephus is famous (or infamous) is that the _Antiquities_  contains [references to Jesus Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus), making it one of the oldest such mentions outside the Bible. These handful of paragraphs have, inevitably, attracted a lot of attention and controversy as to their authenticity. The usual scholarly position is that “some” of the material in our editions is authentic and “some” of it was added later by Christian copyists, but the consensus gets shakier when anyone tries to attach clear values to “some.”

Regardless of his value as a writer, as a witness to events, or as a man Josephus is a priceless source for many otherwise poorly recorded events in the first century. Love him or hate him, trust him or not, it’s impossible to write the history of this period without him.
