No — they never really had the opportunity.

Native Egyptians had basically lost their independence before the Greeks and Romans arrived on the scene. Egypt was conquered by the Persians in 525 BC. It briefly regained its independence from Persia in 404, but was reconquered again in 343.

[Alexander the Great captured Egypt during his war with the Persians in 332](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-during-the-Greek-invasion-of-Egypt). He made an obvious effort to present himself as a friend of Egyptians and an enemy of their Persian enemies, so he was welcomed.

The family of his general [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter) ruled Egypt for the next three centuries as mixed Greek and Egyptian state — the national government and army were almost exclusively Greek, but local government and the traditional Egyptian temples were run mostly by Egyptians. This Greco-Egyptian state did fight several wars with other parts of the Greek world, with a variety of wins and losses — whether you count that as “Egypt” winning or losing wars is debatable.

When the Romans arrived, the kingdom of the Ptolemies was starting to fall apart — it was short of money, heavily corrupt, and had a series of civil wars between rival claimants to the throne. The famous Cleopatra was the last queen of this dynasty — but she owed her position in part to having defeated her own brother in one civil war and chasing her younger sister out of the country in another. Different factions among in the royal family fought against (or alongside) the Romans on a few occasions, but in their shaky state they were never successful. After Cleopatra sided with the wrong side in a Roman civil war Egypt became part of the Roman empire, and remained so for the next six hundred years.
