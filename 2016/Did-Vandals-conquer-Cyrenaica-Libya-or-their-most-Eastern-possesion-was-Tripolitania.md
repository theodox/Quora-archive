By the time of Belisarius invasion in 535, at least, the Tripolitania was the Vandal frontier — part of Belisarius’ strategy was to support a rebel movement in Tripolitania lead by a local notable named Pudentius (Procopius _Bello Vandalico III.x)_  Apparently the Vandals also had trouble with tribes from the interior: Procopius also says that before the war the tribes from the interior had destroyed Leptis Magna, which suggests that Vandal control east of the province of Africa proper was far from complete (the Vandals also seem to have had a hard time staying on good terms with the Mauretanians to their west).

Cyrenaica belonged to the [Diocese of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Egypt) and thus to the eastern Empire. Interfering with it would have put the Vandals into direct confrontation with the the east. They generally avoided antagonizing Constantinople when possible, focusing their raids and piracy on the western Mediterranean. The main exception was the war of 467–8 when emperor Leo organized a joint east-west invasion of Africa which nearly succeeded, only to collapse disastrously at the [battle of Cap Bon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cap_Bon_(468)).
