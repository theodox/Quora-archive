I think the general trend in the answers is correct: direct combat wounds were rendered vastly more lethal by artillery first and foremost -- so the the availability of better medical treatments (not only antibiotics although that's the biggest single one) would have been a far bigger lifesaver.

So I'd just add to [Jimmy Liu's ](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jimmy-Liu-51)answer with a few more pics. The images sometimes look hokey to us but the people involved were desperately aware of the stakes -- they just lost a race against the rapidly growing power of offensive weapons (particularly artillery, which alone accounted for about 2/3 of all combad casualties). The limitations of available materials ands manufacturing techniques make for some unintended comedy -- but the background is to horrible to dwell on.

Here's some other examples of WWI era efforts at bulletproofing

French -- the goggles are 'splinter goggles' to protect against shrapnel. Bulletrproof glass was only just becoming available -- it was actually used in millions of gasmasks:

A tankers mask. The tank, of course, was the ultimate development of "armor".
