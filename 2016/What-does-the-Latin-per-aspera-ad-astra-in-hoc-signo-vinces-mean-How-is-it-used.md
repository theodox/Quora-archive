That's a conflation of two different famous mottos.

_per aspera ad astra_  means "to the stars in spite of hardships" It's usually written _ad astra per aspera_  though:

_In Hoc Signo Vinces_  mean "in this sign you shall be victorious". It's the words which came to Roman emperor Constantine on the eve of [the battle of the Milvian Bridge, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Milvian_Bridge)which sealed his claim to the throne. Believing it to be a message from the Christian God he formally ended the Roman persecution of Christians after his victory. You see it abbreviated IHS in lots of places, usually associated with a cross or crucifix although what Constantine saw in his vision was a Chi-Ro, the Greek monogram for Christ:
