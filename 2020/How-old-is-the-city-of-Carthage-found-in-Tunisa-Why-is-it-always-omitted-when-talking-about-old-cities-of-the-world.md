The founding of Carthage is traditionally dated to 814 BC ( “38 years before the first Olympiad”, as the Greek historian put it). That’s not particularly old — a city like Thebes in Egypt had been inhabited for 2400 years at that point. There are a couple of cities in the Levant which show evidences of habitation as far back as 7500 BC, and Jericho is sometimes dated to 9000 BC.

In fact Carthage in Phoenician is ___Qart Hadasht, “New City.”___
