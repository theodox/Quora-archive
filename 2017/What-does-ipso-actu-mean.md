“Ipso facto” is a common phrase meaning literally “by that particular happening” or, in less awkward English “for that reason”.

I have never run into _ipso actu_  but grammatically it will come out almost the same : “by that very action” or because of that act”.

In Medieval Latin _actus_  has a specific technical meaning: it refers to the final form of something, its natural end: the flower is the actus of a seed. So in a medieval context ipso actu would be something like “in virtue of that essence” or “because of that nature”
