Maybe... sorta... kinda... I would not say that Pax smells noticeably worse than Comicon, for example. However I've worked quite a few PAX's and the jokes about hygiene are perhaps a little too widespread to be entirely ignored even if its obviously an unkind generalization. 

The crowd at the show tends to skew pretty heavily towards folks who are not in their prime "attention to details of personal grooming" period : it's got a lot of the same hygienic qualities as a college dorm, because it's got a lot of the same people in it. It's not a meeting of the Rotary club.

Besides, PAX is a chance for folks from nerd-poor areas to immerse themselves (figuratively, and almost literally on the more crowded days) in Gamer culture. If you can't find anybody in your zip code who plays _Pathfinder,_  it's totally understandable that you'd be happy to camp out in a corner of the convention center for a marathon role-playing session. Unfortunately 12 hours of hunching over a dice cup in a crowded space tends to raise a bit of a fug (in the very old days, back at the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue before the show went big time it used to be quite dangerous trying to navigate the hallways since there were so many people sprawled out over heaps of Magic cards or rows of Warhammer figures -- nowadays, at least, a lot of the action is at tables!)

Last but not least, there's a lot of cosplayers. And despite the glamour factor, the average cosplayer is not a willowy part-time model in a chainmail bikini: it's more likely to be a husky dude in a hot, poorly ventilated home-made set of Spartan IV armor. Even the most meticulous attention to hygiene is not likely to defeat the insulating effects of foam rubber, duct tape, or a Firefly-style duster coat.
