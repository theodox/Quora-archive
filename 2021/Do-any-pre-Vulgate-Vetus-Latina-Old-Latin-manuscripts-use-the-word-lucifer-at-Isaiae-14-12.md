Yes — with thanks to [David West](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-West-27) in the comments, who found an [online copy](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Vetus_latina/jrDYAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=lucifer) of the VL (Gryson, 1949). Gryson provides two variants of the line (the first in African readings, the second European ones)

> [African] quomodo cecidit de caelo lucifer mane oriens contritus est in terra qui mittit ad omnes gentes

> [European] quomodo de caelo cecidit lucifer qui mane oriebatur confractus ad terram qui inmittebat ad cunctas nationes

The vulgate line is

> quomodo cecidisti de caelo lucifer qui mane oriebaris corruisti in vulnerabas gentes

As guessed, “lucifer” is the easy translation of ἑωσφόρος. I left the original answer below (it looks, incidentally, like Rufinus was using the second variation above)



__Original guess:__ 

It’s hard to find one online (the latest edition would be the 1990 one from Roger Grysom, according the [vetuslatina.org](http://www.vetuslatina.org/))

However if you check the Septuagint, the passage in Greek is :

> πῶς ἐξέπεσεν ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ὁ __ἑωσφόρος__ ὁ πρωὶ ἀνατέλλων συνετρίβη εἰς τὴν γῆν ὁ ἀποστέλλων πρὸς πάντα τὰ ἔθνη

ἑωσφόρος or “dawn light”, that is, the morning star, would almost certainly be rendered in Latin as “lucifer”. Since the Vetus Latina was a semi-pro translation of the LXX (at best!) it’s a safe bet. There might be more here:



But unfortunately it’s paywalled. The visible part mentions that manuscripts of this particular book are quite rare.



__Bonus round.__  [Spencer McDaniel](https://www.quora.com/profile/Spencer-McDaniel-11) sent me a picture of the paywalled article above, and alas no dice. A little digging however did turn up the fact that Jerome was very familiar with Origen’s [On First Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_First_Principles) and the Latin translation thereof by Rufinus — which comments on this passage. Rufinus also used “Lucifer” here:

> et de Nabuchodonosor, ex quae multis in locis ab scriptura dicuntur, et maxime in Isaia, quomodo possibile est nos dicta de homine suscipere? Neque enim homo is qui dicitur “_cecidisse de coelo”,_ vel “_qui Lucifer fuit”_ vel “_qui mane oriebatur.”_ 

> And how could we possibly accept, as spoken of a man, what is related in many passages of Scripture, and especially in Isaiah, regarding Nebuchadnezzar? For he is not a man who is said “to have fallen from heaven”, or “who was Lucifer”, or “who arose in the morning.”

(Latin here & Greek [here](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Patrologiae_cursus_completus_series_grae/qAkRAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=lucifer), English [here;](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04124.htm) I added quotation marks for clarity)

This looks a bit different from the Vulgate, which was still about five years from publication at the time . Jerome has “_Quomodo cecidisti de caelo, Lucifer, qui mane oriebaris?_ ” but Rufinus’ changes to the endings are just the way Latin handles indirect discourse — It’s likely that Rufinus version of the text was the same as Jerome’s. It certainly uses “Lucifer,” and Rufinus and Jerome would not agree on anything unless they had to.

It took a long time for Lucifer, the devil, to displace Lucifer, the morning star in Latin. Here’s a 10th century diagram from Isidore of Sevilles’ _De Natura Rerum_ showing the geocentric cosmos; as you can see the planets include Mercurius, Lucifer, Sol (the sun) Vesper (Mars), Foeton (Jupiter) and Saturnus. Isidore’s book was a standard encyclopedia for many medieval libraries into the 14th century.
