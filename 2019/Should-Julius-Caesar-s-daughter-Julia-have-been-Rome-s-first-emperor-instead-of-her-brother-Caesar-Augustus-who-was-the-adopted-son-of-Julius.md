Although Octavian (not yet “Augustus”) was Caesar’s heir, he did not inherit the post of emperor. He inherited a lot of Caesar’s money and, more importantly, the political and military support of Caesar’s veterans. He made himself emperor by using those veterans to raise a private army, betraying the Senate in company with Marc Antony, and then turning on Antony and establishing himself as the last warlord standing after nearly a century of civil wars.

Julia, in any case, was already dead: she died in 54 BC, well before Julius himself, and a generation before Octavian turned himself into Augustus. Her death did actually help to create the empire, since her marriage to Pompey (in 59) had been one of the most important bonds between the two rival generals; when she died their partnership began to fall apart.

There would not be an actual empress regnant in the Roman empire until [Irene of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_of_Athens), about 800 years later. It took a lot of social change to establish both the idea of hereditary rule of any kind and also the kind of dynastic and institutional loyalties that could support a woman on the throne. [Almost no Roman emperors actually inherited the throne](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires) in any case — the Roman empire was as meritocratic as a Mafia family, and like a Mafia family success at the top tended to require both a lot of native ability and a level of ruthlessness that are very rare in children of privilege.
