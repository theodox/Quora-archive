Unless you want to count natural shrines (caves or grottos) the answer is [Göbekli Tepe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe) in Turkey. The site back to at least 9000 BC — it’s more than twice as old as the invention of writing, a mere five millennia ago. It’s also older than any known city except [Jericho,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho) which was a village with under a hundred dwellings around the same time.

The discovery of the site in 1994 upended a lot of theories about the origins of civilization; it appears that people were able to perform incredible feats of engineering and construction before they’d even completely settled down to agriculture, much less in urban settings.
