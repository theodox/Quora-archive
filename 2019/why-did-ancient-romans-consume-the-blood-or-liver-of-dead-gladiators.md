[Pliny ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plin.+Nat.+28.2&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137)uses drinking human blood to open his chapter on the medicinal uses of the human body and its byproducts:

> Epileptic patients are in the habit of drinking the blood even of gladiators, draughts teeming with life, as it were; a thing that, when we see it done by the wild beasts even, upon the same arena, inspires us with horror at the spectacle! And yet these persons, indeed, consider it a most effectual cure for their disease, to quaff the warm, breathing, blood from man himself, and, as they apply their mouth to the wound, to draw forth his very life; and this, though it is regarded as an act of impiety to apply the human lips to the wound even of a wild beast! Others there are, again, who make the marrow of the leg-bones, and the brains of infants, the objects of their research

He is however entirely disgusted by these kinds of practices:

> To examine human entrails is deemed an act of impiety; what then must it be to devour them?

> Say, Osthanes , who was it that first devised these practices; for it is you that I accuse, you who uproot all human laws, you inventor of these monstrosities — devised, no doubt, with just so that mankind might not forget your name!

Pliny goes on to speculate that the use of human tissue and blood originated among “barbarians,” without being more specific. The “Osthanes” he cites was supposedly a Persian or Median _magus_ , a wise man — although many different works were attributed to him and it was probably kind of pen-name for and alchemical writers in the Hellenistic period.

Modern readers will notice that many of the practices Pliny cites in his denunciation sound an awful lot like [sympathetic magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_magic#Similarity_and_contagion): the idea that the desired medical effects can be achieved by a sort of magical contagion. In Pliny’s opening example the epileptics evidently believed that “the warm breathing blood of life itself” conferred vitality. In another of this examples toothaches could be cured by scratching the gums with the extracted tooth of an unburied corpse to “deaden” the pain. This kind of [magical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking) is extremely common in folk magic across many cultures and times.

To our eyes the line between magic and Greco-Roman medicine is still rather blurry: many of the remedies which Pliny records are based on similarly “magical” ideas of contagion or correspondence. However polite Greek and Roman society was [aghast at things like ritual murder and cannibalism](https://www.quora.com/How-common-was-human-sacrifice-in-the-Greek-and-the-Roman-Empire): Pliny clearly sees consumption of human tissue or blood as a relic of barbarism, superstition, and impiety.

> Far from us, far too from our writings, be such prescriptions as these! It will be for us to describe remedies only, and not abominations

While he will go on to describe things like using urine as a remedy for sunburn. He shies away from morbid practices involving human body parts, cadavers, and necromancy. His condemnations of the uses of human body parts in medicine are very similar in language and style to his [discussion of human sacrifice](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D30%3Achapter%3D4).

In short — this is a good example of why “the Romans” is far too broad a category for understanding a practice like this. Romans of all sorts shared elements of the folk-magic world view, but the educated classes at least also recognized the disconnect between such practices and what they believed to be civilized morality. Pliny was writing at a period when the suppression of these kinds of “barbarian” superstition was seen and a central part of Rome’s civilizing mission: he was writing within a decade or so of the imperial edict which banned Druidism in large part because the Druids practiced human sacrifices.
