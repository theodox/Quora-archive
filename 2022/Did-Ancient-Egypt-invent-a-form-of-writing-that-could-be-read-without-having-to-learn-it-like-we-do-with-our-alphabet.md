They did eventually ‚Äî but it was the end of a process of evolution that took thousands of years.

Over about 3,500 years Egyptian was written with four different scripts.

There famous __hieroglyphic__  system is the most famous and the oldest, but early on (as far back as the first dynasty) Egyptians developed a cursive script that was faster to write and better suited for use on papyrus. This was known as __[Hieratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieratic)__ ____ and it was was actually much more common than hieroglyphics. However it was just as complicated as hieroglyphics and really only made sense to someone who was literate in hieroglyphics ‚Äî both systems used the same mix of ideographs and rebus-writing, the only real difference was the letter forms and the use of a brush pen.

Over the next millennium and a half, the two scripts remained the same but the way they were used changed. Rebus-writing ‚Äî using the sound of a pictographic sign as part of a larger word you want to ‚Äúspell‚Äù ‚Äî was always part of hieroglyphic and hieratic writing, but as the centuries passed it became more and more common and more standardized. Later text relied more and more on conventional ‚Äúspelling‚Äù which used a subset of the signs.

Around the end of the New Kingdom (roughly, the 25th dynasty or the beginning of the Iron Age, around 2600 years ago, a new script emerged. For more than a millennium, spoken Egyptian had evolved away from the language preserved in the conservative hieroglyphic / hieratic tradition. By the early Iron Age the language used in hieroglyphic texts was as distinct from the language of the streets as Italian is from Latin. Ordinary Egyptians turned increasingly to a new script based on Hieratic but adapted to everyday speech: one we know as __[Demotic](https://www.arce.org/resource/demotic-history-development-and-techniques-ancient-egypts-popular-script)__ __.__ Egyptians called it _sekh shat_  or ‚Äúdocument writing‚Äù because it was used for any written purpose, compared to the formal contexts of hieratic and hieroglyphic writing.

Although demotic was descended from hieratic writing, the connection is only really obvious in retrospect: if you didn‚Äôt know that the two scripts were parent and child you‚Äôd be hard put to spot the connections.

Demotic developed in an atmosphere were other alphabetic scripts were already common ‚Äî notably Aramaic, the administrative tool of the Assyrians and the Persians (itself, a distant descendant of the hieroglyphics of a thousand years before). So, it moved even farther in the direction of ‚Äúspelling.‚Äù In a Demotic document, almost half the characters are purely ‚Äúspelled‚Äù; conceptual characters make up the rest but many of them are ‚Äúhelpers,‚Äù like the stylized descendant of the old hieroglyph ìÄÄ indicating a male personal name is being spelled. Actual ideograms ‚Äî signs indicating a complete idea ‚Äî are comparatively rare. However Demotic evolved with some older spellings in mind; it had a number of stylized sequences or ligatures which represented common spellings in the older scripts: as a rough analogy, you could imagine if common word roots from Latin became ‚Äúletters‚Äù in our alphabet.* This helped with speed of composition but made Demotic harder to learn than a pure alphabet.

By the time the Greeks arrived in Egypt (336 BC) Demotic was firmly entrenched as the normal medium of Egyptian writing. Hieroglyphic and hieratic writing continued for prestige purposes but, like Latin in 19th century Europe, they were highly formalized and most people did not know them. Egyptians who read the Rosetta Stone almost certainly skipped to the Demotic section.

After the Romans took over from the Greeks (32 BC), Demotic lost ground. The new Roman administration retained the prior Greek legal system but gradually stopped supporting the parallel native one ‚Äî Demotic contracts, for example, lost their legal force unless accompanied by a Greek translation. This obliged a lot of Egyptians to learn Greek for practical and business purposes, and the result was the final Egyptian writing system, what we now know as __[Coptic](https://omniglot.com/writing/coptic.htm)__ . By the third century of our era the Coptic script , a version of the Greek alphabet with a few extra characters adopted from Demotic for uniquely Egyptian sounds, has become the primary way of writing Egyptian. All three of the older systems diminished quite rapidly and by the end of the fifth century or so had fallen out of use. Coptic is purely alphabetic and has only 32 characters, in contrast to the hundreds of common Demotic signs. Although Coptic is no longer an everyday writing system in Egypt (having been displaced by Arabic) it survives in the liturgy of the Coptic Church.
