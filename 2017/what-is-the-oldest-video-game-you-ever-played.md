Video? We don’t need no steenking _video!_ 

My first computer game was [Trek 73](http://www.kermitmurray.com/trek73/), a Star Trek simulator, played on a teletype terminal the Livermore Science Center. Each turn you would type in a command, which would get sent to the mainframe for processing. The resulting updated map would get printed out on the teletype (as I recall it took about a minute and a half, meaning the framerate was approximately 0.011111111 FPS)

But check out these __amazing graphics__ :

You can get a sense of the game flow in this video, although it’s really not the same without 30 feet of hole-punched continuous-feed paper:



If you want to kick it old school you can get the DOS version [here](http://www.kermitmurray.com/trek73/trek73-software/dos-version/) and play it on a DOS emulator; there’s also a C# port [here](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/28228/Star-Trek-1971-Text-Game) of a slightly older version.

It will make you appreciate even Clash of Clans.
