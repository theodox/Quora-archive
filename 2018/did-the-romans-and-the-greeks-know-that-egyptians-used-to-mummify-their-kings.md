Yes, the knowledge of Egyptian embalming goes way back — Herodotus wrote about the process as far back as around 500 BC. The practice of mummification was still going on throughout the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, and it became [popular with some Greeks and Romans](https://mikedashhistory.com/2014/12/16/the-fayum-mummy-portraits/).

Here’s a Greek mummy (note the chaplet of leaves around the head). In addition to the Egyptianate decorations there’s a Greek inscription on the case reading “farewell, Artemidoros”.

Most of these mummies are found in the [Fayum basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayum_mummy_portraits), a site with religious roots going back to the Middle Kingdom. In the later Ptolemaic and then the Roman periods Egyptian religion was voguish among the Greek and Roman upper classes (there has even been a [mummy found in Greece](https://www.livescience.com/2730-greek-mummy-lead-coffin.html)).

Here’s an amazing example of a Roman-era melange of Greek, Roman and Egyptian funeral art:
