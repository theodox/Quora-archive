Not exactly.

As a member of the senatorial class it was expected that Caesar would have a significant military career. But, like many young aristocrats he bypassed the ordinary ranks and began his career as what Romans called a _legatus_ and we’d call an [aide-de-camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aide-de-camp). Caesar’s first military experience was for [Marcus Minucius Thermus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Minucius_Thermus), the Roman governor of Asia Minor, in 81 BC — probably because Caesar’s father had governed the province and his family connections there were seen as politically useful. As part of Thermus’ staff he was liable for all sorts of duty, from scouting and intelligence work to diplomacy (the [long standing rumors about Caesar and king Nicomedes of Bithynia](https://www.quora.com/Did-Julius-Caesar-have-a-homosexual-affair-with-King-Nicomedes?ch=10&share=f978df4c&srid=zLvM) date from a diplomatic posting there at during this period).

Depending on the individual this kind of privileged position could either be very light duty or a crash course in the realities of war. In Caesar’s case it was the latter — he won the _[corona civica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Crown#:~:text=The%20Civic%20Crown%20(Latin%3A%20corona,woven%20to%20form%20a%20crown.)_ _,_ the second-highest award Roman award for valor, at the siege of Mytilene in 81. Given the fact that Caesar was tied to the losing faction in Roman politics at the time this must reflect a genuine exploit rather than a political favor.

The semi-formal way Roman aristocrats related to the military is neatly illustrated by the [famous story of Caesar’s capture by pirates (a few years later, in 75)](https://www.quora.com/Was-Julius-Caesar-really-captured-by-pirates/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=5d515bf7&srid=zLvM). After he was ransomed Caesar personally led a naval detachment back to the pirate lair to take revenge on his captors, despite having no formal military appointment — he was, in fact, more or less in exile at the time. But his family had ties to the region and he was able to convince the local authorities to loan him a personal flotilla. Caesar was still in the east the next year, when [Mithridates of Pontus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_VI#Mithridatic_Wars) attacked the brand-new Roman province of Bithynia — the homeland of Caesar’s old friend Nicomedes, who had died childless and left his country to the care of Rome. Caesar raised a private army on his own initiative and protected Roman allies in Asia — probably with the blessing of the Roman governor but basically again with no real authority beyond a recognizable name and an outsized personality.

Caesar’s first _regular_ military role outside the ranks of gentleman volunteers was in 72, when he returned to Rome and was elected military tribune, a rough analogy for what we’d call a “colonel”. However his service there must not have been very interesting since it doesn’t leave any good stories in the record, unlike his informal career as a gentleman of fortune in the east. His first regular independent command was in 61 when he was governor (and thus military commander in chief) of Hispania Ulterior (Portugal and part of Spain).



(note that I’ve simplified the confusion around the dates here — there are some contradictions in the sources which are very hard to resolve. Details [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40929482) for the purists.
