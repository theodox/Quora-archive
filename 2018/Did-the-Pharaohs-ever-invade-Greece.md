Only if you count Persian emperor [Xerxes,](http://www.ancient-egypt-online.com/xerxes-I.html) who was nominally the Pharaoh of Egypt, which had been conquered two reigns earlier by Persian emperor [Cambyses.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambyses_II) When Xerxes invaded Greece in 480 BC, his fleet included about 200 triremes (war-galleys) from Egypt — about 40,000 men, more or less. However the overwhelming majority of his forces came from other parts of the Persian empire.

There is a minority school of thought, championed by the late Marin Bernal, which claims that during the Bronze Age Greece was essentially an Egyptian colony. There are definitely some legends which claim [Egyptian ancestry for the semi-mythical royal house of Argos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegyptus); it is barely possible that these reflect some kind of Egyptian presence in Bronze Age Greece. However this is not a generally accepted view (there’s more on it in [this question](https://www.quora.com/What-if-any-is-the-part-of-truth-to-Martin-Bernals-Black-Athenahttps://www.quora.com/What-if-any-is-the-part-of-truth-to-Martin-Bernals-Black-Athena)).
