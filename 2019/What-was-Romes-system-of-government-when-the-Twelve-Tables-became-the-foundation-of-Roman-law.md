The twelve tables are from the dim mists of the early Republic; they are tentatively dated to the middle of the fifth century B.C., around 50–60 years after the foundation of the republic and the expulsion of the Tarquins.

Unfortunately the sources for this period are very hazy— Romans didn’t really start writing history for another couple of centuries— do the dating (and everything else about the tables) relies on oral traditions and later conjectures whose accuracy we can’t really assess. However it’s probably correct to assume, as later writers did, that the codification of the tables was a part of the political struggles surrounding the [Conflict of the Orders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_the_Orders) between the Patricians and the Plebeians; in antiquity written law codes are usually a populist policy that limits the power of traditional aristocrats.
