Realistically none of those is ideal — all three languages have automatic garbage collection, which makes them easier to code in but prone to unpredictable slowdowns.

Out of the three however the best bet is to use c# along with [Unity](https://unity3d.com), which has a c++ core but allows you write game code in c#. Unity also has a vibrant community which will make it easier to find advice and answers.

There’s something similar for python in [panda3d](https://www.panda3d.org). Python isnt perfect for high performance games but it’s a good language for learning and it’s fine for small projects.
