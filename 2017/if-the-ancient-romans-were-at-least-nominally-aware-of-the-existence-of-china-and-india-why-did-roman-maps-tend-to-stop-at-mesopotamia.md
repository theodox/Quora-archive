# If the ancient Romans were at least nominally aware of the existence of China and India, why did Roman maps tend to stop at Mesopotamia?

It’s really a data collection problem. They didn’t have compasses or — very important! — accurate clocks, or even Renaissance-era surveying tools.

Outside of the Roman world (where it was possible to coordinate observations pretty carefully) the only thing a Roman map-maker had to go on was travellers’ estimates of sailing, walking or riding distances between landmarks and very rough guesses about latitude. Longitude, alas, was basically unsolvable for them because they didn’t have portable mechanical clocks[; reliable estimation of longitude didn’t really get solved until the 1700s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude).)

Given enough data they were able to smooth out some of the obvious errors, which is why maps inside the Roman world were pretty good:

_the red lines are the offsets between the Ptolemy world map of the 2d c. and their real locations. As you can see the east-west errors are much larger than the north-south ones. Lots of great detail_ _[here](http://members.casema.nl/h.vandeukeren/histotron/ptol_index.htm)_ 

However the farther you got from home the more those errors compounded. Moreover the less likely it was that your data was coming from an educated gentleman with a mathematical bent, and the more likely it was coming from a semi-literate trader or sailor. The data got both less dense and a lot sketchier the farther you went from home.

The other problem was a very practical one: the Parthians and the Sassanids in Persia were very, very keen on maintaining their lucrative monopoly on the Silk Road. They were definitely not going to let a Roman survey party pass through their territory on its way to China or India. The main reason the Romans had any maps of India and China at all is that they started [sailing to India directly across the Indian Ocean](https://www.quora.com/I-have-heard-that-ancient-Greece-and-Rome-were-having-trades-with-south-Indian-kingdoms-But-in-history-why-werent-these-given-much-importance-and-not-talked-about). The handful of Romans who actually made it to China didn’t go overland - they[ sailed around to the Bay of Bengal and then up the Irrawady](https://www.quora.com/When-and-where-did-the-first-direct-contact-between-Han-China-and-Rome-occur) . Unfortunately for cartography, that’s a pretty complex route to record for people without compasses or clocks.

Since the distant data came from traders, it also focuses on places that long-distance traders wanted to visit. Ancient trade focused on portable, high-value commodities, not bulk, so the rural hinterlands of any distant place were not of much interest. So most of the places Romans heard about in India were on the coasts; and in China they were along the river routes that led up from Burma.

Interestingly the data for Afghanistan is less sketchy, thanks largely to the the remnants of the [Greco-Bactrian Kingdom ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom)and the [Indo-Greek Kingdom ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek_Kingdom), both of which ultimately derived from Alexander the Great’s career in the east. Although these both disappeared as independent polities in the first century they retained cultural ties with the mediterranean world. There’s some evidence that, while they lasted, these outposts kept up with scientific developments back home — for example this sundial from [Ai-Khanoum ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai-Khanoum)in northern Afghanistan. Presumably this meant a better quality of observations could make their way back to Alexandria, which was the hub of Roman cartography.

Lastly it’s worth pointing out that the map-as-birds-eye-view was a fairly academic pursuit. For practical purposes the Romans preferred [itineraria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itinerarium) — strip maps designed to guide travellers along the Roman road-and-shipping network in the manner of a modern subway map rather than providing accurate ‘pictures’ of the earth.

It’s probably worth closing from [this bit of the geographer Strabo’s account of India](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D15#note-link93):

> The reader must receive the account of this country with indulgence, for it lies at a very great distance, and few persons of our nation have seen it; those also who have visited it have seen only some portions of it; the greater part of what they relate is from report, and even what they saw, they became acquainted with during their passage through the country with an army, and in great haste. For this reason they do not agree in their accounts of the same things, although they write about them as if they had examined them with the greatest care and attention. Some of these writers were fellow-soldiers and fellow-travellers, as those who belonged to the army which, under the command of Alexander, conquered Asia; yet they frequently contradict each other. If, then, they differ so much respecting things which they had seen, what must we think of what they relate from report?
