One part of this is the fact that the habit of [primogeniture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture) - leaving everything to the eldest (male) heir - is actually a pretty late invention. The Romans didn't practice it (see [Why was the Roman succession so violent? Why weren't they able to establish a functional succession system like other large empires?](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires)) and neither did the Carolingians or Merovingians in Gaul. 

Succession by primogeniture seems 'natural' to us but that's only because the practice was so widespread between the 12th and the 19th centuries. So it wan't an unusual case -- any more than a modern parent dividing their estate equally among all of their children would be surprising. The 'classical' European practice is the actual anomaly.
