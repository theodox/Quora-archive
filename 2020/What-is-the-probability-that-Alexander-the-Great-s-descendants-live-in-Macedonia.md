Unfortunately, it’s __zero__ .

Alexander only had one legitimate son, [Alexander IV](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/alexander-iv/) and one illegitimate one, [Heracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles_of_Macedon). Both were murdered 309 BC, during the wars which tore Alexander’s empire apart after his death.
