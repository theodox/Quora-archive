# King Servius Tullius divided the Roman population in tribes, or tribuses. He divided them in urban and rural tribes. My question is: "What does one mean when one says "rural" tribe (when talking about the city of Rome back in the sixth century BC)?"

The word “tribes” (Latin [tribus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_tribe)) had a special technical meaning in Rome. They were basically voting districts, not kinship groups or independent political units.

Roman legend attributed the first division of the city into tribes to king[ Servius Tullius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servius_Tullius), who generally gets credit for the origins of the Roman constitution. Supposedly he began with thirty tribes, but in historic times this was more like twenty in the early republic, rising to thirty five by the first century BC.

The tribes were originally based on place of residence. Four of the first twenty were urban, located within the physical limits of the city. The other sixteen were dispersed around the rest of Roman territory — these were the rural tribes mentioned on the question. As time went on more tribes were created but the link to a physical location became less concrete: many Roman citizens were the aristocrats of other Italian communities, given Roman rights as a reward for loyal service to Rome, while other Roman citizens moved abroad into new colonies, losing their link to neighborhoods or towns in Latium. Eventually enrollment in a “tribe” became more of a bureaucratic fiction than a practical reality.

The four urban tribes originated as urban wards within the city — they began as essentially vici or neighborhoods. Like all tribes this geographic association weakened over time, but due to their early association with the physical center of Rome they were eventually came to v seen as the natural home of the lower classes— most freedmen ended up in the urban tribes. Since Roman voting was done en-bloc, this limited the political power of the poor urban masses: the four urban tribes were easily outvoted by the rural ones. This was a commonly acknowledged aspect of Roman politics which most conservative ancient commenters viewed as a valuable feature.

It’s important to remember that the Servian tribes are semi-legendary: the descriptions in our sources are at least three centuries later than the nominal date of the not-necessarily-historical Servius. However in all later accounts the Servian constitution was seen as a consistently “[timocratic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timocracy)” system based on graduated political rights assigned on the basis of wealth. In that context any reference to the urban tribes is probably emphasizing the way in which the tribal voting system was weighted to favor the rural districts dominated by large landowners. There are good reasons to think that’s a middle-Republican theory more than a pre-republican reality, but that’s the essence of the reference.
