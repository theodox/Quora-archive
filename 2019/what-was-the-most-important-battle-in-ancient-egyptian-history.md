There are a lot of candidates to choose from — five millennia gives you a big back catalog. However there’s really only one which qualifies as a Hollywood-style, end-of-the-world blockbluster: the [battle of the Delta ](https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-important-events/battle-delta-ramses-iii-saves-egypt-people-sea-003119https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-important-events/battle-delta-ramses-iii-saves-egypt-people-sea-003119)in year 8 of Rameses III: our 1175 BC*.

This was a battle which you can describe with a straight face as “saving civilization.”

[The 12th century BC was a chaotic time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse). For reasons that are still unclear to us, every major civilization of the Near East was in crisis between about 1225 and 1175 BC. The Hittite empire, Anatolia, Mycenaean Greece, Crete, Cyprus, and the city states of the Levant all show widespread destruction, depopulation, and refugee flows. The mighty Assyrian empire was compressed back into to its ancient heartland. The destruction of Troy is now usually seen as a sideshow of this apocalyptic era. There’s a reason that the most recent popular history of this period is titled __[1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed.](https://www.amazon.com/1177-B-C-Civilization-Collapsed-Turning/dp/0691168385)__

__Sea Peoples__ 

The 12th century chaos came to Egypt in Rameses’ eighth year.

Egypt faced a two-pronged invasion by the “[Sea Peoples](https://www.quora.com/Where-did-the-Sea-Peoples-the-people-who-invaded-Greece-Egypt-and-the-Hittite-Empire-in-the-Late-Bronze-Age-come-from/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=4354e5a4&srid=zLvM)” — a shadowy coalition of enemies whose origins and motives are not clear to us. These Sea Peoples — or as Rameses called them, the “Nine Bows” — are obscure to us, but in the 12th century BC they were a real threat. This poorly understood group is implicated in the overthrow of almost every urban center between Asia Minor and Egypt in the years 1250–1175.

Looking at the shattered states and cities of the eastern Mediterranean it’s easy to see why any Pharaoh looking northward had reason to be nervous. As our main source for these events, [Rameses III’s funerary temple at Medinet Habu](https://www.ancient-egypt-online.com/medinet-habu.html),** puts it:

> Not one stood before their hands, from Kheta, Kode, Carchemish, Arvad, Alashia, they were wasted. [They set up] a camp in one place in Amor. They desolated his people and his land like that which is not. They came with fire prepared before them, forward to Egypt. Their main support was Peleset, Tjekker, Shekelesh, Denyen, and Weshesh. (These) lands were united, and they laid their hands upon the land as far as the Circle of the Earth. Their hearts were confident, full of their plans.

__Prelude: war in Canaan__ 

Rameses says the attackers came south from [Amurru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amurru_kingdom) (the land of the biblical Amorites — what we’d called coastal Syria) along the coastal road into the traditional Egyptian protectorate of Canaan. According to Rameses, the Egyptians mustered their forces and marched off to battle in [Djahi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Djahy) — what we would today call the Jordan River valley.

In Rameses’ account the Egyptians handily defeated the invaders:

> Those who reached my boundary, their seed is not; their heart and soul are finished forever and ever

_The Pharoah (right) battling the invaders in Djahi, from the Medinet Habu reliefs. In a few places you can see the enemy forces are in ox-drawn carts — a key piece of evidence for the idea that this was a massive invasion and not just a typical border conflict. Illustration:_ _[Oriental Institute](https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/oip8.pdf)_ 

Unfortunately there’s a catch: Egyptian inscriptions never record a defeat. We know from archaeology that most of the Egyptian garrisons of Canaan were filled with Peleset — that is, the people known today as [Philistines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philistines) — in the later part of Rameses’ reign. We are also certain that within a few decades these former invaders were the dominant power in southern Canaan, and the archaeological record does not make it look like they were under firm Egyptian control.

So, one of two things happened in Djahy, though it’s hard to be sure which. It’s possible that the campaign was actually a defeat, disguised in our sources by propaganda meant for domestic consumption. In this telling the “captives” were actually the victors, and the Pharaoh gave them land in Canaan in return for face-saving recognition of Egyptian authority. It’s also possible that the Ramses did win in Canaan — [another Egyptian source](http://fontes.lstc.edu/~rklein/Doc5/harris.htm) claims that Ramses settled these former enemies there and made them into his frontier guards. So perhaps Rameses did indeed stop the landward prong of the invasion — but then realized that other elements of the Sea People coalition, living up to their name, had turned his flank and were heading for Egypt by sea.

__Climax in the Delta__ 

However it happened, the climactic confrontation took place on Egyptian soil, at one of the eastern mouths of the Nile Delta. Egypt’s survival — or destruction — would be determined amidst the papyrus reeds of the Nile shore.

Reading between the lines of the typically bombastic Egyptian inscriptions, it appears that the Pharaoh resorted to a massive mobilization. It’s noticeable that this language is not used in the description of Pharaoh’s departure for the Djahy campaign.

> I caused the Nile mouth to be prepared like I strong wall, with warships, galleys and small craft, equipped, for they were manned completely from bow to stern with valiant warriors, with their weapons; the militia, consisting of every picked man in Egypt, were like lions roaring upon the mountain top

Historically, Egyptians were not strong sailors. The predictable winds and flow of the Nile — and the lack of good timber in Egypt — discouraged them from developing a serious blue-water navy. The Sea Peoples, on the other hand, were long-haul sailors — we believe that some of their contingents came from as far off as Sardinia. The Pharaoh, therefore, did not try to stop them off shore — instead, the Egyptians concentrated their forces inside the river mouth where the invaders would have to land.

Meanwhile the army was drawn up along the shore to contest any landing and to bombard enemy ships with arrows.

> The chariotry consisted of runners , of picked men, of every good and capable chariot-warrior. Their horses were quivering in every part of their body and ready to crush.

And most important of all, at least if you’re a Pharaoh:

> I was the valiant [war god] Montu, standing fast at their head so that they might gaze upon the conquests of my two hands: King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Usermare Meriamon; son of Ra, Rameses III

Evidently the massive mobilization and the ambush at the Nile mouth provided the margin of victory.

> As for those who had assembled before them on the sea, the full flame was in their front, before the river-mouths, and a wall of metal upon the shore surrounded them. They were dragged, overturned, and laid low upon the beach; slain and made heaps from stern to bow of their galleys, while all their things were cast upon the water. (Thus) I turned back the waters to remember Egypt; when they mention my name in their land, may it consume them, while I sit upon the throne of Harakhte, and the serpent-diadem is fixed upon my head, like Re.

__Aftermath__ 

Pharaohs tended to be braggarts on an epic scale (if you take [Ramesses II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II) at his word, he defeated the entire Hittite army at Qadesh _by himself_ ). In this case, at least, Rameses III is entitled to his boasts. Wealthy and powerful states from the Black Sea to the Gaza had been destroyed, in many cases never to return; but Rameses’ victory at the Nile’s mouth meant that Egypt’s distinctive form of civilization would endure. Half a millennium later Egyptians could still walk through the massive temple he built for himself and read his boasts.

Ramses would go on to rule for another 23 years. There were still hard times ahead: with most of the world’s advanced economies in ruins, there were decades of economic hard times to come. The [world’s oldest recorded labor strike](https://libcom.org/history/records-of-the-strike-in-egypt-under-ramses-iii) came during the closing years of his reign: the workers who manned the mortuary city in the Valley of the Kings rose up against inadequate rations, perhaps a reflection of the uncertainty which followed on career of the Sea People. Egypt’s hold on Canaan — whatever it looked like after the first battle in Djahy — was completely lost by 1135.

Nonetheless, Egypt endured.

Ironically, saving the Egyptian world was no guarantee of security. In 1155, twenty years after the heroic victory at the Delta, [one of Rameses’s wives tried to have him assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harem_conspiracy) in favor of her son. Archaeologists believe his throat was cut, though the coup which was supposed to accompany the attack failed. He lived only long enough to ensure that the throne was passed to his chosen heir and organize the trials of the conspirators.

*Egyptians used regnal years, rather than serially numbered years and there are technical disagreements about the actual start of Rameses’ reign. We do know the battle took place in Year 8 of Rameses’ reign.
