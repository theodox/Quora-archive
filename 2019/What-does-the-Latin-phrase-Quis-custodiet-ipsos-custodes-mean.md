It is conventionally translated as “who watches the watchmen?” but it’s got a couple of ambiguities for the translator.

Ipsos is literally “themselves”, which emphasizes the doubt; “ who can watch the.very watchmen?” isn’t as neat in English but gets more of the tone.

The other ambiguity is that custodio and the noun custos (here “custodes” in the plural ) have a double meaning: A custos can be a guard, for example the retainer who answers the door admits people to your home is a custos. However a custos can also be a jailer or even an informer. “Watchmen” in English sits fairly neutrally in the middle of that range but this sentence could easily be rendered as “who spies in the spies?” - tending more toward paranoia than sober civic responsibility.

The paranoid version is probably closer to the correct translation — but not for the reasons you might think.

Though this phrase has been popular with jurists and political theorists for millennia, it’s _not_ a meditation on political power or civic virtue. It actually comes from the snarky Roman poet [Juvenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenal), complaining (as he did quite frequently) about __adultery__ . The august phrase, in short, is not about politics or the surveillance state — its about the fact that the domestics who are supposed to be keeping the wife from having an affair are corruptible. The in-context translation might be really be “who can chaperone the chaperones”.

> audio quid ueteres olim moneatis amici,
'pone seram, cohibe.' sed quis custodiet ipsos
custodes? cauta est et ab illis incipit uxor

> All the time I hear the warnings of my old friends:
"Bar the door, keep her in!" But _who will chaperone
the chaperones_ ? The wife plans ahead — and she starts with them.

> [Juvenal, Satire VI](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/juvenal-satvi.asp) (my translation of lines 346–348)
