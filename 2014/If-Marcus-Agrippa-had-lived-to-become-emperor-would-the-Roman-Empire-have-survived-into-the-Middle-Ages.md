At the very least, it's highly unlikely. A system that dependent on the talents of one person would not be very stable. Indeed, one one the many reasons for the decline of Rome was the inability to select for effective leadership -- given the pretty crummy odds that a given Roman emperor died in his bed, it seems inevitable that the fate of Rome did not depend too heavily on the center at all.

I'm not energetic enough to check this list:
[League table of Roman Emperors by Length of Reign](http://historum.com/ancient-history/21418-league-table-roman-emperors-length-reign.html)
against the one in Wikipedia:
[List of Roman emperors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_emperors)
But unless it's _extremely_ misleading -- a quick spot check made it look OK -- the median rule of a Roman emperor was only about __2 years__ . During the crisis of the 3d century the system was chronically unstable at the top: even famously 'successful' emperors like Diocletian had to deal with constant attempts at revolt or regime change. The 'good days' under Augustus, the Flavians, and the Antonines were the exceptions rather than the rule by a long shot.

The really amazing thing is that the Roman 'system' -- the economy, civil society, the assimilation of non-Romans into the roman Oikumene, and the maintenance of local order -- managed to survive the craziness at the top so well, and to root itself so deeply.

As an aside I'd add that there were sitting "Roman Emperors" throughout the Middle Ages, though not in the sense you mean. [Giannis Laderos](https://www.quora.com/profile/Giannis-Laderos) answer correctly points out that "Rome" in the East didn't fall until the 1500s (unless you count the claim of the Czars to be heirs of Byzantium, in which case it fell in 1917). Francis II of Austria, the last Holy Roman Emperor, dissolved the Empire as part of settling with Napoleon in 1806.
