# What was the process of using the Rosetta Stone to learn Egyptian hieroglyphs like? How did they know it was the same text as the other sections of the stone? Was there even anything to cross reference it with?

There were really four different pieces to the puzzle. Three of them had actually been floating around for a while , but only as speculations: without anything like a test case they were smart guesses but could not make the transition to be true hypotheses.

The three pre-existing ideas that made the decipherment possible were:

__The underlying language was similar to Coptic.__ This was not a particularly new hypothesis: Coptic was, after all, still the majority language in Egypt until the tenth or eleventh century and it doesn’t take a ton of imagination to assume that the language of the hieroglyphs would resemble it. Medieval Egyptian scholars assumed as much, and Champollion did as well. The counter-tradition — [going all the way back to misleading Greek texts from the fourth century ](https://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/hh/hh003.htm)— was that the Hieroglyphs were a sort of symbolic universal language that anyone could understand: this was a popular theory in the Renaissance, the most famous example being the [energetic fantasies of Athanasius Kircher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Aegyptiacus). But even Kircher learned Coptic as part of his effort to understand the hieroglyphs.

__That the different texts on the stone said the same thing.__ This seems to have been obvious to everyone studying the stone: even Napoleon himself, when he was first shown the stone, said “There appears no doubt that the column which bears the hieroglyphs contains the same inscription as the other two, thus, here is a means of acquiring certain information of this, until now, unintelligible language.”

Ironically this is not exactly true: the two Egyptian versions are essentially the same data as the Greek text but not actually word-for-word translations at all — a fact that tripped up some of the first Europeans to try to decipher the stone. You can actually see parallel modern translations [here](http://rosettastone.hieroglyphic-texts.net/part_320/) to get a sense of the differences.

__That the script was at least partly alphabetic.__ This was a guess of many scholars — the Rosetta Stone, however, demonstrated that the guess was defensible. [Silvestre de Sacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Isaac_Silvestre_de_Sacy), the first European to try a systematic study of the Rosetta Stone, was able to identify the names “Ptolemy” and “Alexander” in the Egyptian scripts by comparing their usage to the Greek. The Swedish scholar [Johan David Åkerblad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_David_%C3%85kerblad) expanded on this to get sound values for about half of the characters in the Demotic version of the stone: he was able to read proper names and a few other words in Demotic, though he failed to see that Demotic (like the Hieroglyphic text) was more complex than a simple alphabet.

_A letter of Thomas Young from 1818 (four years before Champollion unveiled his own translation) showing several signs Young had identified by comparison with the Greek and Demotic texts. Not all of these are correct, however: he mistakenly assumed a 1:1 correspondence of signs and Greek words like “Soter” and “Epiphanios.” He also still used the ancient (and incorrect) identification of the snake glyph_ ___𓆓___ _as “eternity” when in fact it’s just the sound “d” — or sometimes, it means “cobra Photo:_ _[British Museum](https://blog.britishmuseum.org/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-rosetta-stone/)_ 

By 1814 [Thomas Young](https://historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=2655) was more or less able to read the Demotic on the Rosetta stone and a few other bilingual inscriptions, proving that the language was Coptic-like. This also helped identify sound values for a few hieroglyphic characters which were visibly similar to their demotic counterparts.

During the years from 1802 (when the Stone finally ended up in the British Museum) and 1822 (when [Champollion ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/champollion_jean.shtml)announced his first systematic identifications) European travelers in Egypt began uncovering more bilingual texts. Today there more than 600 other known examples.

The availability of new texts helped identify other proper names, but the core of the writing system remained elusive.

__The fourth puzzle piece__ , the key insight that [Champollion ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/champollion_jean.shtml)added — the one that made the final translation possible — was that the Hieroglyphic text was _neither_ the all-symbolic “philosophical” language of Kircher _nor_  a pure alphabet. Instead it was a complex mix of alphabetic writing, logograms and extra symbols used to disambiguate.

Once that somewhat awkward leap was made, other pieces began to fall into place. Actually it was Young — who still believed the Hieroglyphic texts were mostly symbolic — who first noticed that an extra character in the name “Cleopatra” and guessed it was some kind of symbolic attribute:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cc2bda557f4e0e1518a113f92bd08f33)

_The last glyph in Cleopatra’s name is a_ _[determinative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinative#:~:text=In%20Ancient%20Egyptian%20hieroglyphs%2C%20determinatives,%22%20or%20%22excreted%20things%22.)_ _, a non-spoken character added to help clarify meaning: here it means “Goddess” (you can find it in Young’s letter, above)_ 

This insight started Champollion on a chain of inspired guesses which actually didn’t depend on the Rosetta Stone directly. He began to see that hieroglyphs were a mix of alphabetic and pictorial signs — and that sometimes the sounds of the pictorial signs were pressed into service as, essentially, abbreviations. Nowadays, we know that many hieroglyphs represent [two ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_biliteral_signs)or [three ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_triliteral_signs)consonants.

Champollion’s most famous leap was this — which was sent to him by another scholar and didn’t come from the Rosetta stone at all:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-135a94a03d84f7a846fea01455f71289)

He knew the last two characters were both “S” (see the Ptolemy cartouche above). He guessed that the first one might be the sun, which in Coptic is _re._ What’s a royal Egyptian name that states with Re? “Rameses!” So the central symbols must be an M. But, taking this back to the Rosetta stone, Champollion saw his “M” in the middle of a section where the Greek talked about birthdays. This made him realize that his “M,” too, was a word masquerading as a letter: in this case, the Coptic word _[mise](https://coptic-dictionary.org/entry.cgi?tla=C2035)_ _,_  “birth” So he now had two examples of signs doing double-duty as words and sounds.* This allowed him to start guessing sound values for unfamiliar signs by plugging in Coptic words as candidates — all the while knowing that the “words” could just be recycled for their sound values like “mise” becoming a syllable in “Rameses”. The Greek text provided a check on the meanings while the Demotic text transliterated by Young gave a good sense of what to look for.

There was, however, plenty of work to do: it should be obvious by now that this was a pretty tough writing system to decipher. Champollion himself said:

> Hieroglyphic writing is a complex system, a script all at once figurative, symbolic and phonetic, in one and the same text, in one and the same sentence, and, I might even venture, one and the same word.

The next 50 years or so would be hard going — the language of the texts was thousands of years removed from Coptic and the system itself quite complex, so progress was uneven. Nevertheless, as scholars got used to the different tactics employed by Egyptian scribes it became easier to see the inner logic of the system and by the end of the 19th century Egyptian could be read with pretty high confidence.

If you want to see how far we’ve come, Bill Manley’s book is an excellent introduction to Hieroglyphic writing in all its beauty and complexity and it doesn’t require a commitment to learning the Egyptian language or grammar.



——
* I’m simplifying a bit here: the writing system didn’t exactly repurpose the whole words, it repurposed their consonants. We don’t really know how to “say” a sign like 𓄤 which we can transliterate _nfr;_ any place an Egyptian scribe needed those three consonants he could drop in a 𓄤 regardless of how the pictured word — it means “good” or “perfect” but the pictogram is believed to be the guts of a sheep! — was actually pronounced. We say “nefer” [by convention](https://www.friesian.com/egypt.htm) but we don’t really know what the vowels were.
