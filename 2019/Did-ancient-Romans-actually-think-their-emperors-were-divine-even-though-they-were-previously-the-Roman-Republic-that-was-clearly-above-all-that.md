There’s a couple of dimensions to the emergence of emperor worship.

The first question is about __sincerity__ . The first and most important thing to remember is that the empire was born out of a military dictatorship__.__  Many Romans of the first generation or two — particularly Romans of the traditional political class — thought the whole thing was hooey. However the ones who were not careful about how they expressed their… skepticism… could end up in a _lot_  of trouble.

So, it’s not wise to read too much sincerity into those expressions of regard and “divine” adulation offered to the early emperors. Even most of them understood that. [The entire structure of the early empire was an elaborate effort to conceal the reality of absolute monarchy behind a facade of continuity with the republican past](https://www.quora.com/When-did-the-Roman-Empire-lose-its-veneer-of-Republicanism/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=404d08cc&srid=zLvM). In Italy, among the traditional leadership classes, a light touch was generally the order of the day. Even the crazy stories which we hear about Nero and Caligula in particular reflect the deep suspicion that the traditional upper classes retained about the new system, well into the second century.

A good index of the ambiguity here is the [Apocolocyntosis,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocolocyntosis) a satire penned by Nero’s tutor Seneca about the awkward reception which awaited emperor Claudius when he got to Mount Olympus after death. Granted, Seneca worked for Nero, and had every reason to make his predecessor look bad; nonetheless it’s also indicative of how little some people believed in imperial divinity in the late first century. Even more famous are the last words of emperor Vespasian: _Dear me, I think I’m becoming a god._

The second dimension of the question is “___which___ __Romans__ ?”

Outside of Italy, the story was quite different than it was for the remnants of the traditional Roman leadership class. In the Greek east, the habit of ruler-worship went back to Alexander and was completely uncontroversial, even if plenty of people regarded it more as political theater than serious theology. In the Latin west, “emperor worship” was not in fact Roman policy until the reign of Domitian (81–98); instead, the temples and sacrifices were [supposed to be offered to the emperor’s “genius”, his guardian spirit ](https://www.quora.com/What-did-the-word-genius-mean-to-the-ancient-Romans/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=9920a89d&srid=zLvM)or — in the case of deceased emperors — [to their posthumous status a](https://www.quora.com/When-the-Romans-deified-someone-what-was-the-theological-thinking-Did-they-think-they-could-make-someone-a-god/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=adfe1119&srid=zLvM)s[ companions of the gods.](https://www.quora.com/When-the-Romans-deified-someone-what-was-the-theological-thinking-Did-they-think-they-could-make-someone-a-god/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=adfe1119&srid=zLvM)

_A modern reconstruction of the temple of Claudius in Colchester, England — it was for a long time the largest building in the British Isles, and a central monument of “Roman-ness” for Britons. They can be forgiven for not getting all of the subtle theology behind it all._ 

These ambiguous forms of worship were designed in part to avoid outraging traditional sensibilities at home, but in the provinces the subtleties were largely ignored: without Rome’s domestic political baggage the provincials largely treated the emperors as Hellenistic-style, divine-while-alive figures. As Roman and Italian elites gradually lost their exclusive position at the pinnacle of Roman society those provincial habits submerged what was left of the old Republican sensibility. By the end of the third century, under Diocletian, the Romans had adopted elaborate forms of veneration which would have been familiar to Xerxes and Darius — prostrating oneself on the floor, kissing the hem of the emperor’s robes, covering the head when addressing him and so on.

Interestingly some of those forms long outlived any theoretical belief in the emperor’s divinity. Elements of the divinized court ceremonial survived well into the Byzantine era, centuries after Christianity was the central ideological pillar of the empire. Here’s a (somewhat biased) depiction of court life in the reign of Justinian (527–565)

> with Justinian and Theodora, everyone, including those of patrician rank, had to make their entrance by falling straight on the ground, flat on their faces; then, stretching their arms and legs out as far as they would go, they had to touch, with their lips, one foot of each of the two. Only then could they stand up again.

in fact the classic posture of adoration that you see in a lot of medieval art is an re-adaptation of the secularized court ritual back to divine purposes:
