There are no accounts of his life other than those in his own work.

If youâ€™re wondering about his historicity, he was being fairly widely quoted by around the end of the second century (a century or so after his death). This was mostly in Christian sources, but the pagan philosopher Porphyry also quotes him. Second-century references can be found in Origen, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, and Irenaeus.
