The earliest bits and pieces of written Latin date back to the 7th century BC. The oldest long-form text is the [Lapis Niger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_Niger), an enigmatic religious inscription found in the Roman Forum, pre-dates the Roman Republic (it seems to refer to a king, so it must be older than 509 BC) .

_The Lapis Niger_ 

The oldest known piece of Latin literature - as distinct from _writing_ - is probably the work of [Livius Andronicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livius_Andronicus) from the 3rd century BC. It is clear from the work of his younger contemporary [Ennius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennius) that the Romans already had a well-developed tradition of official chronicles by this time: Ennius’s work the [Annales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annales_(Ennius)) draws on the Roman tradition of [Annalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annalists) or official chroniclers.

It’s clear that the Romans and Etruscans got their letters originally through the Greek settlements in southern Italy, which started popping up in the 8th century BC, so that is the earliest possible date.
