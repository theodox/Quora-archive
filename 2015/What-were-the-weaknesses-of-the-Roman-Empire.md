The big one, the crippling one, was the inability of imperial Rome to keep its military out of politics. 

By the first century BC, the Roman army had become almost entirely professional -- where the armies that fought Hannibal had been mostly middle class draftees, the armies of Marius and Sulla consisted of long-service soldiers, usually recruited from the lower classes, who lived and fought far from home for years at a time. These professional troops were cut off from the political and social loyalties of civilians -- and their retirement prospects depended very heavily on the political fortunes of the generals who led them. Marius, Sulla, Pompey and Caesar all defined their political careers by lobbying for land grants and other benefits for their veterans. 

This ended up breaking the tie between the armies and the state, replacing in with a much narrower bond between the armies and their leaders -- particularly when those leaders were charismatic and successful commanders whose conquests provided loot and the promise of comfortable retirement. Between 88 BC and 27 AD, Sulla, Marius, Julius Caesar, Sertorius, Sextus Pompey, Marc Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian Caesar all used their armies against the legal government of Rome -- and while Pompey, Brutus, Cassius and Cato were at least theoretically fighting for the government the all treated their armies more or less as private possessions too.

Augustus finally eliminated the last of his rivals in 27 -- the date traditionally used for the final transition from the Republic to the Empire. Although he and his successors tried to preserve the illusion of continuity with the old Republic, he was careful to retain personal control over the military and the finances that made it run. He deliberately fostered the idea that the emperor and the army had a special bond - the ideal of civilian control of the military (once so sacred in the Republic that even a triumphing army could not bring its arms into the city) -- was dead. "Emperor" comes from _Imperator --_ a title not bestowed by the government, but by the acclamation of the troops.

Since the Romans never evolved either a written constitution or a strong dynastic system (see [Why was the Roman succession so violent? ](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires)) the army remained the arbiter of real power. In the first century or so the [Praetorian Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetorian_Guard) were the main arbiters of succession, since they were the main military force close to Rome itself. However already by the [Year of the Four Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Four_Emperors) (69 AD) the various frontier armies had begun to put forth rival candidates -- a pattern which would eventually come to dominate Roman politics

The string of strong emperors with more or less planned successions from Nerva (96) to Marcus Aurelius (185)-- the so called "[Five Good Emperors](http://www.britannica.com/topic/Five-Good-Emperors)" -- marked the _only_  century between Julius Caesar and the fall of Constantinople in 1453 without a significant military insurrection.. In the terrible years of the third century more than 50 would-be emperors claimed the purple and the empire split into 3 mutually hostile parts. Even strongmen like Diocletian and Constantine were unable to create lasting institutions which could keep ambitious generals from seizing power. 

This didn't make for good governance -- but it did make for intrigue and betrayal. Even in the desperate days of the 5th century, with barbarian kings appropriate huge chunks of Roman territory, many emperors worried more about their own armies more than those of the enemy. The ablest generals of the failing empire -- [Stilicho](http://Stilicho) and [Aetius](http://Aetius) -- were both killed by their on lords on suspicion. The last western emperor worth a damn, [Majorian](http://Majorian) , was himself a military usurper -- and he was overthrown by another warlord. The empire fell the same way it rose.
