_Venus regnat_ would work, or if you want to emphasize the “domination” of love you could use _Venus imperat_ , “Venus gives orders”.

You could also go with the famous old Latin tag _Amor vincit omnia,_ “Love conquers all” — the Romans loved talking about personified abstractions so _Amor_ , “love” could also be “Love” — aka Venus, aka Aphrodite.
