It’s literally just “standing up” or “standing up _again”_ . _Ana-_  is a prefix meaning “up” or “upwards” but also “again” or “back.” _Stasis_  is the noun form of _[histemi](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%B5%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B9)_ _,_ which is a verb meaning to stand up or to set up.

Most of the time you encounter _anastasis_ it’s in a religious context, where it means “resurrection” — the derivation from ‘standing up’ is obvious, and the Latin means almost the same thing (_resurgo_ in Latin is likewise “I get back up again,” and _resurrectio_  is probably a literal translation of _anastasis_ ). Its the root of Christian names like Anastasia or Anastasios. However the literal meaning is found; Herodotus describes the evacuation of Ionian Greeks from the threat of a Persian army as _anastasis;_ the same word would describe, say, the setting up of a victory monument on the site of a battle.
