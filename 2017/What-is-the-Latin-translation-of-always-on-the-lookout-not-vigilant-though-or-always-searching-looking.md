Actually the first thing that comes to mind really is _semper vigilans, vigilo_ means something like “I am watchful” or “I am wide awake and alert” (the word originally means ‘to stay up all night’ — the _vigiles_  were the night watch, up all night watching for fires). Not surprisingly this is a common motto for things like police departments.

_semper adquirens_ would be more like “always looking around”, with the implications you’re looking for a specific thing (not just generally watchful). “Always seeking” might be more the spirit.

_semper vestigans_ , is more or less “always seeking out” or “always discovering” in the sense of uncovering or revealing things.
