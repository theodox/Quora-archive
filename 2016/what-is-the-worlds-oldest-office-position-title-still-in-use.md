By tradition the four oldest patriarchal sees of the Christian church all date back to the first century, though there are rival lines of descent from the third century on. The bishops of Rome, Jerusalem and Alexandria have traditional connections with the apostles, but only the [Patriarchs of Antioch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch_of_Antioch) can trace named individual bishops back that far.
