As an indie dev it’s extremely hard to find an audience for your project. The sad truth is that good games come and go without getting much attention every day. There’s a reason why one of the most popular resources on indie marketing is titled [The Single Most Important Thing That No One Knows How to Do](http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/marketing-your-indie-game-the-single-most-important-thing-that-no-one-knows-how-to-do--gamedev-7157).

There are a couple of things you can and should do to increase your visibility:

__Know your audience.__  Games nowadays are highly subdivided by genre and by audience. Trying to sell Candy Crush to Call of Duty fans - or vice versa - is not a path to success. Think hard about who you think will like your game and find out where they hang out: which communities and social spaces are favorites with the kind of people you expect to be making the game for. Spend time there, learning more about what they think and want. Look for ways in which they feel like current games don’t serve them.

__Get help.__ Developers tend to be a bit macho about their side of the business: we are overly impressed by technical daring and game design chops and often too dismissive about the grubby business of… business. Selling things -- even cool things — is _hard_ . In some ways it’s harder and less predictable than making stuff. So don’t assume that it’s _beneath_  you to sell your game. Find people who actually sell stuff for a living and get them to help you out. You probably can’t hire top talent but you can find people who are starting their career in marketing the way you’re starting your career in games. Get them to help out as friends or as partners. Learn from them and take them seriously. Just knowing your way around C# is not enough.

__Start early.__ Real world marketing for commercial projects is planned long before the actual products hit the shelves. Don’t wait until the game is almost done to engage with fans: make it a point to get your message out early and to get people involved in the project — a dev blog, teaser videos, fan forums and active communications all help a lot in finding an audience that will be ready to buy your game when it’s ready. More importantly you also want those folks to be spreading the word and building anticipation before you’re done. You don’t have the money for big-time ad campaigns so you need a community to really push you over the top.

B__efriend Artists and sound designers.__ Good quality art and sound (lots of people badly under-appreciate the role of sound!) make a big difference. Purists will object that these things don’t feed into ‘gameplay’ — they don’t affect the brilliance of your cool design concept or awesome tech. But the fact is nobody will see those things if they look at your screenshots and what they see is something ugly or garish. There are lots of talented artists, animators and sound designers in the same spot as you: you should try to find and partner with them. Solo success is extremely hard: game development is a team sport. You need to find a team.

__Learn from others.__  The indie scene produces a lot of articulate, thoughtful people like [Dan Cook](http://www.lostgarden.com/), [Jon Blow](http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/01/07/ready-player-none/), or [Robin Hunicke](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/dec/06/journey-preview-robin-hunicke-interview) just to pull some names out of the air. Find some successful indie devs and follow their blogs and twitter feeds. Maybe — tentatively, respectfully — reach out to a couple for advice or feedback. But pay attention to the experiences they share.
