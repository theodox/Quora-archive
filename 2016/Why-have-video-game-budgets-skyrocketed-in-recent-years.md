There’s actually been two countervailing trends, but they aren’t that new: both go back at least a decade and more like 15 years.

The budgets of the biggest budget games have definitely gone up — big mega-blockbuster productions like GTA V and Destiny can see budgets of hundreds of millions of dollars (the real budgets are often a closely guarded secret: exactly what’s part of the budget has profound implications for the studios, the publishers and the tax man — the numbers quoted in the press are usually guesstimates or ballpark numbers cited for different purposes).

On the other hand the _average_ game budget has plummeted in the last decade — because the _average_  game is now a smallish indie title produced by a dozen or fewer people. These usually have shoestring budgets, at least by the standards of Assassin’s Creed. We know about the ones that do well and make a lot of money — but statistically those are a blip: most indie games don’t cover their costs, even though those are low.

The real losers in the last decade have been mid-sized studios and projects: the 50–75 person studio working on a $25 million budget is a real rarity now; many of those studios have been absorbed into the monoliths or have fragmented into the ecosystem of mobile, casual and F2p. Here in Seattle we used to have a dozen or more midsized outfits; now most of them have either gone huge, gone indie, or gone extinct.

The two things that drive this evolution are content cost and marketing money.

Modern graphics are super demanding and labor intensive. Here’s a character I did for [Half-Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)) in 1997:

Here’s a similar character from a decade later (and almost a decade ago!)

The first one took about __two__ working weeks; the second one took __seven__ . Modelling isn’t much worse today (the workflow for making super-high res original models and turning them into game assets has matured) but texturing, shading and animation are all much more sophisticated than they were back then: you’ve got to worry about everything from physics interactions to subsurface light scattering to the umpteen transitions between animations that keep things smooth and responsive. I’d bet that the total labor involved in creating and animating a similar character today is at least 100 days if you count all the people involved.

That’s what’s happened.

In AAA game of the year 2000 a single artist could create a character from scratch: modeling, animation and texturing were all sufficiently simple that a decent artist could be good at all of them. Nowadays a AAA character can easily involve a dozen or more people, not just concept people, modelers and texture artists but character riggers, character and technical animators, shader artists, mocap actors and more.

Why do we let this go on?

Well, a lot of people don’t . A lot of the initial impetus for what we now call “indie games” came from disillusioned developers who were tired of being #211 out of 373 on a huge production floor and wanted to have some ownership over their games, even if that mean <rolls eyes> _pixel platformers_  </rolls eyes>.

But, for the big studios — the one that managed to survive the gigantic content bloat that started in the 360/PS3 generation — it’s a critical way to get back something most game studios have lost: the all important _barrier to entry._  Hollywood has had to do the same thing:__in a world where everybody with an HD camera and some acting school friends can tell a moving story or comment on society, telling moving stories and commenting on society is a low-margin business__ . Not everybody can raise $400 million in development money and another $300M in marketing; not everybody can actually manage to coordinate the efforts of a 700 person team on three continents. That means__if you’re lucky enough (and rich enough) to be in that kind of business you have many, many fewer competitors and a correspondingly rosier economic future.__ 

The problem, of course, is that its very hard to take creative risks when you’re borrowing a quarter of a billion dollars to fund your project (and remember: if the developer spends $250 million, they[ have to earn back more like $350 million ](https://www.quora.com/If-I-create-a-moderately-successful-AAA-game-will-I-become-a-millionaire)before they see any profit at all!). Thus, the well known and easy-to-complain-about sequelitis, lack of innovation and overall me-too-ism in the AAA space.

Life was pretty cushy back when making games was technologically hard. Now that any kid with gumption can download Unreal or Unity and start with an engine that, frankly, beats the pants off the best engines of the early 2000’s — now that there are dozens of schools cranking out artists and animators — developers are in the same kind of squeeze that music and movie producers face: there’s always somebody smart and hungry and willing to work for peanuts. Either you have to go ultra-lean and be really, really efficient or you have to go large and simply out-spend most possible rivals. If you’re just there in the middle, [things are pretty rough.](http://kotaku.com/5876693/every-game-studio-thats-closed-down-since-2006)
