It was probably _Sparatokos_ , which is a common Thracian name. See [http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Thrace_and_Dacia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Thrace_and_Dacia) for several kings of the Odrysae with variants of the name. 

Of course, slaveowners often redubbed slaves with foreign names, much as was done here in the states. An educated Roman might have named him Spartacus as a mocking compliment, like calling a Frenchman Napoleon.
