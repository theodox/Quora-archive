The Roman state didn't have the modern option of debt financing: there was no Roman equivalent to bonds, so there was no way for the state to raise money by selling future obligations and thus no way to enter into fiscal debt the way modern states do. In Republican times some provincial governors forced their subjects to loan money to the Roman government (or to themselves). These loans were always of dubious legality and hard to distinguish from plain old extortion. 

Rome could and did occasionally run out of ready money; Vespasian, famously, had to rebuild the finances of the empire (squandered by the erratic Nero and in the [Year of the Four Emperors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Four_Emperors)) by creating a raft of new taxes on everything up to an including public urinals --- French public bathrooms are still sometimes called _vespasiennes._ Taxes were raised on a huge range of activities from the obvious (trade duties, landed property, wills) to the peculiar (visits to prostitutes. sedan-chair porters, filing lawsuits). 

The taxes tended to come and go -- apart from land taxes and customs duties, which were more or less the backbone of finance, the system tended to lurch from one expedient to another in a somewhat gimmicky fashion. Unlike modern governments, of course, the Roman government was not constrained by the need to get popular agreement to new taxes. Emperors could adjust taxation as they saw fit, although pushing the populace too hard could lead to riots (Caligula, for example, was much disliked for his persistent efforts to raise money and some of his taxes led to bloodshed). 

Emperors could also improve their financial situations by outright confiscation: it was widely believed -- albeit by hostile sources -- that emperors Nero and Domitian augmented their finances with the wealth of the nobles whom they condemned on charges of treason or _lese majeste;_ since plots, real or imagined, were a province of wealthy aristocrats the amount of money involved could be quite significant. 

In many provinces the bulk of taxes were collected in kind: Egypt and Africa, for example, paid their tribute to the central government in grain rather than in cash (at the local level the taxes were collected as a mix of cash and commodity collections). Many ordinary people (outside of Italy) were liable for some kind of forced labor contributions -- maintaining roads or aqueducts, for example. Naturally, these kinds of taxation were not easily manipulated like modern balance sheets; I assume (no sources for this) that some of these things were commutable in cash, and it's easy to imagine local governments 'loaning' corvee labor or commodities to well connected parties in return for cash, probably with varying degrees of corruption. 

 The temple of Saturn stored a permanent 'rainy day fund' in Republican and early imperial times -- one of the reasons for Caesar's triumph was his seizure of these funds, which Pompey failed to evacuate when leaving the city. In real emergencies, all the temples formed a sort of reserve fund: their valuable furnishings and statuary were occasionally seized and melted down for ready money. 

One last trick that the Romans used repeatedly to manage their finances was to debase the currency: adulterating gold and silver coins with cheaper metal. This was effectively 'printing money'. It was universally condemned in antiquity, but it was done quite frequently. Restoring the purity of the coinage was regarded as one of the signs of an enlightened ruler. 

During the military crisis of the third century, central control was shaky and the various usurpers who contended for the purple did whatever they had to do to keep their armies in the field. After Diocletian the situation stabilised in a new form, with a much more comprehensive, empire-wide bureaucracy, aggressive regulation of local trade, and far more one-size-fits-all standardization. This helped to maintain the armies and keep the empire together, but over the long haul it severely weakened the economy, encouraging de-urbanisation and pushing a lot of commerce out of cash and into harder-to-control local production.
