The easy way would be _auxilium agile innovans._ (the e is long, so it’s ‘ageelay’ not ‘agile’) .

However my instinct would be to get a little farther from the literal translation. All three of your key words are actually already Latin at one remove (“support” is also Latin _supporto,_  but Latin only has it as a verb so I swapped in _auxilium_ ). However, all three have subtly different meanings in Latin. Plus — from a motto standpoint — it nice to have a little bit of distance from ordinary English — otherwise it sounds a bit like school humor.

With that in mind _adjumentum citatum sollers_ sounds less English-y and has a bunch of impressive sounding Latinate syllables. _[Adjumentum](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=adjumentum&la=la#lexicon)_ , like _auxilium_ , means assistance and support — but it won’t sound to English ears like _auxiliary_ , which we tend to think of as ‘secondary’. _[Sollers](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=sollers&la=la#lexicon)_ __ means ‘clever, skilled, or dextrous’ so it combines both ‘agile’ and ‘innovative’ without the English sound. Plus, in Latin ‘innovative’ was usually a negative — _innovans_  does mean ‘innovating’, ie, ‘making new stuff up’ — but in the ancient world that wasn’t necessarily seen as a _good_  idea. [Citatum](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=c%C4%ADt%C4%81tus&la=la&can=c%C4%ADt%C4%81tus0#lexicon) is “swift, speedy, at full speed,” it focuses on the rapidity side of “agile” and not the nimbleness side, however.

Incidentally the word order doesn’t strictly matter here, you could rearrange it to fit a logo as you saw fit without changing the meanings.
