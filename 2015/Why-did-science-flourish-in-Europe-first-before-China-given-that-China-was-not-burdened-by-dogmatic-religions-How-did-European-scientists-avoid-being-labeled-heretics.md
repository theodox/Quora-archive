# Why did science flourish in Europe first before China, given that China was not burdened by dogmatic religions? How did European scientists avoid being labeled heretics?

To reinforce what [Jason St. Pierre](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jason-St-Pierre-3) lays out, this question is riddled with false assumptions.

Just to pile on, here's a short list (which could be expanded greatly) of medieval scientists who were also churchmen:



[Bede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede), mathematician and astronomer

[Pope Sylvester II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sylvester_II), mathematician and logician who introduced arabic numerals to Europe

[Bishop Robert Grosseteste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Grosseteste), who studied optics and mathematics and advocated the use of experiments rather than raw theorizing

[Roger Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon), widely credited as the first advocate of the scientific method. Also the first European to describe gunpowder -- which was brought back to Europe from China by missionaries who had made the trip. He did get in some kind of trouble with the church authorities -- mostly because he advocated for a more literal reading of the Bible. 

[Albertus Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertus_Magnus), who was among other things a mineralogist, geographer, botanist and biologist; his most famous quote is _"The aim of natural philosophy (science) is not to simply to accept the statements of others, but to investigate the causes that are at work in nature."_  

[Jean Buridan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Buridan), a physicist who formulated the modern concept of inertia


and of course



[Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus), the prime exponent of heliocentrism... who dedicated his book to the Pope. 


As for the role of religion in China -- the phrasing of the question is so far off as to make it impossible to answer effectively. However it's pretty clear that - particularly from the 16th century onward - the primary impediment to Chinese science wasn't Chinese or imported religious belief: it was the dismissive attitudes of the Chinese elite who denigrated studies outside the recognized canons of the Chinese literary tradition. Dogmatism comes in lots of guises.

In that connection, you'd have to dig pretty deep to find a church that worked as hard at suppressing uncomfortable scientific discoveries as the staunchly atheistic Soviet Union, which actively suppressed [genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism) and [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Kondratiev), and only embraced the "bourgeois idealism" of relativity when it became necessary to build bombs. And if you really want to see the mass persecution of scientists, the best example of all is Mao's Cultural Revolution, where merely possessing an education rendered your liable to 're-education' or worse.
