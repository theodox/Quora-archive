I've seen _[Nešas](https://books.google.com/books?id=tzU3RIV2BWIC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=hittite+ethonym&source=bl&ots=wWo__15b7E&sig=jg53qRp0eu66VJG7NBuzNscWtao&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXwOzhkJzKAhVCKGMKHQSPAKsQ6AEIOzAH#v=onepage&q=hittite%20ethonym&f=false)_  and [Nesšumna](http://gizidda.altervista.org/ebooks/hittitegrammar.pdf) proposed. The vowels are kind of conjectural anyway since this was all written in Akkadian cuneiform.

The country is _Hatti,_ after the pre-Hittite inhabitants of the same name. At least in politics they used that a lot and the ethonym less often: so in the ["Eternal Treaty"](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/ramses-hattusili-treaty.htm) they always say "the land of Hatti" and never "the Hittites".
