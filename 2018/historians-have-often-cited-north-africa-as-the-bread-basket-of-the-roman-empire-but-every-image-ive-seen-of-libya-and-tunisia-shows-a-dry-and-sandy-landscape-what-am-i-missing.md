# Historians have often cited North Africa as the 'bread basket' of the Roman Empire, but every image I've seen of Libya and Tunisia shows a dry and sandy landscape. What am I missing?

North Africa, of course, covers a lot of territory — it’s got a wide range of microclimates.

_In Roman times the grain trade was generally centered east of the Atlas mountains; Moroccan agriculture was not as well developed as today._ 

The core of “Africa” in the Roman economy was centered on Carthage, where intensive agricultural improvements in the well-watered coastal regions made for a very productive environment. The shape of the grain-growing regions was ideal — even if the interior of the country was more fertile, the huge cost of overland transport would not have made it profitable. Most people in the region, in any case, lived within 150 miles of the sea.

In the grain-growing regions, there was significant investment in water supply and in technologies like terracing to improve the productivity of the land. There was also intensive cultivation of olives, which work well in the local climate

As a whole it’s drier now than it was in the Roman period for a number of reasons — climate change, the exhaustion of fossil water supplies, and the loss of greenbelt vegetation due to overgrazing. However a lot of the coastal regions remain very agriculturally productive. There’s more detail in [Why was North Africa considered the breadbasket of the Roman Empire, considering how infertile it is?
