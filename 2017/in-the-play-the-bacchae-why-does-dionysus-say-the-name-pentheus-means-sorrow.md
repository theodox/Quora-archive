Πενθεύς, _Pentheus_ is the king of Thebes; but the word is just his proper name. His title would be _basileus,_ “king.”

πένθος _penthos_ does literally mean sorrow, misfortune, or mourning. You’ll notice that the accents are different — I’m not certain if there’s some other historical derivation for the proper name. Nevertheless it doesn’t take much to turn _Pentheus_ into _penthos_ , and the Greeks tended to love that kind of wordplay.
