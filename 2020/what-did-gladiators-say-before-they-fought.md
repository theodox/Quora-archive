The traditional phrase is supposedly _[Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ave_Imperator,_morituri_te_salutant)_ _: “hail, emperor, those who are about to die salute you” —_ though it’s not clear if that was some kind of regular observance, since the quote comes from an extravagant faux naval battle staged for emperor Claudius on the Fucine Lake, not a regular amphitheater show.

However there’s also the rather more… vivid… gladiator’s oath alluded to in the _[Satyricon](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0027%3Atext%3DSatyricon%3Asection%3D117)_ _:_ 

> Itaque ut duraret inter omnes tutum mendacium, in verba Eumolpi sacramentum iuravimus: uri, vinciri, verberari ferroque necari, et quicquid aliud Eumolpus iussisset. Tanquam legitimi gladiatores domino corpora animasque religiosissime addicimus.

> we took an oath to obey Eumolpus; to endure burning, bondage, flogging, death by the sword, or anything else that Eumolpus ordered. We pledged our bodies and souls to our master most solemnly, like regular gladiators.

This comes from a satire, so it’s not necessarily a verbatim recreation of something official — though it does appear from context to be at least paraphrase of something the audience was expected to recognize.
