Mythologically the most common answer would be __yes__ (though, mythologically, there is _always_  some variant version which differs from the one you got from Bulfinch or D’Aulaire or Percy Jackson). Many people know that Aphrodite was born from sea-foam, the mythical justification for the famous Botticelli painting:

The standard version is that the sea-foam was the residue that arose when Zeus’s father, [Kronos](https://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanKronos.html) castrated his own father [Ouranos](https://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Ouranos.html), and tossed his severed member into the sea. So, naturally — a word which sounds admittedly a bit _strange_  in this context — Aphrodite pre-dates Zeus and his Olympian brethren.

There is, however there is a less spicy version of her origin in which Aphrodite is the child of Zeus and [Dione](https://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanisDione.html) — in that case, of course, she comes after the first Olympians.



On a more down-to-earth plane, Aphrodite as a historical actor is __much older__ than the Olympians.

One of her Aphrodite’s most common pseudonyms is _Kypris —_ etymologically related to the word for “copper” and the island of Cyprus. In the Greek and Roman era, Cyprus was one of the main center’s of Aphrodite’s cult . Bronze age Cyprus was a major commercial hub, because it was a source of the copper on which Bronze Age states relied. It was also a cultural crossroads, with connections to Egypt, Asia Minor, the Levant, and Phoenicia as well as Greece.

Aphrodite was, essentially, one of the many important commodities which passed through Bronze Age Cyprus — she seems to have been a syncretized version of [Astarte](https://www.worldhistory.org/astarte/), a Canaanite goddess whose remit include love and fertility but also war. Astarte herself was an import from farther east; she’s the Canaanite face of the Mesopotamian goddess [Ishtar](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Ishtar).

Ishtar, in turn, is generally seen as an evolution of the Sumerian goddess [Inanna](https://www.worldhistory.org/Inanna/). Innana is attested all the way back to Sumerian times — in fact., she’s one of the oldest recorded deities, at least, one the oldest whose names and symbolism we know with certainty. Here’s an image of Inanna from the Sumerian city of Uruk — more than fifteen hundred years before the oldest mention of any Olympian god by name:

So, in this sense it’s fair to say that Aphrodite->Astarte->Ishtar->Inanna is way older than the Olympians.

Incidentally the legend of Aphrodite’s birth from Kronos’ severed appendage has a physical manifestation that connects the Greek and Cypriot/Near Eastern strands of Aphrodite’s heritage. There’s a sea-stack off the shore of Cyprus, near [Paphos](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/79/), which hosted one of the prime centers of Aphrodite’s cult in Greek times. Its base produces a lot of sea-foam as the tides and come and go. And its shape is… suggestive (and may have been moreso in antiquity)

__PS__ Thanks to [Spencer McDaniel](https://www.quora.com/profile/Spencer-McDaniel-11) and [Zartusht Ashavan](https://www.quora.com/profile/Zartusht-Ashavan) who both caught my — stupid done-from-memory first version of this, wherein I swapped the castration of Kronos by Zeus for the castration of Ouranos by Kronos, a generation earlier. It’s a sad sign of the times when one can’t keep one’s castrations straight.
