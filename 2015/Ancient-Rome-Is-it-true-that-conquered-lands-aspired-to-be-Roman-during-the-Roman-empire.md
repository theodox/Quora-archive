After a fashion.

If you mean,___did some places/peoples want to be annexed by the Romans?___  the answer is "sometimes, but not usually". The dividing line between 'ally', 'client state' and 'subject' was pretty fuzzy: During the Republic, the Romans preferred to deal with stable, friendly and not-quite-able-to-stand-on-their-own client states; as long as King X or tribe Y was a reliable ally and willing to take foreign policy cues from Rome, the Romans found it cheaper and easier to leave these states independent. The big step was the switch from being an 'ally' --at least nominally independent -- and becoming a province, ruled directly by Rome. This was not usually something that either the locals or the Romans preferred. Provincialization was only used in places where the Romans could not find stable, reliable collaborators: usually if the area was politically unstable or bitterly anti-Roman (for example, in Carthage or Macedonia after 146 BC).

However, A handful of Rome's closest allies voluntarily submitted themselves to Roman overlordship in a more direct way Most of Italy became 'Roman' via gradual assimilation; Rome's Italian allies actually fought a war --- the [Social War](http://Social War) of 90 BC -- demanding full Roman citizenship, since they had been so closely integrated into Roman life for so long that pretending they were 'independent' was a political disadvantage.

 Sometimes Roman allies found it easier to become Roman than to face faction fights or local rivals: the kingdom of [Pergamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pergamon) in Asia Minor which was left to Rome in the will of the last king, Attalus III to avoid a civil war. Quite often a weak local ruler would submit to Rome in order to bolster their domestic position: Cleopatra, for example, submitted to Caesar in order to get help in a civil war against her brother. 

Of course these kind of power-political maneuvers were the business of kings and queens, not ordinary people: 

On the other hand, if you're asking ___did the inhabitants of the empire aspire to be more 'Roman' in culture?___ _,_ the answer is a qualified yes. During the first and second centuries AD the empire had a period of unprecedented economic and cultural integration: the _Pax Romana_  and the disappearance of many barriers today produced an economic boom and a huge upswing in the movement of peoples and good across the Empire: something like today's globalization. 

In this period Roman -- or more precisely, Greco-Roman -- cultural prestige was very high and lots of non-Romans adopted the cultural stylings of Rome . This was both a tribute to Roman success and also good business: in the new international order an ambitious person from Scotland, Syria, or Samothrace could cut a grand figure on an imperial scale -- the first non-Roman Roman emperor was the Spaniard [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan) in 98, and in the next century there were emperors from Libya, Gaul, North Africa, Syria and the Balkans. If you wanted to be rich and powerful it made sense to dress, talk and act like a Roman: not only was that the language of power, it was also the only thing that the hundreds of different cultures in the empire had in common. 

Moreover easy trade made the movement of ideas and techniques much more fluid than it had ever been before (or would be again until quite recently). To give you an idea of how widely Roman cultural tropes were copied, this mosaic is from Syria..

There were still plenty of people who wanted to hang on to their local cultures, religions and traditions. Often the Roman layer was something that non-Romans could don and doff at will, just as many non-Westerners do today when swapping between an westernized internet persona online and a different one at home. In some cases, local resistance to Roman culture became violent -- the Romans violently suppressed the Jews, the Gaulish druids, and anybody else who challenged the ultimate supremacy of Rome. 

 In the 4th and 5th centuries, when economic bad times and increasingly intrusive government made the central authorities less popular, local identities re-asserted themselves. Many of the 'religious' controversies that rocked the later Empire were also ethnic or cultural conflicts in theological disguise.
