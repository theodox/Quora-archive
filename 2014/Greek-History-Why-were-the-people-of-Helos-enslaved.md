[Achilleas Vortselas](https://www.quora.com/profile/Achilleas-Vortselas) answer covers the bases pretty well. Sparta was a conquest state. What's unusual about it is how long the Spartans remained actively separate from and exploitative of the Helots: few systems of caste domination elsewhere lasted so long with so little erosion.

For context, there was a wide-spread Greek belief (sometimes disputed by modern historians) that the Dorians conquered the native populations of most of Greece and subjugated them. 

Sparta is an extreme example, since (if the conquest story is true, at any rate) they preserved a strict distinction between the conquerors and conquered for much longer than their neighbors. However several other cities in the area had similar caste-like systems early in their history: for example, at Sicyon where the Dorian nobility was eventually overthrown by Cleisthenes: [Cleisthenes Of Sicyon (tyrant of Sicyon)](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/120929/Cleisthenes-Of-Sicyon). Another group of Dorians set up a very Spartan-like two-tier system in Crete. Sparta is unusual because the rigid segregation lasted so late into historic times.

Around the end of the 19th century it was fashionable to make an analogy between the "Dorian conquest" of Greece and the "Aryan conquest" of India, and to point out that the rule of the Spartans resembled a militarized version of the ancient Indian caste system. That description has fallen out of favor and newer explanations tend to emphasize collaboration and cross-cultural mixing more than conquest and subjugation. However, there is no doubt that the historical Spartans practiced a particularly nasty form of oppressive rule over the Helots, and with other examples of related people doing the same it seems like the simplest explanation for the Greek case.
