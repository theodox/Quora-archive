The earliest treaties are more interesting - they illustrate the degree to which Carthage in particular was trying to monopolize long distance trade in the western Mediterranean, while Rome was trying to achieve preeminence in the Italian peninsula. Before the first Punic War the informal subtext of all of this was "you take the sea, we take the land". Predictably it was conflict over Sicily which destroyed that arrangement: once both sides had important interests and friends in Sicily it was no longer possible to divide up the spoils in the same way.

You can definitely see how the balance of power tilts away from Rome and towards Carthage in each successive treaty. 

The treaty after the second Punic war is interesting mostly because it showcases the different view of the war on both sides. By the time of the third war it becomes evident that Rome believed Carthage was 'conquered' in the second war, bound to be a dutiful ally; Carthage. on the other hand, felt that it had paid off the indemnity in the treaty (they paid it off early) and was now free to do as it wished. That difference leads pretty directly to the third Punic war and the annihilation of Carthage ([Why did Rome destroy Carthage?](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Rome-destroy-Carthage))
