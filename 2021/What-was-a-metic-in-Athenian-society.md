What we’d call a “resident alien” — a foreigner legally resident in Athens. The Greek work is μέτοικος, _métoikos_ and it translates literally as “cohabitator” or “one living with.”

Athens had extremely restrictive citizenship laws: you could not be an Athenian citizen unless you could prove all four of your grandparents were themselves citizens. If you had a lot of money you might be able to convince the city to grant you citizenship if you did enough civic good (say, outfitting a few warships for the navy out of your own pocket). But for the most part it was “once a foreigner, always a foreigner”. About a quarter of the city’s free population were metics.

Metics had legal protection for their property and limited access to the court system, but they could not vote or hold elective office. They were however required to serve in the military and pay taxes — at least, they did if they were wealthy, since both of those obligations had property qualifications. A large proportion of the metics were merchants or skilled craftsmen who immigrated to Athens for economic reasons. Most of the rest were freed slaves or the children of freed slaves.

After the classical period (say, after about 300 BC) the restrictions became a lot looser and citizenship became more accessible.
