You can get familiar with the basic concepts in a few months: the UI is fairly standard and the basic ideas aren't too hard (my son, who's 16, picked it up over the course of a summer without much hand-holding from me).

Getting to be productive takes longer: it will be hard to be competitive with less than a couple of years of experience. Learning what buttons to push is easy; turning button-pushes into actual _art_  is much harder. If you already have good traditional art skills it will be a little faster : one of the dangers of 3D art is that one becomes so proud of mastering the features of the software that one loses critical perspective on whether the actual work looks good.
