It was not firmly dated until very recently.

His original epitaph was only rediscovered in 1991, and even it is not complete. We’ve long had a manuscript copy but it provides the ambiguous date _“XII Kal Sept Zenone Imperatore”_ , which would be “12 days before the Kalends of September (ie, August 21st) under emperor Zeno” . But that could be any year in Zeno’s reign.

[However, a new manuscript with slightly longer copy of the epitaph surfaced in 2014](https://sidonapol.org/epitaph/). This ends with “Duodecimo Kalendas Septembris Zenone _consule_ .”, ie, “21 August in the consulship of Zeno.” Zeno’s last consulate was in 479, so that has to be the year of Sidonius’ death. Zeno’s previous consulate was in 475, but that was the year Sidonius was released from captivity by [Euric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euric), and we know that he lived and wrote for some years after that time.

__Note: If you’re seeing these images blurred out as “sensitive”… well, don’t blame me or Sidonius Appolinaris.__ I assume this is bot-fail.
