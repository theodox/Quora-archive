I think that the Jews, Druids, Manichees, Christians and even the worshipers of Bacchus would beg to differ that tolerance defines Roman paganism.

The Romans deliberately exterminated the Druidic religion in Gaul and Britain; or at least, they exterminated the Druids themselves — which for an unwritten religion amounted to much the same thing. One of the few achievements which Roman historians were willing to accord to emperor Claudius was _Druidarum religionem apud Gallos dirae immanitatis et tantum ciuibus sub Augusto interdictam penitus aboleuit;_ “He utterly abolished the inhuman religion of the Druids among the Gauls, which under Augustus had merely been prohibited to Roman citizens” (Suetonius, _Claudius_  25). The Romans made a special point of [destroying the Druidic center on the island of Angelsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_conquest_of_Anglesey), even though it was militarily insignificant.

In Judea, the Romans repeatedly experimented with forcing the imperial cult onto unwilling Jews, recycling a policy that the Greek Seleucid empire had tried before. The results were just as bad as they had been the first time: between 66 and 136 there were three vicious wars against the Jews in Judea and Egypt, terminating in the ethnic cleansing of Judea and of many Jewish communities from Syria to Tunisia. Vespasian and Titus destroyed the Jewish temple, the center of their religion. Hadrian didn’t just build a big temple to Jupiter on the ruins of the Temple in Jerusalem — he also [suppressed the study of the Torah, outlawed circumcision, and forbade Jews to observe the Sabbath](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7015-hadrian), as well as forcing Jews throughout the empire to pay a special tax.

_Titus and his soldiers embrace diversity by carrying off the contents of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, 70._ 

But the Romans didn’t confine their embrace to exotic foreigners. Even the familiar Greek cults were not treated with unfailing respect. In 186–7 BC, the [Senate outlawed the worship of Bacchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senatus_consultum_de_Bacchanalibus), which they regarded as a foreign imposition on good old fashioned Italian ways. The suppression of the Bacchantes was extremely thorough: private meetings were prohibited, priests of Bacchus were arrested, and ultimately more than 7,000 people were executed. A limited, state-designed version of the Bacchic rites was allowed but only under the watchful eye of the authorities. The prosecuting consul justified the persecution with this example of Roman tolerance:

> How often, in the times of our fathers and our grandfathers, has the task been assigned to the magistrates of forbidding the introduction of foreign cults, of excluding dabblers in sacrifices and fortune-tellers from the Forum, the Circus, and the City, of searching out and burning books of prophecies, and of annulling every system of sacrifice except that performed in the Roman way.

Livy, 39.15

The suppression of the Bacchantes was a particularly violent example, but it was hardly unique. Throughout the early history of Rome the Senate repeatedly expelled foreign religious practitioners from the city itself, along with soothsayers and astrologers — anyone, in short, who was likely to disturb the social order. As with Bacchus, the Senate [repeatedly tried to shut down the spread of Egyptian gods like Isis and Serapis](http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2011/10/27/isis-and-valerius-maximus/) in Italy — in one case a Roman consul personally demolished a temple of Isis in the city to set an example; as late as the time of Tiberius, an Isis temple in Rome [was shuttered and it’s priests crucified](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D18%3Awhiston+chapter%3D3%3Awhiston+section%3D4) for their “lascivious” foreign practices.

And all that is _before_ the Romans really got into their swing as persecutors.

Roman politics was frequently violent: about half of all emperors were coup leaders. Many of them tried to enhance their claims to legitimacy by scapegoating vulnerable minorities. This pattern started as early as 64, when Nero [pinned the blame for the Great Fire of Rome on the Christians](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/tacitus/tacitus-on-the-christians/). For the next three centuries political embarrassments, military defeats, or natural disasters could be blamed on religious outliers. The Christians were the most common targets, but not the only scapegoats: Diocletian, for example, burned Manichaean writings and Manichaean clergy as well as Christians. The key was to find an unpopular minority to bear the blame. As one of the targets complained, _Si Tiberis ascendit in moenia, si Nilus non ascendit in arva, si caelum stetit, si terra movit, si fames, si lues, statim Christianos ad leonem! adclamatur_ . “If the Tiber rises to the walls, if the Nile doesn’t rise to the fields, if the heavens thunder or the earth moves, if there is a famine, a plague — the cry goes up right away “Christians to the Lion!” (Tertullian, _Apologeticum_ 40).

But you don’t need lurid stories of children thrown to the lions (although that did, in fact, happen) to get a sense of the extent of Roman tolerance. Just listen to the Pliny the younger, a mild-mannered mid-ranking bureaucrat writing back to emperor Trajan for advice:

> __Pliny to the Emperor Trajan__ 

> It is my practice, my lord, to refer to you all matters concerning which I am in doubt. For who can better give guidance to my hesitation or inform my ignorance? I have never participated in trials of Christians. I therefore do not know what offenses it is the practice to punish or investigate, and to what extent. And I have been not a little hesitant as to whether there should be any distinction on account of age or no difference between the very young and the more mature; whether pardon is to be granted for repentance, or, if a man has once been a Christian, it does him no good to have ceased to be one; whether the name itself, even without offenses, or only the offenses associated with the name are to be punished.

> Meanwhile, in the case of those who were denounced to me as Christians, I have observed the following procedure: I interrogated these as to whether they were Christians; those who confessed I interrogated a second and a third time, threatening them with punishment; those who persisted I ordered executed. For I had no doubt that, whatever the nature of their creed, stubbornness and inflexible obstinacy surely deserve to be punished. There were others possessed of the same folly; but because they were Roman citizens, I signed an order for them to be transferred to Rome.

> Soon accusations spread, as usually happens, because of the proceedings going on, and several incidents occurred. An anonymous document was published containing the names of many persons. Those who denied that they were or had been Christians, when they invoked the gods in words dictated by me, offered prayer with incense and wine to your image, which I had ordered to be brought for this purpose together with statues of the gods, and moreover cursed Christ--none of which those who are really Christians, it is said, can be forced to do--these I thought should be discharged. Others named by the informer declared that they were Christians, but then denied it, asserting that they had been but had ceased to be, some three years before, others many years, some as much as twenty-five years. They all worshipped your image and the statues of the gods, and cursed Christ.

> They asserted, however, that the sum and substance of their fault or error had been that they were accustomed to meet on a fixed day before dawn and sing responsively a hymn to Christ as to a god, and to bind themselves by oath, not to some crime, but not to commit fraud, theft, or adultery, not falsify their trust, nor to refuse to return a trust when called upon to do so. When this was over, it was their custom to depart and to assemble again to partake of food--but ordinary and innocent food. Even this, they affirmed, they had ceased to do after my edict by which, in accordance with your instructions, I had forbidden political associations. Accordingly, I judged it all the more necessary to find out what the truth was by torturing two female slaves who were called deaconesses. But I discovered nothing else but depraved, excessive superstition.

> I therefore postponed the investigation and hastened to consult you. For the matter seemed to me to warrant consulting you, especially because of the number involved. For many persons of every age, every rank, and also of both sexes are and will be endangered. For the contagion of this superstition has spread not only to the cities but also to the villages and farms. But it seems possible to check and cure it. It is certainly quite clear that the temples, which had been almost deserted, have begun to be frequented, that the established religious rites, long neglected, are being resumed, and that from everywhere sacrificial animals are coming, for which until now very few purchasers could be found. Hence it is easy to imagine what a multitude of people can be reformed if an opportunity for repentance is afforded.

> __Trajan to Pliny__ 

> You observed proper procedure, my dear Pliny, in sifting the cases of those who had been denounced to you as Christians. For it is not possible to lay down any general rule to serve as a kind of fixed standard. They are not to be sought out; if they are denounced and proved guilty, they are to be punished, with this reservation, that whoever denies that he is a Christian and really proves it--that is, by worshiping our gods--even though he was under suspicion in the past, shall obtain pardon through repentance. But anonymously posted accusations ought to have no place in any prosecution. For this is both a dangerous kind of precedent and out of keeping with the spirit of our age.

So Trajan — _not_ one of the enthusiastic persecutors like Diocletian or Galerius— is decent enough not to hunt people down on the basis of secret denunciations (“out of keeping with the spirit of our age,” as he observes mildly). However he offers no demurral when his agents torture and execute people for being accustomed to meet on a fixed day before dawn and sing a hymn. Pliny, a liberal intellectual, is more than happy to provide the accused a way out: you aren’t liable to be executed if you prostrate yourself before Roman gods and the image of the emperor and curse your own god! As for the ones who refused, well, it’s a shame, but “whatever the nature of their creed, stubbornness and inflexible obstinacy surely deserve to be punished.”



As you can see, the question is founded on a shaky premise. By the time the Christians got around to persecuting in turn they’d had several centuries of learning from experts.
