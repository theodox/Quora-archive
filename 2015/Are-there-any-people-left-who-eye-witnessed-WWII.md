There are still quite a few. The last veteran of World War I only died in 2012 -- I actually met several WWI veterans between 2003 and 2005 while helping a friend research [The Last of the Doughboys: The Forgotten Generation and Their Forgotten World War](http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Doughboys-Forgotten-Generation/dp/0544290488), an oral history of WWI told by veterans. The pool of WWII survivors is larger (for the same distance in time) both because the war itself encompassed even more people and because the WWII cohort has lived to benefit from more modern medical techniques.
