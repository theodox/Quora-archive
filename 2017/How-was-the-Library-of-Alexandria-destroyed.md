There are a few different “destructions” of the library, but[ the main culprit is (inadvertently) Julius Caesar.](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Julius-Caesar-burn-down-the-library-of-Alexandria/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=0f72f940&srid=zLvM)

__Caesar__ 

The legendary library — the unmatched collection of books assembled by the early Ptolemies, estimated at between 500,00 to 700,000 scrolls* — was destroyed accidentally [when Julius Caesar took Alexandria in 47 BC.](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/greece/paganism/library.html) There’s a good roundup of the sources [here.](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/greece/paganism/library.html)

A fraction, at least, of the library was restored by Marc Antony. During his dalliance with Cleopatra, he gave her the contents of the [Library of Pergamum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Pergamum) to help replace books destroyed in Caesar’s fire. This was a substantial collection — about 200,000 scrolls — but it was significantly smaller than the original.

Its not clear if even this smaller collection survived the war between Augustus and Antony that ended in 27 BC, when the city was taken again. The travelogue of Strabo, about 50 years later has only this to say:

> The Museion is a part of the palaces. It has a public walk, and a place furnished with seats, and a large hall, in which men of learning, who belong to the Museion, take their common meal. This community possesses also property in common; and a priest, formerly appointed by the kings, but at present [Augustus's day] by Caesar, presides over the Museion.

The Museion, or “Temple of the Muses” is what pretty much all later sources refer to. It included lecture facilities and financial support for the “men of learning”, but there are no later mentions of the large library. Elsewhere Strabo says that the one-time chief Librarian, Eratotosthenes was “well supplied [with books] if he had a library as large as Hipparchus says it was,” which seems seems a clear admission that Eratosthenes’ library was no longer around.

It does have to be said that the earliest sources don’t actually state unambiguously that the Caesar destroyed the library — probably because nobody wanted to come out and directly accuse the founder of the imperial house of destroying a cultural touchstone. The first direct reference is made by Seneca, offhandedly in 49 who noted that the books were only there as form of ostentation anyway (Seneca’s patron, Nero, was a Julio-Claudian, so at least nominally a member of Caesar’s family).

By 180 [Aulus Gellius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/gellius/7*.html) writes

> an enormous quantity of books, nearly seven hundred thousand volumes, was either acquired or written in Egypt under the kings known as Ptolemies; but these were all burned during the sack of the city in our first war with Alexandria, not intentionally or by anyone's order, but accidentally by the auxiliary soldiers

There was, however, still some kind of institutional continuity in the first century. Claudius either founded a new Museion or expanded and refitted the older one: we’ve found an inscription showing that [Tiberius Claudius Balbilus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Claudius_Balbilus) — court astrologer to Claudius and Nero — was appointed the high priest of the Museion the Library some time in the 50’s. [Athenaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenaeus) quoted a play calling Claudius’ new institute a “[school for parasites](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Athenaeus/6C*.html)”, suggesting that perhaps the scholarship was less than top-notch. The place’s charter required that Claudius’ history of the Etruscans be read aloud every year.

_The inscription to Balbilus, Librarian under Claudius_ 

Hadrian visited Egypt in 130, and he visited the Museion. He debated with the scholars (it’s noted, wryly, that he “[propounded many questions to the teachers and answered himself what he had propounded](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/2*.html).”) It may be that imperial Roman support turned the Museion into more of an honorary award than a functioning center of scholarship: Philostratus, in his [Lives of the Sophists](http://trisagionseraph.tripod.com/Texts/Lives.html) (written in the early 200’s) describes it like this:

> By the Museum I mean a dining-table in Egypt to which are invited the most distinguished men of all countries.

So the Museion — with, one assumes, some kind of library but _not_  the massive collection of earlier times — continued in attenuated operation. However it was not the dominant cultural force it had been under the Ptolemies. Alexandria was now a provincial outpost of Rome, not the capital of a wealthy kingdom eager to advertise its status. But things were about to get worse.

__Caracalla__ 

The Museion as an institution probably survived the reign of Caracalla, who [massacred a large fraction of the city’s population](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/texts/Cassius_Dio/78*.html) when the Alexandrians (famous for their humorous put-downs of those in power) mocked him. According to Cassius Dio

> Toward the philosophers who were called Aristotelians he showed bitter hatred in every way, even going so far as to desire to burn their books, and in particular he abolished their common messes in Alexandria and all the other privileges that they had enjoyed.

However this must have been a temporary measure, since Caracalla died before the lines quoted from Philostratus above.

__Aurelian and Zenobia__ 

However this reprieve was short lived. Shortly after Caracalla, the Roman world slid into the 50 years of chaos known as the [Crisis of the Third Century.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century)

In the very pit of the anarchy [Zenobia](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-Zenobia), the Queen of Palmyra, conquered Egypt and tried to detach it from the Roman Empire. Emperor Aurelian drove her out in 273 — but in the process he leveled the entire royal quarter where the Museion and whatever library it possessed were located. [Ammianus Marcellinus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/22*.html), writing in the late 300’s put it this way:

> … many years later under the rule of Aurelian, the quarrels of the citizens turned into deadly strife; then her walls were destroyed and she lost the greater part of the district called Bruchion, which had long been the abode of distinguished men. From there came Aristarchus, eminent in thorny problems of grammatical lore, and Herodian, a most accurate investigator in science and Saccas Ammonius, the teacher of Plotinus, and numerous other writers in many famous branches of literature….

The devastation was very complete (or, perhaps, it was further extended when the city was stormed a second time under Diocletian, in 298). Writing in 392, Epiphanius of Cyprus said

> After the first Ptolemy, the second who reigned over Alexandria, the Ptolemy called Philadelphus, as has already been said was a lover of the beautiful and a lover of learning. He established a library in the same city of Alexander, in the area called the Bruchion; this is a quarter of the city today lying waste.

The Brucheion itself is now mostly underwater — a process that started with [the devastating tsunami of 365,](https://www.quora.com/Has-the-Eastern-Mediterranean-Israel-Lebanon-etc-ever-had-a-Tsunami/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=c69793b9&srid=zLvM) but we don’t really know how quickly the submersion of Alexandria’s seaward side progressed.

__Other libraries, other destructions__ 

A huge amount of ink has been expended on whether or not the library lived on in the [Serapeum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapeum), a temple complex which also housed a book collection of some kind. It may be that the collection there is the same one described as an “outer” or “public” library in the Ptolemaic period — a smaller collection of 42,000 scrolls. The Serapeum was destroyed by a Christian mob in 391, although there is no record of a destruction of books.

There’s also a much later story that when the Arab armies took Alexandria in 642 the Christian philosopher [John Philoponus ](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/)asked the Caliph to spare the library. The Caliph is said to have replied that anything in the books which agreed with the Quran was superfluous, and anything which disagreed was to be destroyed — and then he sent the book to be fuel for the public baths. The problem with this pithy story is that Philoponus would have to have lived to be 150 years old or so to make it possible; it’s safe to discount this version at least.

Both of these later stories miss the point (and the latter is flat out impossible). _Books are mortal_ : even if there Caesar’s troops had spared the library, every one of those hundreds of thousands of scrolls would have had to be recopied about once every century for the collection to survive. The ones that no one cared to copy would disappear without drama: well over 9 out of every 10 books written in antiquity are lost not because of Alexandria, but because nobody felt the need — or had the money — to keep recopying them.

The more important takeaway, though is that the destruction of the Ptolemaic collection in Caesar’s day, and of the Museion in Aurelian’s did not destroy the Alexandrian intellectual tradition. Ammianus finished his account of the Bruchion like this:

> And although very many writers flourished in early times as well as these whom I have mentioned, nevertheless not even to‑day is learning of various kinds silent in that same city; for the teachers of the arts show signs of life, and the geometrical measuring-rod brings to light whatever is concealed, the stream of music is not yet wholly dried up among them, harmony is not reduced to silence, the consideration of the motion of the universe and of the stars is still kept warm with some, few though they be, and there are others who are skilled in numbers; and a few besides are versed in the knowledge which reveals the course of the fates.

Although this certainly shows the deteriorating circumstances of a shrinking Roman world — Ammianus’ Alexandria has probably half the population of Cleopatra’s — it’s worth pointing out that more than a century after Ammianus, when [Emperor Justinian shuttered the Platonic Academy](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Emperor-Justinian-close-the-revived-Platonic-Academy) in Athens, the last head of the Academy and his chief sparring partner (the actual John Philoponus) were former fellow students in Alexandria, where they debated Plato and Aristotle in much the same manner as their predecessors had almost a thousand years before.

[The physical loss of books is a sympton, not a cause of the end of antiquity.](https://www.quora.com/Which-ancient-librarys-destruction-represents-the-greater-historical-loss-between-Alexandria-and-Baghdad) The biggest libraries in Rome both burned down in the first century, for example — but they were replenished because the emperors sent out copyists to make replacements from all over the world (including Alexandria). The Alexandrian corpus disappeared not because someone destroyed it, but because nobody had either the money or the will to save it.

_*It’s very important to remember that the scroll count is not the same as the count of works. The_ Iliad_, for example, takes 24 scrolls, Euclid’s_ Elements_takes 13, and Livy’s history of Rome requires 142._ 

_Another way to think about it is that a scroll is probably around 10,000 words: The_ Encylopedia Britannica_would take up about 4,400 scrolls, but it’s only 32 (hefty) volumes. The Ptolemaic Library could have contained less than 6,000 volumes that size._
