Because there language is highly distinctive — and it clearly ain’t Latin.

There are several Italic languages which look a lot like Latin if you squint — Oscan, Faliscan and Umbrian to name a few. But Etruscan is a very different beast. If it has relatives at all they are equally obscure — Lemnian and Rhaetic are the potentially related languages usually cited but all three are so poorly attested that it’s very hard to be sure. Etruscan is the only one of the three for which there are any substantial texts (though there are precious few) but those make clear that the grammar and vocabulary of the language were quite distinct. Etruscan is agglutinative (words build meaning through add-ons, like in Hungarian or Berber). It also distinguishes between animate and inanimate nouns grammatically, something Latin does not do. And its vocabulary is mostly non-Indo-European.

In short, Etruscan comes from a linguistic cabinet of curiosities — there’s a reason the Romans used it whenever they wanted to produce mumbo-jumbo for magical or entertainment purposes. A Roman could probably work out a way to talk to pretty much anybody else from Gaul all the way down to the Heel of Italy but Etruscan would always sound like gibberish.

The above says the same thing in both languages so you can see how little they overlap:

Latin :_L[UCIUS].CAFATIUS.L[UCI].F[ILIUS].STE[LLATINA TRIBU].HARUSPEX.FULGURIATOR_ 
Etruscan: _CAFFATES.L[A]R[TH].L[A]R[IS].NETŚVIS.TRVTNUT.FRONTAC_
