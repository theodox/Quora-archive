There are an infinity of choices. 

 Unity is very common but there are a number of popular engines. 2D vs 3D is a big differentiator, and the target platform matters a lot: only a handful of engines will run on an iPhone (one of the keys' to Unity's early success was that it let you develop for iPhones without forcing you to learn Objective ) . On PCs there are a lot of choices, from open source versions of old game engines to community projects to the indie licenses of heavy hitter AAA engines like Unreal and Crytek. Until a few years ago, Adobe Flash was a huge indie game playground but it has tailed off quite fast of late.

There's also the not invented here factor: even though using an off-the-shelf engine makes excellent financial and technical sense, indies aren't always willing to march to the beat of somebody else's drum. More than half of the dozen or so indie outfits I know personally wrote their own engines (typically in C++, since most of the folks I know are dropouts from the 'straight' games industry). 

The one place where there is a lot of standardization is the tools used to make the art. Photoshop is almost universal for bitmap art, and 3dsMax or Maya will usually be the source of the 3d models (although Blender has gotten pretty good, and is free).
