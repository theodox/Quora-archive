The relationship is pretty funky.

It’s pretty easy to show that Greek letterforms are ultimately derived from the mix of Semitic language speakers and Egyptian writing.

[This one ](http://farrago-cambridge.blogspot.com/2015/06/notes-on-inscriptions-nikandres-central.html)— from around 650 BC, so seven or eight hundred years before the oldest examples of written Coptic — is not the oldest existing Greek inscription (the oldest is about 150 years earlier) but it’s a good example of a very early one — and unlike most older ones its very legible and has a lot of characters.

It reads, more or less, “Nikandre, the excellent daughter of Deinodikes of Naxos, sister of Deinomenes, (now) wife of Phraxos, dedicated me to the far-shooter of arrows (= Artemis).” The writing, however, is a bit odd if you’re used to classical Greek: The first word “Nikandre” is written ΝΙΚΑΝΔΡΘ rather than ΝΙΚΑΝΔΡΗ because the character Θ which later Greek uses for _TH_  was at this point being used for what Greek later wrote as Η — the long vowel sound _eta,_ sounding similar to the _ea_ in _eat._ 

If you walk through just the first few characters you can get a sense of the geneaology. What the we write as __N__ is here written very much like the Phoenician character __𐤍__ (the first one is hard to read but it recurs more clearly in the 5th place). [In Phoenician that character — which the Greeks called nu — is known as nūn, which means “serpent” or snake.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun_(letter)#Origins) And its distinctive form comes from the Egyptian hieroglyph __𓆓__ which is… a snake. Now[ in Egyptian that character either represents an actual snake or a sound like “dj”.](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Cobra_at_rest_(dj_hieroglyph)) What that tells us is that Greeks got it from a Semitic language that used [acrophonic naming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophony): whoever taught the Greeks to write saw hieroglyphic characters, then named the things those characters depicted in their own language gave the sound values to the characters from those names.

You can see that in this inscription with __K__ , “kappa”, which comes from the Phoenician __𐤊__ “[kaph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaph)”. This seems to be a simplified version of the [hieroglyph for a hand, 𓂩, which is pronounced d or ḏrt.](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Hand_(d_hieroglyph)) __A__ , “alpha”, is the most famous example of all — it’s 𐤀, _“aleph”_  in Phoenician — the word for Ox. And it’s very clearly derived from the hieroglyph __𓃾__ — a picture of an ox, but pronounced something like “ka”. The Greeks wrote “R” as __Ρ__ , from the Phoenician 𐤓. “rosh” or “head.” It’s hieroglyphic grandparent is 𓁶 which would be pronounced “_tp”._ 

There are still some unanswered questions — the Greek Δ “delta” is the Phoenician 𐤃, _“_ _[daleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalet)_ _,_ a door” but it’s not obvious what the matching hieroglyph is. However the pattern is clear: the Greek letter names don’t mean anything but the Phoenician ones are all meaningful words related to the letter forms. The pictures use Egyptian graphic conventions but don’t reproduce Egyptian sounds or their logographic meanings — by the time the symbols get to Greece, around the 9th century BC, they are just graphics with funny-sounding foreign names. Since the names tell you the sounds of the graphics they were retained — but as meaningless sounds. It’s worth mentioning that those same names survive in other languages unrelated to Greek — Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac and [Ancient South Arabian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_South_Arabian_script) along with its descendants in Ethiopia. Only in Phoenician and its closest relatives to the letter names have actual meanings.

Actually there’s a slight exception to that, and it’s telling. Three Greek letters have somewhat meaningful names: _omicron_  and _omega_  are, literally, “little o” and “big o”. And _upsilon_ means “simple u”.



So here are the letter names in Coptic:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e462468c085f81bdbb6d2be887e5d2f2)

You’ll notice that almost all of these are identical to their Greek equivalents — _alpha, vita, gamma, delta_ for Greek _alpha, beta_ , _gamma, delta_ and so on. There are six (seven, in the Bohairic dialect) letters with no Greek counterparts: Ϣ (“sh”), Ϥ (“f”), Ϩ (“h”), Ϫ (“j”), Ϭ (“g”), Ϯ (“ti”). One thing to notice is that they all come at the end of the Coptic alphabet — this is c[ommon to most scripts that add new characters; it’s why our Y and Z (which were added to the Greek-derived Latin alphabet) come so late. ](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-the-alphabet-letters-put-in-the-order-we-know/answer/Steve-Theodore)But all of these characters have clear antecedents in the [Demotic Egyptian script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)), which was the way ordinary Egyptians wrote when they were not trying to imitate the Pharaohs. This looks a lot like somebody who was already literate in Demotic adopting Greek characters but keeping familiar symbols to write sounds Greek didn’t do well.

The oldest known example of Egyptian language written in Greek-like characters is this:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-375c069a81e68fef35d44fe8a08b28ad)

[This inscription dates to around 189 BC](https://www.quora.com/What-factual-evidence-do-novice-and-professional-linguists-give-to-show-against-evidence-from-Jean-Francois-Champollion-that-Coptic-is-derived-from-Greek/answer/Steve-Theodore), during the rebellion of the Egyptian pharaoh [Horwennefer](http://www.instonebrewer.com/TyndaleSites/Egypt/ptolemies/horwennefer.htm#Horwennefer) against the Ptolemies. It’s written using Greek characters but it is not legible in Greek; instead is (depending on where you want to draw the line) later Demotic Egyptian or very early Coptic. You’ll note that the writer had some trouble with the spellings: he had to write ΠΟΡW YΡΓΟΝΑΦΟΡ “poroh urgonaphor” for what would have sounded something like “parro horwennefer” to us — Coptic would later add Ϩ and Ϥ to capture the “h” and “f” in Horwennefer. A Greek would have tried to write “pharaoh” as φαραώ. So this is clearly a transitional text.

It’s also worth pointing out that Coptic kept the letter names which did mean something _in Greek_ : the Coptic letter Ⲩ is sometimes called _ua_  from is sound value but it’s also known as _epsilon —_ as slight mispronunciation of it’s Greek name _u-psilon._  The chart above doesn’t show them, but it’s common for Coptic abecedaries to retain the names _omicron_ and _omega._ If Greek were derived from Coptic, you’d expect to see that reversed: you’d see Greek letters whose names had meaning in Egyptian (not Phoenician) and you would certainly not expect to see Coptic letters whose names were Greek.

That — plus the fact that the Greeks themselves always said they got their letters from Phoenicia makes it really hard to make the case that Greek derives from Coptic.

Finally it’s worth pointing out that there are two other forms of written Greek, which let us observe the evolution of the Greek language independent of the evolution of the Greek _alphabet_ . The Bronze age [Linear B script ](https://www.quora.com/How-similar-was-Linear-B-Greek-Mycenaean-Greek-to-the-Ancient-Greek-language/answer/Steve-Theodore)dates back to around 1450 BC — it’s somewhat older than King Tut. But it encodes recognizable Greek vocabulary and grammar. Even though it uses as clunky syllabic writing method we can see familiar Greek words and names., Even the word _ai-ku-pi-ti-jo,_ “aegyptios” — that is, “Egyptian” . Interestingly Linear B sometimes uses _mi-sa-ra-jo_  “misraios” from the Semitc word _misr_ , which is the way Egyptians refer to their own country in nowadays in Arabic — showing that Greeks were already in contact with both Egypt and Semitic-speaking Phoenicia during the Bronze Age. There’s also the [Cypriot syllabary](https://www.quora.com/When-did-the-Cypriot-syllabary-get-out-of-use-How-much-did-the-Greek-world-outside-Cyprus-know-about-it/answer/Steve-Theodore), a rare but long-lived Bronze Age Greek script which lasted from about 1000 BC until just after the time of Alexander (the last examples overlap with the luckless Horwennefer in the 2d century BC). Here again its easy to see the Greek language with its distinctive grammar and vocabulary on display several centuries before the oldest known Coptic writings.

For the record the [oldest examples of alphabetic Greek date from around the 8th century BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipylon_inscription). The [oldest Linear B tablets date to about 1450 BC](https://novoscriptorium.com/2019/06/22/linear-b-tablet-of-iklaina-greece-the-earliest-known-government-record-in-europe/). The oldest known Coptic writings — if you don’t count Horwennefer — come around the time time Romans took over in Egypt, mostly in the first century.

_The_ _[Old Coptic Schmidt Papyrus](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/helmut.satzinger/Texte/PapSchmidt.pdf)_ _, from around they year 100, is one of the oldest examples of Coptic._ 

One of the most striking aspects of the evolution of Coptic is that it’s “classic” form reflects the way Greek was written after around 200 BC — it’s not a linear derivative of the letter forms that Plato and Aristotle knew but one derived from the way those letters had changed during the Hellenistic era. The Horwennefer inscription is actually a lot closer to a classical era Greek script. Again, this shows how Coptic got its distinctive _look_ during the Greco-Roman period even though it’s linguistic roots go all the way back to the first pharaohs.
