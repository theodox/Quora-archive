# If we assume people in 100 AD did not know the year accurately, when did humankind start to record dates consistently relative to our calendar now?

The “AD” system of year numbers is usually ascribed to the work of [Dionysius Exiguus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_Exiguus), a 6th century Christian theologian — in the year 100, it was still four centuries in the future.

Serial year numbers were not common until well after Dionysius’ time. In our year 100 AD, the dominant dating system would have been the consular year, named for the two Roman consuls who held office that year. An ordinary Roman would probably have referred to that year as “ the consulate of emperor Trajan and Frontinus.” Scholarly Romans sometimes used the [Ab urbe condita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_urbe_condita) system, which begins with the legendary founding of Rome in 753 BC. Their Greek counterparts used the [Olympiad ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad)system based on the 4-year Olympic cycle which starts in our 776 BC. Neither of these systems were part of daily life, however — ordinary people used the consular dating and didn’t worry much about serial time.

In any case, Dionysius’ real interest was not in serial year numbering at all. He was involved in an argument about the proper time of year to celebrate Easter. His argument was a highly technical dissection of the interaction between the Roman solar year and the Jewish lunar calendar, and he went back through some centuries to illustrate the accuracy of his calculations. The Roman civil calendar of his day dated from the accessions of the emperor [Diocletian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian) (reigned 284–305), and he did not feel comfortable attaching his calculations to the name of Diocletian, who was an ardent persecutor of Christians. So, he re-centered the count to the what he though was the first year of the Christian era. Unfortunately, Dionysius didn’t record why he chose the 284-year offset: most earlier Christians who tried to come up with a date for the nativity gave dates that would be our 1 or 2 BC.

Diocletian’s calendar did gradually teach the habit of serial year numbering. However there were multiple competing systems, and even in the Christian world the AD/BC system was not universal. The Byzantine empire usually used the [Anno Mundi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Mundi) or “years since the creation” date, which was quite similar to but not exactly the same as the the modern Jewish year numbering system, reckoned from the supposed date of the creation of the world. On the other hand the Coptic church in Egypt continues to use the Diocletianic year — in their system this answer is written on Toba (January) 14, 1734.

All of these systems were slightly wonky. The modern calendar really only got permanently fixed to the solar year with the introduction of the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) in 1582; even then it took a couple of centuries for that calendar to be universally adopted in Europe much less the rest of the world.
