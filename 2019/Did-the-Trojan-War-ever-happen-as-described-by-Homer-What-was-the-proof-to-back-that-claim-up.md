“As described by Homer,” almost certainly not.

The odds that there was a Troy, and that it was destroyed around the time that the Greeks assigned to Homer’s story are very good. It’s not impossible that Agamemnon, Achilles, Helen and Hector are the names of historic people — but it’s hard to imagine that the historic people would be recognizable to us based solely on Homer’s words. The details of the action are generally not regarded as credible.

It’s widely recognized that the Iliad does preserve fragmentary glimpses of life in the late Bronze Age. There are details of weapons and armor, place names and even an uncomprehending mention of writing : all elements which had vanished almost five centuries before the poem took it’s final shape in the 8th century BC. Archaeologists have excavated Bronze Age centers at Mycenae and Argos and above all at Troy. We’ve even found documents from the Hittite empire that seem to place a prince named [Alaksandu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaksandu) (= Alexander, the other name of Paris) in charge of the city of [Wilusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilusa) (= Ilion, the other name of Troy), and records of conflicts with the [Ahhiyawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaeans_(Homer)#Hittite_documents) (= the Acheans). The usual scholarly guess is that the Homer’s Troy is what archaeologists call [Troy VIIa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_VII), a powerful walled city at which was destroyed about a decade after 1200 BC. The location of the site and the timing of the destruction (which is within a decade or so of the traditional Greek date for the end of Trojan war), plus the evidence of the Hittite documents, all point to a kernel of historical truth underlying the Iliad. It’s worth pointing out, though, that kernel can be pretty minimal — we can’t really be sure from the archaeological evidence that the Troy which burnt in 1190 BC was burnt by Greeks, or that the many named characters who seem to turn up in the Hittite or Mycenaean records actually overlapped in time at all: imagine a history written in 2519 which conflates the war against Hitler with the struggle against “Fascist” Donald Trump_(thanks again, Twitter)._

_This Hittite documents is a treaty with Alaksandu of Wilusa, a 13th century BC prince whose name and city sound a lot like “Alexander of Ilion”_ 

All that said, the _details_  of the conflict described by Homer are definitely not given much historical weight. Five centuries of oral tradition is a long time for dramatic details to accumulate and for events to become garbled. Studies of modern Greek oral epics — for example, the stories told by Cretan resistance fighters after World War II — demonstrate that oral tradition can perfectly preserve some details while introducing elements of romance and fantasy at the same time. The usual assumption is that the Iliad does the same: it recalls the names of princes and cities which had been dust for five centuries when the poems were finally written down, but in ways that don’t always make sense. For example, the poem knows that Mycenaean warriors fought with bronze, not iron weapons — though many people in the Iliad use iron tools. Chariots — manned, correctly, by a driver as well as a warrior — are everywhere but their usage make little sense, at least from what we know of chariotry in the Bronze Age armies of the Near East and Egypt. A message is sent in writing — but the poem treats this as a kind of magic, since the poem itself is an illiterate recreation of a literate era.

Above all, of course, many things in the story are flat-out impossible. Heroes routinely perform superhuman feats of strength, the gods intervene on the battlefield, seers predict the future… even if the traditions which became the Iliad started out as a commemoration of real events they accumulated a lot of special effects over the centuries.

The most famous parts of the story — the wrath of Achilles, the pettiness of Agamemnon, the sober heroism of Hector and Helen’s self-loathing — are not the sort of things that can ever by verified by archaeological means. They show the marks of genius in their characterizations and depth. Probably the best way to tell that the Iliad is not history is simple: _it’s too well written._
