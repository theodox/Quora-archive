In the 14th and 15th centuries the Genoese outpost at [Caffa](http:///) (today, Feodosia in the debated Crimea) was a key part of the slave trade linking western Europe, the Islamic world, and the Slavic world.

In theory, at least, the Genoese abided by the Church policy that forbade Christians to be sold into slavery. The ___Officium Sancti Antonii___ __ , or in its long form the “office of St. Anthony” the Genoese commission that was intended to ensure that no Christians and no one willing to be baptized was sold into slavery in the Islamic world. Slavers, of course, tend not to be particularly scrupulous about laws which limit their ability to sell people, and Genoa’s reputation among it’s Italian contemporaries was rather shady — unsurprisingly, the _Officium_  was not particularly effective at policing the trade.

_An early example of the complex history of the Crimea — this map shows the situation around 1450, with the Genoese territories of “Gazaria”, the Byzantine statelet known as the_ _[Principality of Theodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Theodoro)_ _, and_ _[Khanate of Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Khanate)_ _, one of the successors of the_ _[Golden Horde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horde)_ _. The area was eventually conquered by Russia in 1783. Image: Wikipedia_ 

There were periodic efforts at limiting the flow of slaves — though generally on political rather than moral grounds. A lot depended on how the Genoese were feeling about the Golden Horde and later the Crimean Tatars, the Turks in Asia Minor, the Mamelukes in Egypt and the Levant, the Byzantines, and a host of smaller players. Together the _Officium Sancti Antonii_ and the _Officium Gazarae,_  the “Khazar office” had to maintain good relations with both suppliers and customers while also safeguarding Genoa’s commercial position (in particular, against the Venetians).

The ban in 1431 was part of this complex set of politics: it was one of the periodic edicts which tried to limit the flow of slaves either to the Turks or to Egypt at various times, mostly because the Egyptian Mamelukes and the Ottoman Turks both used slave soldiers. These bans tended to come and go as Genoa’s political interests in the balance of power in the east dictated.

In this case the ban is also connected to the Pope’s condemnation of the Caffa slave traders in 1425 and again in 1434. The Genoese advertised (if not necessarily always following through on) efforts to prevent Christians being sold to non-Christians, to encourage conversions through the option of escape from slavery, and to deny possible recruits to the Turks, then making inroads against Greece and the Balkans. The Genoese war also fighting the Venetians in the Black Sea, so looking like good Christians at home in Italy was unusually important at this time.

__Side note__ : The name “Office of St. Anthony” comes, I think, from the name of one of the key towers which formed the city’s defenses, the “Tower of St. Anthony” rather than from anything more theological. However I could not find a solid reference to back that hunch.
