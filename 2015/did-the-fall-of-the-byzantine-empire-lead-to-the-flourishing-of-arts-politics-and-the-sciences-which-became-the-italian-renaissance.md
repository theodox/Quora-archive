"Renaissance" is a bit of a squishy term, which tends to get used somewhat differently in different contexts. So: looong answer :) _TLDR way at the bottom_ 

In literature, the Renaissance really started with the expansion of non-aristocratic culture in the Italian city-states, which -- depending on how you want to look at it -- is a product of the later 13th or the 14th century: literary figures like [ Boccaccio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Boccaccio) and [Petrarch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch) are usually regarded as 'Renaissance' authors though both were born around 1300. Even [Dante ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri)shows many key Renaissance interests, particularly in his careful attention to classical literature, and he is only a generation before those two. All of this is, of course, well before the fall of Constantinople and really driven by the interaction of vernacular and Latin literature.

In the visual arts, the classic 'Renaissance' figures like Michaelangelo, Raphael and Leonardo flourished in the early 16th century; to most modern eyes somebody like [Fra Angelico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fra_Angelico) (ca 1430) has a certain 'medieval' air with less mastery of 3D space and form than the later painters, but his work is clearly influenced by ancient models as well as by Gothic traditions, while [Giotto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giotto) ( ca 1300) seems firmly in the medieval camp even though his actual handling of the subject matter shows a lot of the attention to human detail and emotion which eventually came to characterize the Renaissance in the history books. If I had to pick a turning point myself, I'd pick the career of [Filippo Brunelleschi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Brunelleschi) (1377-1446), who was a true 'renaissance man': not only was he a brilliant architect and accomplished painter, he also holds the first industrial patent (for the cranes he invented to build the [Duomo](http://www.ilgrandemuseodelduomo.it/#cattedrale)) and 'hacked' the optical basis of perspective drawing (his insights were given a more formal basis by [Leon Battista Alberti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Battista_Alberti) soon after). The combination of technical ingenuity and new theories of perception really created the 'Renaissance' we know from the art history books... 

well, that and the existence of people rich enough to buy all those beautiful statues, paintings and buildings.... Many Byzantine treasures certainly ended up in Italy, and both Venice and Naples retained distinctly 'Byzantine' tastes long after the new styles were becoming dominant in Florence and central Italy. But so much of the Renaissance style is a reaction against the iconostatic Byzantine style that it's hard to see Byzantine influence as a driver in this field (and the Byzantines had an almost Islamic aversion to sculpture, so their influence there was even more limited).

 The last, less sexy version of the Renaissance is the startling rise of the Italian economy. Several factors played into the rise of the city-states. The [wars between the papacy and the Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guelphs_and_Ghibellines) left many of the cities largely independent of feudal control, fostering a more mercantile, urban culture that was interested in trade and industry rather than agriculture and warfare; several Italian cities - notably Genoa, Venice, Pisa and Lucca contributed fleets to the Crusades accumulating plunder and more importantly monopolizing trade routes to the East (including to Byzantium); and the growth of an urban middle class -- very rare in the rest of Europe -- fueled investments in everything from cloth to metallurgy. Finally the less-feudal, more commercial outlook in the city-states encouraged the growth of finance -- Italy became the banking center of Europe (our word 'bank' comes from _banca_ , "table" : the counting tables of the Medicis and other Italian bankers) . 

On the less appetizing side, Italian states (particularly Venice) also appropriated big swathes of Byzantine territory: Cyprus, Rhodes and most of the other Greek Islands, and isolated forts and trading posts throughout the eastern and southern Mediterranean, which both helped maintain their predominant position in trade and also brought plenty of spoils home.

All that added up to wealth: pretty unprecedented wealth by medieval European standards. And that wealth brought with it a huge explosion in culture, simply because Italy could afford to support poets and painters, sculptors and architects and scientists. It's no accident that we know so many works of art through their wealthy patrons: the Medicis, the Sforzas, the Barberini and so on.

It is certainly true that individual Greek migrants -- like [Manuel Chrysoloras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Chrysoloras) or [Basilios Bessarion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilios_Bessarion) -- made important contributions to the recovery of ancient texts and the rapid acquisition of Greek manuscripts by Italian collectors. We don't have great sources for the humbler contributions of Greeks to growth of either the economy or technology, but we know that there were thousands of Greeks living in Italy (4,000 in Venice alone) Some of these certainly brought trade secrets, family connections and portable wealth to Italy. Crete - under Venetian political control, remained an important center of Byzantine art and culture after the fall of Constantinople, remaining a living link to the Byzantine tradition.

Still, Greek studies remained fairly esoteric until the 16th century. Interestingly, the biggest class of works to come westward in the 15th and 16th centuries were not technical works -- many of which had already reached Europe via Arabic translations or reworkings -- but historical and literary works which had gone out of circulation in the west: It's widely thought that Machiavelli drew heavily on [Polybius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius), but no one has yet found out where he would have found a translation. The flowering of political philosophy in the 16th and 17th century really _does_  owe a huge debt to the Byzantine scholiasts who saved Herodotus and Thucydides, Plutarch and Dio Cassius from oblivion.

TLDR: The Renaissance was a long and complex process: a unique combination of political and economic freedom, a nationalistic desire to reconnect with the glories of the Roman past, a boom-time economy that supported new kinds of art and literature, and the growing confidence of an educated, non-noble, non-clerical culture that was interested in more than prayer and glory. Byzantine culture contributed to it -- particularly by conserving Greek literature lost in the west, but also, sadly, in the form of plunder. Still it's not right to assign a determining or leading role to the Byzantine trade and cultural ties.
