It’s a Greek name. In legend, the princes [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(mythology)), a Phoenician, was abducted by Zeus in the form of a white bull, and he eloped with her across the sea to what we know call Europe — or more precisely to Crete, where she became the mother of king [Minos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos) and thus grandmother to the Minotaur.

The story surfaces around the 8th century BC, around the same time as the Iliad and the Odyssey. “Europe” as a place name appears soon thereafter.

Depending on your taste in explaining myths away:

It could be just a method of explaining a pre-existing name by attaching it to a story

It could reflect a garbled version of contacts between the Phoenicians and mainland Greece — Phoenician influence in Greece was very important in the ninth and eighth centuries BC, leading to among other things the Greek adaptation of the Phoenician alphabet

It could reflect a religious tradition linking Greek Zeus with the near eastern cult of Astarte … there’s a lot of options (well summarized in the wiki link above)

…none of which is an undeniable slam-dunk explanation.

It remains a bit of a puzzler why Europe stuck as a place name, since mythologically Europa never made it to the mainland of Greece. The name was well established by the time of [Herodotus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D4&force=y) (in the mid 5th century BC) who complained that its borders seemed arbitrary, since there was no clear agreement on when “Europe” became “Asia” north of the Black Sea. That fact suggests that the name goes back to people who were not very familiar with the Black Sea and didn’t know that what we call Asia Minor and Greece are connected by land if you go around the long way. Based on that the term may really be a Phoenician, rather than a Greek one in origin: some scholars try to derive it from _'ereb,_ the Phoenician word for “sunset” and thus for “west”.
