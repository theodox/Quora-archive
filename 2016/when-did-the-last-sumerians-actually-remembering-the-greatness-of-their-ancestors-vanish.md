It's hard to know: like Latin, Sumerian had a long afterlife. The hard dividing line -- the "fall of Sumeria" -- is in 1750 BC, more or less. But the gradual senescence of Sumerian culture was a much longer more complex process.

The political and linguistic independence of Sumeria had already begun to fade in the 23d century BC*, as the [Akkadian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire) rose to political dominance in Mesopotamia. Akkadian -- a Semitic language -- began to replace Sumerian as the language of everyday life even in the Sumerian heartland. However Akkadian culture was deeply indebted to Sumerian models and Sumerian remained an important language for literary and religious pursuits. 

The Akkadian-Sumerian 'co-dominion' lasted for a couple of hundred years, but collapsed in what seems to have been a climate-related period of domestic chaos and foreign invasions. The end of the Akkadian empire is sometimes referred to as the "Sumerian Dark Age", with a brief conquest by the [Gutians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutian_dynasty_of_Sumer) -- much less civilized and less beholden to Sumerian tradition - at its nadir (2150-2110 or so).

_The victory inscription of Utu-Hegal (ca 2113 BC) records the expulsion of the Gutian invaders and the brief Sumerian revival_  

The Gutians were ejected by the Sumerian [Third Dynasty of Ur](http://i-cias.com/e.o/ur.3rd_dynasty.htm), which heralded a brief but intense Sumerian revival. Among the other high points of this "[Sumerian Renaissance](http://thelastdiadoch.tumblr.com/post/142243360115/the-akkadians-and-the-sumerian-renaissance-bronze)" were the law code of [Ur-Nammu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Ur-Nammu) (which predates the more famous code of Hammurabi by more than two centuries) and some remarkable artwork. It's thought that this is also the period when the Gilgamesh epic was written down in its classic form.

_[Gudea of Lagash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudea)_ _(ca. 2144 - 2124) ruled independently of Ur, but was another example of the Sumerian revival marked by intense literary and artistic activity, like this brilliant portrait._ 

However at the same time the Akkadian language was still flourishing: new towns founded in this period received Akkadian, rather than Sumerian names. It's not clear how much this reflects demographic changes and how much is connected to social evolution. 

The Sumerian revival came to an end in another chaotic period. Starting around 2000 BC the [Amorites](http://www.ancient.eu/amorite/) -- a nomadic, Semitic people from modern Syria -- began pushing into Mesopotamia. The Sumerians -- whose ancient enemies, the Elamites, remained a persistent threat to the east -- were caught in a vise. Efforts to build a 'great wall' in the western desert failed, and Ur itself was destroyed in 1750. 

> Dead men, not potsherds. Covered the approaches. The walls were gaping, the high gates, the roads, were piled with dead. In the side streets, where feasting crows would gather, scattered they lay. In all the side streets and roadways bodies lay. In the open fields that used to fill with dancers, they lay in heaps. The country's blood now filled its holes, like metal in a mould; Bodies dissolved - like fat left in the sun.

This is generally regarded as the end of an independent Sumerian civilization, although of course old patterns remained in place. The drift towards Akkadian language accelerated, and foreigners sat on the thrones of many ancient cities, but the heritage of Sumerian thought and literature remained an important part of local life -- you could analogize the situation to the fall of Rome in the west, where high culture retained a Latin stamp long after the Caesars had departed.

Babylon -- a backwater town which achieved independence under an Amorite dynasty in the 19th century BC -- became the epicenter of a new southern Mesopotamian culture in which Akkadian language, Sumerian religious and literary traditions fused to create cultural pattern which survived down to the time of the Persian conquest in 540BC and beyond. To the north the Assyrians drew on the same sources of inspiration (with an admixture of militarism) to create another powerful empire with Sumerian echoes. [Ashurbanipal,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashurbanipal) the last great Assyrian emperor (668-620 BC) boasted of his mastery of the Sumerian language, and had himself depicted in Sumerian fashion in some of this official portraits.

_I read the cunning tablets of Sumer and the dark Akkadian language which is difficult to rightly use; I took my pleasure in reading stones inscribed before the flood._ ___Ashurbanipal___ _in the pose of a Sumerian_ ensi_, ca. 640 BC_ 

Cuneiform writing continued in limited use under the Persians (the modern decryption of cuneiform began with the [Behistun Inscription,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_Inscription) which was a deliberate bit of Persian propaganda written in a newly-invented Persian cuneiform). However the common a language of Persian, Greek and Roman Mesopotamia was Aramaic, which was written alphabetically. The last known cuneiform text is an astrology manual from the first century AD, though it's been argued that some limited cuneiform traditions may have lingered on to the 3rd century. 


_* The dating for much of the events in this period is under dispute in scholarly circles -- all the figures here may be debated by as much as 150 years. AFAIK the sequence given is not controversial, however. See_ _[Chronology of the ancient Near East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_ancient_Near_East)_
