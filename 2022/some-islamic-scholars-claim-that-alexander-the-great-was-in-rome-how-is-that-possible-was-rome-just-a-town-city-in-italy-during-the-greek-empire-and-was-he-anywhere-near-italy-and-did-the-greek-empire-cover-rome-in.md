# Some Islamic scholars claim that Alexander the Great was in Rome. How is that possible? Was Rome just a town/city in Italy during the Greek Empire, and was he anywhere near Italy? And did the Greek Empire cover Rome in Alexander's day?

Alexander’s place in several literary traditions doesn’t come from the original primary sources. In reality Alexander had nothing to do with Rome; Rome doesn’t show up in any Greek sources until about a generation after Alexander’s death.

The reason that Alexander shows up in specifically Islamic scholarship at all is that [he’s usually identified as the figure of Dhu al-Qarnayn ذُو ٱلْقَرْنَيْن , “He of the two horns” in the Quran ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhu_al-Qarnayn)is Alexander. Dhu al-Qarnayn builds the wall which is supposed to keep the Gog and Magog (Ya'juj and Ma'juj) penned up until the end of the world.

Obviously, as a Quranic figure, Alexander has been interesting to Islamic thought for a long time. However, for most of the last 1400 or so years, if you learned about Alexander in the Arab or Muslim world you weren’t reading about him in the original sources. For the most part, [Arab interest in Greek literature was eminently practical](https://www.quora.com/Where-and-how-were-the-ancient-Greek-texts-preserved-between-the-period-of-their-writing-and-the-time-when-they-were-found-and-translated-by-the-Arabs/answer/Steve-Theodore): math, medicine and astronomy were popular subjects; history and literature, not so much. Instead, the version of Alexander that spread in the Islamic era came from pop culture: specifically, from a collection of stories known as the “[Alexander Romance](http://www.attalus.org/info/alexander.html)” which spread very widely.

So, it’s not surprising that a lot of scholars produced interpretive material about Alexander which represented the widely diffused and often contradictory stories that circulated about Alexander. So much so, in fact, that many different communities claimed Alexander for their own. In the Greek text from Ptolemaic Egypt, Alexander turns out to be no Macedonian but actually [the child of a magical Egyptian wizard-pharaoh](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Demosthenes-anti-Macedonian-oration-used-so-much-by-modern-anti-Greek-propaganda-on-Macedonias-Greekness-when-Demosthenes-himself-said-that-Alexander-the-Great-was-Greek-Alexander-who-is-a-Greek-in-pseudo/answer/Steve-Theodore). The Jewish historian Josephus claimed that [Alexander took time off from his conquests to pay his respects to the Temple in Jerusalem](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/josephus/jewish-antiquities/alexander-the-great-visits-jerusalem/). In the Persian versions, [Alexander is actually a Persian](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-Persian-descriptions-of-Alexander-the-Great/answer/Steve-Theodore) — here, the Persian emperor “[Darab](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/darab-1#i)” (a confused remembrance of the historical Darius) fathers Alexander , so that his eventual conquest of Persia is not a humiliating foreign intrusion but a civil war.

The pre-Islamic Arab world was of course connected to all of these other cultures and their Alexander traditions. We don’t know if there was a pre-Islamic Arabic version of the Romance but it is clear Islamic versions of Alexander’s life began to appear by around the second Islamic century. This developed into a pretty robust literature with all sorts of interesting additions to the tradition. Repeating the familiar pattern, western Arabic authors [invented yet another parentage for Alexander in Al Andalus](https://brill.com/view/journals/stma/18/1/article-p48_3.xml) (paywalled). However the usage of “Rome” for Alexander shows clearly that eastern Arab writers were mostly following the Persian version of the story. This tradition, which most famously shows up in the works of the Persian poet [Ferdowsi ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdowsi)(early 11th century CE / 5th century AH). Here’s [how Ferdowsi describes Alexander’s parentage:](http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/page37.htm)

> [Darab] having put his army in order, he proceeded against Failakus, then king of Rum, [= Philip of Macedon] whom he defeated with great loss. Many were put to the sword, and the women and children carried into captivity. Failakus himself took refuge in the fortress of Amur [Amorium, the capitol of Byzantine Anatolia in the 7th - 9th centuries CE, destroyed by Abbasids in 838], from whence he sent an ambassador to Darab, saying, that if peace was only granted to him, he would willingly consent to any terms that might be demanded. When the ambassador arrived, Darab said to him: "If Failakus will bestow upon me his daughter, Nahid [[this name is that of an Iranian goddess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anahita)] , peace shall be instantly re-established between us--I require no other terms." Failakus readily agreed, and sent Nahid with numerous splendid presents to the king of Persia, who espoused her, and took her with him to his own country.

> [….] When she found she was likely to become a mother she did not communicate the circumstance, but requested permission to pay a visit to her father. The request was granted; and on her arrival in Rum she was delivered of a son. Failakus had no male offspring, and was overjoyed at this event, which he at once determined to keep unknown to Darab, publishing abroad that a son had been born in his house, and causing it to be understood that the child was his own. When the boy grew up, he was called Sikander [= Alexander]; and, like Rustem, became highly accomplished in all the arts of diplomacy and war. Failakus placed him under Aristatalis [= Aristotle], a sage of great renown, and he soon equalled his master in learning and science.

It’s an interesting mishmash of different time periods. Having Falaikus and Sikander as kings of “Rome” reflects the natural way for a Persian of the 10th century to talk about the Byzantine Empire — Alexander’s home town was only 600km from Constantinople, and Constantinople was still the capital of the Roman Empire even if it was a mostly Greek-speaking Roman empire. Making “Amur” an important fortress calls to mind the wars of the first Caliphate. The mention of Aristotle goes back to the original Greek version of the Alexander Romance, which gradually accumulated many fantastic stories of Alexander’s and Aristotle’s scientific explorations (for example, the famous story that Alexander investigated the bottom of the sea in a glass bubble)

_Alexander is lowered into the sea — a depiction from Mughal India, made by a Hindu artist for a Turkic dynasty in India based on a Persian poem derived from a Greek novel combined with a bit of pseudo-science attributed to Aristotle by an Egyptian poet. The perfect example of Alexander’s complicated afterlife._ 
Ferdowsi’s version is representative of the material that later Islamic sources on Alexander tended to use. For example influential early Islamic historian [Al Tabari](https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Tabari), for example, is clearly using a Persian source because he repeats the Persian parentage story, showing Alexander as the son of an emperor Darab. Naturally enough the “Roman” identification of Alexander follows along with the other material. At least until the time of the Crusades, when “Frank” became the generic word for European, Arabic readers would not have found anything unusual with Alexander coming from Rūm — even today, Greek communities in the Middle East are [Rūm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum_(endonym)) روم.

Combining Alexander’s popularity as, variously, a great conqueror, a symbol of Persian (!) power, and the student of a famous philosopher with the respect accorded to Dhu al-Qarnayn as a Quranic figure, Alexander’s reputation continued to grow in Islamic tradition. He became identified as a champion of monotheism and a kind of symbol of righteous kingship. The Persian poet [Nezāmi,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizami_Ganjavi) about a century after Ferdowsi, wrote a version that started off a bit closer to the historical sources but then [sends Alexander as far as China and Russia (with a side trip to Mecca)](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama-of-nezami). In a followup book, Nezami turns Alexander into a seeker of truth who debates with Socrates, Aristotle, Apollonius of Tyana , Porphyry, Plato and Hermes Trismegistus (a collection of philosophers scattered across six centuries of real time) and then decides to convert the world to monotheism.

This is only one example of Alexander’s long and fantastically varied afterlife — he was the focus of a multiverse long before Marvel.

Here’s a great video introduction to the complex afterlife of Alexander in the Islamic world:
