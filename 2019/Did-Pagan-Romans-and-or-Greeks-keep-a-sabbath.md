No. [Greeks and Romans didn’t adopt the seven-day week until pretty late](https://www.quora.com/Who-invented-the-seven-day-week-we-all-use-today/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=367359ae&srid=zLvM), for one thing. They did have a welter of different of religious observances but they were scheduled in a variety of ways, often causing a lot of confusion.

Some rites or festivals were tied to astronomical events like a solstice.

Some were tied to various lunar calendars (‘the third day after the Kalends of March’ or ‘the fifth of Anthesterion’). The problem was that until Julius Caesar’s calendrical reforms, those lunar calendars were pretty wonky — a feast that started off as a spring celebration could wander around by 30–60 solar days before someone came along and reset the calendar to line up with the seasons again.

Some were on longer cycles, like the four-year cycle of the Olympic games which was a religious festival as well as a sporting event. The sloppiness of the calendars often created confusion here too.

Some were situational — after something bad happened, like a military defeat or an earthquake, religious observance would be decreed to propitiate the gods. Conversely, a victory or some other positive event could lead to a celebration.

Other observances were gated on natural phenomena — local traditions might decree some kind of ritual had to be performed when, say, an eagle alighted on the roof of a temple or when a deformed foal was birthed by a mare.

Most Greek cities and the Roman state maintained a group of officials to try to manage this confusion. Before calendars were common for commercial purposes they were a way of informing the public of which days were set aside for religious purposes.

All of the scheduling issues were part of the complex ritual requirements for many types of public business — certain kinds of days were regarded as either lucky or unlucky, and the government didn’t want business transacted on the unlucky days. For example, a Roman law could not be voted on until the augurs (the priests responsible for seeing the future in the flights of birds or the entrails of sacrificed animals) saw favorable omens. These kinds of rituals were notoriously open to political abuse, since an augur could effectively block legislation for a long time by claiming that the omens were negative.

Romans, in particular, were anti-Sabbatarian: they regarded Jews as ‘lazy’ for devoting one day in every seven to rest. This became a standard trope of Roman anti-semitism, usually embroidered with stories about Jews devoting the day to drunken idling.
