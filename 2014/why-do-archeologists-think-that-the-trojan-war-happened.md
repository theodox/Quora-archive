It's usually believed that the "Trojan War" can be dated to 12th or 13th century BC, though there is a minority opinion that the entire thing is a literary fiction. The general feeling is that Troy is the city uncovered by German archaeologist [Heinrich Schliemann](http://cerhas.uc.edu/troy/q415.html) in 1871.

Strictly speaking we don't _know_  that the Trojan war happened, since there is only circumstantial evidence linking Heinrich Schleimann's discoveries at Hisarlik, Turkey with the Troy of Homer. No "Welcome to Troy" signs or pieces of the Trojan Horse, for example.

That said, the correspondence between clues in the Homeric texts, ancient traditions about the location of the city, and the kinds of material culture found at Troy / Hisarlik all make it the easiest guess. As far as we can tell the site was known to Hittites as "Wilusa", which matches up pretty well with Homer's 'Ilios", and we know from Hittite documents that "Wilusa" was involved regional conflicts that also featured the"Ahhiwaya", who sound like Homer's "Achaeans." and that it had at least one ruler named "Alaksandu", which sounds like the Homeric "Alexandros" - one of Paris' nicknames. So the balance of the evidence suggests some kind of connection, but we don't know the details and how they match up with Homer.

_the inscription on this disk, found at "Troy VI", is marked 'Wilusa', the Hittite word we think is Homer's 'Ilios'_ 

We do know that the city at Hisarlik was destroyed around 1200BC. Whether that is the Trojan War or not is tougher to say, many urban centers in the Easteren Mediterranean were destroyed around this time in a poorly understood series of events attributed [to a shadowy group of raiders or invaders known as the 'Sea Peoples'](https://www.quora.com/Where-did-the-Sea-Peoples-the-people-who-invaded-Greece-Egypt-and-the-Hittite-Empire-in-the-Late-Bronze-Age-come-from/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=4354e5a4&srid=zLvM), which may include the Greeks - but exactly what happened and how the events in western Turkey correlate with other events in the Levant, Mesopotamia, Egypt and Europe is hotly debated.

The Homeric poems do include several detail touches - the use of chariots, for example, and some details of armor and weapons, as well as place names - that all seem to point at roughly the same period. Many of the cities which appear in the poems as military powers — particularly Mycenae and Pylos — were insignificant hamlets in later eras, but appear as very prosperous centers in the archaeology off Bronze Age Greece. Even the [names of Homeric characters recur frequently in our scanty collection of Bronze Age writings](https://www.quora.com/Was-Achilles-a-real-character-If-so-how-do-we-know-he-actually-existed/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=7e04d838&srid=zLvM), though they’re not attached to the actual individuals in the poems.. Certainly "Homer" knew a lot of things that Classical era Greeks had long forgotten, which suggests the poems contain some core of historical truth.



As for "Why the war happened" — which is a different way to read the question — that's mostly a matter for guesswork. Apart from the traditional story of elopement and/or rape, it is often noted that Troy is well placed to control coastal trade from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. Troy was near a bunch of prosperous parts of western Asia minor (the famous Croesus, as in 'Wealthy as Croesus', was a Lydian from the same general area and spoke a language that we think was related to the language at Wilusa). So, it was a tempting target for a bunch of adventurers. And in those days, when every small-time Achaean king was more like what we'd call a "pirate" or a "gang lord" it didn't take much to start a war.
