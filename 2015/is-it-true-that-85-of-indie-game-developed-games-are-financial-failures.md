If anything I'd say that's optimisic, my usual (made up, instinctive) response is more like 90%. 

Of course there are ways you could define your terms to move that number around: Does a game which is abandoned after it's obviously in trouble count? What about games which make a meager profit --but not enough to bankroll a new project? Do you count the hordes of me-too freebie clones of Flappy Bird? etc, etc.

Since there's not one authoritative set of stats you can play numbers games... but the important takeaway is that most games of all stripes don't turn large profits. The successes are big enough that they usually pay for a few failures. Which is great unless your particular company has only failures.

I always recommend would-be devs to read Dan Cook's [Minimum Sustainable Success](http://www.lostgarden.com/2015/04/minimum-sustainable-success.html) before starting a studio. Her's on of his graphics, shamelessly borrowed:
