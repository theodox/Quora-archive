As other answers point out, there wasn't a single slogan or word that went with Roman battles (no "England, Harry, and St. George!" or "[Montjoie Saint Denis!").](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montjoie_Saint_Denis)

However, like almost all armies of the melee era, Roman armies did make a lot of noise, to raise their morale and intimidate the enemies. The Late Roman military writer [Vegetius ](http://www.digitalattic.org/home/war/vegetius/)offers this advice:

> The war-cry, which they call __barritus__ , should not be raised until both lines have engaged each other. It is a mark of inexperienced or cowardly men if they cry out from a distance. The enemy is more terrified if the shock of the war-cry is made to coincide with the blows of weapons.

The origin of the word '_barritus_ ' is debated: Ammianus calls it a 'barbarian' name, but other authorities derive if from _barrus_ , a Sabine word for "elephant" -- which would make it almost certainly a relic of Hannibal's career in Italy.

According to the [Strategikon, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategikon_of_Maurice) East Roman armies used '_Deus Nobiscum' ("God with us")._  This is a bit unusual for showing the persistence of Latin in the Greek-speaking armies of the east. It's obviously much later than the classical period.

On the other hand the Romans loved pre-battle _speeches._  Roman generals were positively addicted to addresses on the eve of battle -- they form a significant fraction of books like Livy.. Here's Caesar (writing about himself in the third person) about to cross the Rubicon:

> 1.7]These things being made known to Caesar, he harangued his soldiers; he reminded them "of the wrongs done to him at all times by his enemies, and complained that Pompey had been alienated from him and led astray by them through envy and a malicious opposition to his glory, though he had always favored and promoted Pompey's honor and dignity. He complained that an innovation had been introduced into the republic, that the intercession of the tribunes, which had been restored a few years before by Sulla, was branded as a crime, and suppressed by force of arms; that Sulla, who had stripped the tribunes of every other power, had, nevertheless, left the privilege of intercession unrestrained; that Pompey, who pretended to restore what they had lost, had taken away the privileges which they formerly had; that whenever the senate decreed, 'that the magistrates should take care that the republic sustained no injury' (by which words and decree the Roman people were obliged to repair to arms), it was only when pernicious laws were proposed; when the tribunes attempted violent measures; when the people seceded, and possessed themselves of the temples and eminences of the city; (and these instances of former times, he showed them were expiated by the fate of Saturninus and the Gracchi): that nothing of this kind was attempted now, nor even thought of: that no law was promulgated, no intrigue with the people going forward, no secession made; he exhorted them to defend from the malice of his enemies the reputation and honor of that general under whose command they had for nine years most successfully supported the state; fought many successful battles, and subdued all Gaul and Germany." The soldiers of the thirteenth legion, which was present (for in the beginning of the disturbances he had called it out, his other legions not having yet arrived), all cry out that they are ready to defend their general, and the tribunes of the commons, from all injuries.

And that's the short version! Until the late first century AD all Roman generals were also practicing politicians, which might explain (if not excuse) the habit. I'll take elephant-bellows any time.
