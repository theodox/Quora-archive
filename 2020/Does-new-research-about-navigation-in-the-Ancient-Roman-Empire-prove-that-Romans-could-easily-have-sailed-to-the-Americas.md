As a practical matter you have to distinguish between sailing _to_  the Americas and returning _from_  the Americas. The ocean has its own opinions that have to be taken into account.

__The westward passage__ 

Roman era sailors (not Romans - Mauretanians) did make it to the Canary Islands, but they evidently never made is far as Cape Verde. Had they known about that landfall it would have been within the reach of their ordinary sailing techniques.

From Cape Verde, it would be possible for a Roman captain to make it to the Caribbean in four or five weeks. A modern sailboat can do it in two weeks at a speed of about 14 knots — but a Roman ship was more likely to be operating around 5. Columbus took 29 days, though he was a bit north of the shortest possible route. Roman ships in the Indian Ocean managed blue-water sails of about a thousand miles a week (with the help of the reliable and strong monsoon winds). Cape Verde is around 2500 miles from landfall in the Caribbean.

You’d have to plan such a voyage carefully. You don’t want a conventional galley with oars — those rowers might be handy when the wind drops but they have to be fed and watered. A larger Roman ship would be capable of carrying enough: Roman grain freighters were primarily sail-driven and were larger than Columbus’s ships. Roman shell-style construction might not however be very safe in a serious Atlantic storm.

Nonetheless, if you knew for sure there was a landfall on the other side, you could probably make it work. The longer Indian Ocean voyages went from Arabia directly to the tip of India: the trip from Muscat to the Roman trade port at Muziris (Kodungallur) is around 1500 miles. The 2500 mile westward shot across the Atlantic would be daunting and dangerous — but probably not _impossible_ .

The typical Roman era estimate for the size of the earth was fairly accurate; they were more realistic than Columbus about the distance to Asia for a westward voyage. However many — though far from all — Greco-Roman geographers hypothesized this existence of a continent across the Atlantic. This was based primarily on a preference for symmetry — idea that half the globe was just empty ocean simply _felt_  wrong, but nobody had evidence to the contrary. Nonetheless it’s possible to imagine a somewhat megalomaniacal Roman project to find the [hesperides](https://pantheon.org/articles/h/hesperides.html), the mythical paradise said to be far to the west.

__The eastward return__ 

The problem for the Roman captain who made it across the Atlantic, however, would be getting home again. The currents and winds combine to make the westward passage fairly straightforward. But simply reversing direction means both are against you.

Roman ships didn’t have sternpost rudders, and usually did not have lateen sails. This limited their upwind performance severely — trying to tack back and forth across the trade winds to return to Africa would be far harder on a Roman crew than for a Renaissance-era Spaniard or Portuguese. Lacking magnetic compasses and good charts they’d also have a much harder time keeping track of their actual position heading east.

Columbus had to sail well north of his westward track track on the return voyage:

It took him about a month to reach the Azores — but of course, he knew they were there and had fairly good charts. The Romans didn’t know of their existence. Without any prior experience of the winds and weather patterns on the eastward trip the chance of success would go way down. In later times when the trip was routine, transatlantic trade tended to north from North America to England rather than straight east (though of course, politics also played a part).

That kind of route planning required a higher standard of both seamanship and navigation than was typical for Roman sailors. Calculating longitude before precision timepieces became available was extremely difficult. Columbus only really knew how far west he had travelled on his _second_ trip, in 1494, because he used a predicted lunar eclipse to get an accurate fix — and to find out, once and for all, that he was nowhere near Asia. At least, though, Columbus had a magnetic compass and an astrolabe (he never really figured out how to use the latter, apparently). With serious uncertainty about longitude and only crude ways to identify north during the day, calculating a safe course back to Europe would be a tremendous, and quite likely fatal, gamble.

While the old stereotype of the Romans being entirely confined to daylight sails within sight of land has been modified by recent research (particularly on the Indian trade) there’s really nothing comparable in the Roman sailing lexicon. The [discovery of the monsoon-route across the Indian Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippalus) was a fortunate accident, though it was brilliantly exploited. But it relies on a fairly predictable weather pattern that’s visible to anybody who lives on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The pattern of currents and winds in the Atlantic was not obvious in the same way: Columbus relied on the [volta do mar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volta_do_mar), the “turn of the sea” which was discovered by Portuguese navigators in the fifteenth century. Without that prior knowledge he too would never have been able to make his way back.
