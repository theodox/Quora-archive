We don’t have direct evidence - but the indirect evidence for similar gear being used in battle is pretty strong.

This example isn’t from Emesa, but from a long way off:

This is a cavalry mask that was found at Kalkriese, Germany — the site of the infamous [battle of the Teutorburger Wald](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-ambush-that-changed-history-72636736/), where Germanic tribes overwhelmed three Roman legions in the year 9. It’s still possible that this was ceremonial or dress kit. However the Kalkreise site was a literal battlefield — in the three days of running battle that terminated in the slaughter of the legions, it’s likely that a piece of parade-ground frippery would have been discarded. The odds are that this was worn in the fighting.

Full-face helmets were fairly common ([this page has a good roundup](http://www.romancoins.info/MilitaryEquipment-Facemasks.html) of the various types) though they were never the dominant form. Most examples seem to be cavalry helmets: since a lot of artwork shows Roman cavalry holding their javelins overhanded (possibly to allow the choice of thrusting or throwing) it may be that Roman cavalrymen were more inclined to face protection than foot soldiers.

On the other hand it may also reflect the fact that Roman citizen cavalry, though never very numerous, tended to be drawn exclusively from the wealthy. The face masks — which are almost always lavishly decorated and often chased with silver — may have been an indulgence for upper-class officers rather than a practical necessity.
