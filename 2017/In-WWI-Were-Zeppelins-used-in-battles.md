Yes. There were two main uses.

__Naval scouting.__  This is the least famous but probably [the most common application for airships in the first world war](http://amzn.to/2lDCZmp). The endurance and range of the zeppelins — combined with the lack of allied air cover over most of the North Sea — made them extremely useful scouts for the German navy. About half of all the airship sortees in the war were actually naval flights.

The Royal Navy was sufficiently concerned that they launched [the first naval airstrike in history](http://www.historynet.com/world-war-i-cuxhaven-raid-britains-bold-strike-from-the-sea.htm) against the airship fields at Cuxhaven on Christmas Day, 1914, using seaplanes.

__Strategic bombing.__ Zeppelins had longer ranges, heavier payloads, and higher altitude ceilings than most contemporary bombers. This made them the first choice for bombing raids in a number of circumstances.

The first raids were launched against Belgium in the opening days of the war:

By 1915 the Germans were attacking the British isles on a fairly regular basis . It took a while for effective defenses to evolve; the first zeppelin shot down over England was’t until September of 1916. Night attacks made the zeppelins even harder to fight. The invention of the [incendiary machine gun bullet](https://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A912124) rendered the zeppelins far more vulnerable, however, and the Germans began to concentrate their efforts on large multi-engine bomber planes like the [Gothas and Staakens](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/0/25235364).

In addition to anti-aircraft guns, air-raid monitors and night-fighters the British retaliated with a coordinated series of attacks on zeppelin maintenance facilities. History’s first aircraft carrier attack was aimed at the zeppelin sheds of [Tondern.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tondern_raid)

The zeppelin campaign, while it lasted, dropped almost 6000 bombs, killing 557 people and causing £1,500,000 (about $115,000,000 today) in damages

Zeppelins also served on the eastern front — their long range made them useful, but the lack of good targets and the difficulty of navigation kept them from being a major factor in the fighting. A zeppelin raid was tried against the Suez canal, but like many others it was defeated by weather. A raid on Malta failed when the attacking ship was destroyed in an accident. One zeppelin actually tried to bring supplies to isolated German troops in east Africa, but it was recalled after a journey of 4000 miles.



> The night-wind is humming,
My engines are thrumming,
Swift as a spark
Through the night and the dark
I am silently speeding;
Hovering grim and gray
Over my human prey,
Sowing the seeds of dearth
Over the stricken earth,
Where nations lie bleeding.

> Ship without sails am I,
Bird without wings am I,
Lord of the gales am I,
Terror of Kings am I,–
I am the Zeppelin!

> The cities are sleeping,
Their searchlights are sweeping,
Into the skies
I advance, I arise,
Where the distance grows vaster;
See where the sky grows red,
Lit by the bombs I shed–
Stealthy and swift,
I fling them my gift,
Death and disaster!

> Mark well the flight of me,
Ships! Have a care of me!
Shrink at the sight of me!
Cities! Beware of me!
I am the Zeppelin!
