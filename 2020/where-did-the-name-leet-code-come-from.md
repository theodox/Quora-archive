In the dark times, [in the days of the .plan wars](http://dk.toastednet.org/dotPlan/romeroplan_1997.htm) —before discord and voice chat, the ancient used a grim and terrible lore to communicate across vast distances. They would type (!) to each other in Doom or Quake, since our enlightened modern ways of spewing racism homophobia and bad sportsmanship were but the merest twinkle in PewDePie’s toddler eye.

As the heroes of old called each other horrible names in those misty ancient days, they discovered to their horror that mad skills —yea, even mastery of the dreaded BFG (and verily, the f means what thou thinkest) did not confer the ability to type correctly. Many a triumphant slur or accusation of cheating was rendered laughable by ridiculous spellings and general illiteracy.

But — as their degenerate offspring, the txtrs know well, sometimes a curse can be a badge of honor. Why be a mere “haker” or “cheet” when you can proudly wear the mantle of a [haxor](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/haxor)? And so was born the ancient tongue known as [Leet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet). Because — mere mortal — they were _elite_ . So elite, in fact, that mere alphabetical characters could not express their elitism — the correct spelling (now lost in this soft and decadent age) is 1337!!!! And woe unto him who uses less than four !!!!’s

There. Now you have been [pwned](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pwned).
