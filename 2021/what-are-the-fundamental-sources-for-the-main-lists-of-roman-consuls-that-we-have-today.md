The republican era list is largely based on the [Fasti Capitolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasti_Capitolini)

_A fragment of the fasti, from the Capitoline Museum in Rome. This section records the middle of the 120’s BC — the first legible entry is_ _[Gaius Sextius Calvinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Sextius_Calvinus)_ _, one of the consuls of 124, down near the bottom is_ _[Quintus Marcius Rex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Marcius_Rex_(consul_118_BC))_ _of 118.

Since the Romans [didn’t use serial calendar dating](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/varronian-chronology/) — everything was dated according to the names of the consuls for a given year — the Roman state maintained a public list of the consuls that could be used for reference.

The list also served the important secondary purpose of reminding people of the political prominence of different Roman clans. There were many copies in antiquity but our primary version was recorded in stone during the age of Augustus. The first pieces were rediscovered in 1546, when the Popes were mining the Forum for marble to use in the building of St. Peters. The architect [Pirro Ligorio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirro_Ligorio) noticed the inscribed fragments embedded in a wall being dismantled (they had already been reused once before) and saved what he could from the demolition. Ligorio and the scholarly monk [Onofrio Panvinio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onofrio_Panvinio) coordinated the rescue of many pieces. Panvinio went on to publish the first comprehensive list in 1557. The archaeological data was not complete — but by coordinating it with literary evidence (particularly [Livy) ](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/livy/livy-5/)and it was possible to sequence and restore a large portion of the list.

_“The [Roman] Fasti and Triumphs, from king Romulus up to Charles V, Caesar Augustus” Panivinio’s edition of the fasti from 1557 (from_ _[Google Books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Fasti_et_Triumphi_Rom_a_Romulo_rege_usqu/kmMNon1nRr4C?q=&gbpv=0#f=false)_ _)_ 

New finds continued to expand the list into the early 19th century. Today the restored fasti are kept in the Sala da Lupa in the Capitoline museum. We believe there are four names unaccounted for in the republican lists, though modern scholars believe the earliest century or two of the records are not very reliable.

The records for the imperial era are not as good. Most of these are pieced together from variety of fragmentary sources, often sources from the later Roman empire. For example the [Chronograph of 354](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronograph_of_354) provides a pretty complete but very laconic list down to that year. Late-antique and later Carolingian copyists who preserved this information did a remarkable job of preserving information whose relevance to their ordinary lives was minimal. But, of course, copying out long lists of meaningless names is also a process prone to mis-spellings, transpositions and other errors which are much harder to catch than errors in a literary text. Thus, the lists frequently need to be verified against other evidence.

The division of the empire under Diocletian and the rapid decay of institutions in the west after 400 makes the study of the last centuries of the consulate more complex. The major modern study on later consuls is [Consuls of the Later Roman Empire ](https://www.amazon.com/Consuls-Society-Classical-Philological-Monographs/dp/155540099X), a massive work whose bulk is necessitated by the amount of work needed to assemble a convincing list from a diverse array of sources of varying quality.

Consular dating stop altogether in 541.
