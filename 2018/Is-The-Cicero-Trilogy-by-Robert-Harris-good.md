I find it pretty good.

The last decades of the republic are very well-trodden ground. Both because of the intrinsic interest of the subject and the accidents of transmission that give us so many rich sources, the twenty years from 64 to 44 BC are the best known decades in western antiquity.

That makes them a bit treacherous for historical novelists: it’s hard to stand out in a crowded field. Among the other authors who’ve covered this era are [Colleen McCullough](http://amzn.to/2Fqpjoq), [Steven Saylor](http://amzn.to/2todAp2), [John Maddox Roberts](http://amzn.to/2FyzNFH), [Taylor Caldwell](http://amzn.to/2Fzlron), [Thornton Wilder ](http://amzn.to/2oZT7ST)(of _Our Town_ and _Skin of our Teeth)_ and even [Shakespeare](http://amzn.to/2Fqqy74).

From a historical standpoint, Harris’s books are solidly researched. They are fiction, not history, so they have to tell a clear story without the hedging and equivocations historians love. Still, the books don’t do violence to the subject matter.

As novels, they work well. Cicero is a great character to base a novel on — a tremendous but also tremendously flawed human being who can be principled or venal, cowardly or heroic, moodily self-aware and completely blind to his own faults by turns. I particularly appreciate the degree to which Harris manages to inject some life into Cicero’s great weapon, his courtroom speeches. Generations of schoolkids have labored over these orations — C. S. Lewis famously called Cicero one of “the great bores” — trying in vain to understand how they became the stuff of history. Harris provides enough context — and enough judicious editing — to help the reader feel how a bookish, unwarlike man who wasn’t even rich became a serious opponent to the likes of Caesar and Pompey on the strength of words alone. I should add that the reader for the audio book series does a good job of selling this as well.

My primary critique would be that the narrator — Cicero’s secretary [Tiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Tullius_Tiro) — does not evolve into very much of a character in his own right. He is a useful authorial stand-in, and his explanations are a useful tool for providing context to the reader, but the doesn’t show much of a personality or point of view of his own.

Overall: definitely recommended both for Roman history fans and for general readers who want to get a first hand look at a very dramatic — and amazingly well realized — period in history.
