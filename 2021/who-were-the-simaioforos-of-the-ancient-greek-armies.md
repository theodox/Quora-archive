it’s literally “flag bearers”, which could also mean “signalmen”: [σημειοφόρος ](https://lsj.gr/wiki/%CF%83%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%86%CF%8C%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82)is the same root as the English “semaphore.” If a Greek source is talking about a Roman army, it might mean specifically the legionary [aquilifer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquilifer); you’d need to look at the context to be sure.
