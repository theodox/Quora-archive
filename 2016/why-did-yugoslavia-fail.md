To add to what the other answers have already pointed out, I’ll simply repeat a conversation I had on a train with a couple of tipsy Yugsolav reservists going home for New Year’s eve of 1986–7. We discussed the fact that, despite the Red Stars plastered all over the place their main worry was the Soviets and not the west.

“What will you do if the Russians come?” I asked.

“We fight!”

and the second reservist said,

“Ah… but what if they _don’t_  come?”

They shook their heads an exchanged a look I didn’t understand until some years later, when I turned on the TV and saw the train station (in Zagreb) under air attack.
