It kind of depends on your definition of _democratic._ 

Theoretically, at least, the sovereign power was the the people (the _populus,_  the free male citizens -- also the P in SPQR). As such only the populus could enact actual _laws._ Unlike all modern democracies Rome did not have a legislature: the only way to get a new law passed was through one of the citizen assemblies in which citizens themselves voted directly on laws. So in that sense at least Rome was notably _more_  democratic than any modern state.

However in some other senses Rome was much less democratic because the system was design to ensure that some citizen's votes counted more than others. 

There were two different voting assemblies: 

The [Centuriate Assembly ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centuriate_Assembly) was organized by wealth. with different property classes voting as blocs. Each individual had only one vote but voting was winner-take-all within each property class. The smaller, wealthier classes therefore dominated the voting even though they contained fewer people. This assembly elected the highest magistrates: the consuls and the praetors.

The [Tribal Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_Assembly) was organized by location, so it was less obviously biased in favor of the wealthy. It elected the junior magistracies (aediles and quaestors) and the tribunes. 

Both assemblies could pass laws, but many complex political and technical considerations could influence the choice of venue for a proposal. One very important limitation on the democratic aspect of the Roman system was that citizens could not propose laws - they could only vote on measures which a senior magistrate had proposed: this was quite different from ancient Athens where any citizen could propose a law and the magistrates only provided minimal procedural guidance to the process.

Another important limit on Roman democracy was the fact that Senate membership was for life. The Senate could not pass laws but it did issue directives and day-to-day guidance to the current magistrates; in this regard it was similar to a modern civil service, which lives on despite the coming and goings of particular politicians and of popular moods. 

One last limitation on the democratic nature of the system was its inherent complexity. The system abounded in checks and balances: the tribunes of the people (elected by the more democratic tribal assembly could veto any proposed law or government action -- but on the other hand the college of augurs, dominated by aristocrats and nominated by the Senate, could do effectively the same thing by claiming unfavorable omens. And of course there were two chief executive officers so that no one person was actually in charge -- a defense against tyranny but also often an obstacle to efficient governance. The drag factor of the Roman constitution made it less responsive to the popular will (something that many ancient political writers regarded as its key advantage over the [much more erratic Athenian version.](https://www.quora.com/Did-Athenian-democracy-fail-because-of-its-democratic-nature)
