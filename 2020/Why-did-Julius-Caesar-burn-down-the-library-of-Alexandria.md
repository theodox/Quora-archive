The library was just collateral damage in a messy urban fight.

The political situation in Egypt was a tremendous mess. Caesar only came to Egypt in pursuit of Pompey — after Caesar defeated the Senatorial forces at [Pharsalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pharsalus), Pompey took ship for Egypt hoping he’d be able to raise money and new troops from his many friends in the eastern provinces. However Egypt’s own politics were in turmoil, and the Egyptians who met Pompey assassinated him, hoping to gain Caesar’s support in their own civil war. Caesar, however, was aghast* to see a Roman proconsul and his former brother-in-law beheaded by a bunch of slippery Greeks.

He tried to force a settlement on the Egyptians because he was still in the middle of fighting his own civil war against the remainder of the Senatorial forces in Spain and North Africa. He gave the best prize to Cleopatra — not to her brother, [Ptolemy XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XIII_Theos_Philopator), whose advisors had been behind Pompey’s murder.

Fighting broke out between Caesar’s forces and Ptolemy’s supporters, and Caesar was basically besieged in the waterfront districts of Alexandria. The battle lines were drawn right through the heart of the city, with the opposing forces demolishing buildings and fortifying neighborhoods, bombarding each other with artillery at close range (the Romans didn’t think much of the Egyptians as fighters, but they were very impressed by the technical sophistication of their engineers).

The Romans were backed up against the water, headquartered in the “Brucheion” or “royal quarter” where the palaces and the Library were located (on the map above, their position probably about where the word ‘Brucheion’ is placed. The Romans controlled the great harbor (to the east) and the Egyptians the Eunostos harbor to the west. There was intense fighting for control of the heptastadion, the causeway linking the Pharos island to the mainland — it had openings which allowed both sides to raid each other’s shipyards until Caesar blocked them to protect his shipping.

The fighting was messy and intense on both land and sea: Here’s [Cassius Dio’s version](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/42*.html):

> … many battles occurred between the two forces both by day and by night, and many places were set on fire, with the result that the docks and the storehouses of grain among other buildings were burned, and also the library, whose volumes, it is said, were of the greatest number and excellence. [Egyptian commander] Achillas was in possession of the mainland, with the exception of what Caesar had walled off, and the latter of the sea except the harbour. Caesar, indeed, was victorious in a sea-fight, and when the Egyptians, consequently, fearing that he would sail into their harbour, had blocked up the entrance with the exception of a narrow passage, he cut off that outlet also by sinking freight ships loaded with stones; so they were unable to stir, no matter how much they might desire to sail out. After this achievement provisions, and water in particular, were brought in more easily; for Achillas had deprived them of the local water-supply by cutting the pipes.

The actual details of the fire aren’t well recorded. The most vivid account of the burning is poetic, rather than historical: [Lucan’s epic poem about the civil war](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0134%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D434#note-link2) describes the fire that accompanied the fighting on the waterfront like this:

> There, too, was Caesar's all-protecting arm;
For these at point of sword, and those with fire
He forces back, and though besieged he dares
To storm th' assailants: and as lay the ships
Joined rank to rank, bids drop upon their sides
Lamps drenched with reeking tar. Nor slow the fire
To seize the hempen cables and the decks
Oozing with melting pitch; the oarsman's bench
All in one moment, and the topmost yards
Burst into flame: half merged the vessels lay
While swam the foemen, all in arms, the wave;
Nor fell the blaze upon the ships alone,
But seized with writhing tongues the neighbouring homes,
And fanned to fury by the Southern breeze
Tempestuous, it leaped from roof to roof;
Not otherwise than on its heavenly track,
Unfed by matter, glides the ball of light,
By air alone aflame

Both sides used fire in the sea fights. The Egyptians had tried sending fire ships under the bridges connecting the mainland and the Pharos island, hoping to set the Roman transports alight in the great harbor. Lucan’s description suggests that the Romans returned the favor by dropping fire from their own positions onto tightly packed Egytpian ships during the fighting between the harbors. The combination of wind and densely-packed naval supplies let the blaze get out of hand. This jibes with Dio’s assertion that the docks and the grain stores (which would have been in the waterfront) were also destroyed.

One reason we don’t know much about the details is that Caesar’s friends were reluctant to dwell on the destruction. Caesar’s official account of the fighting includes a rather puzzling passage claiming that Alexandria was basically fireproof — though it then goes on to discuss both fires and the fact that Egyptians built an entire fleet by taking wooden roofs and beams from buildings in the city. While the destruction of the library wasn’t an intentional act of vandalism, it’s evident that it was profoundly embarrassing and not much talked about for a good long while after the event
