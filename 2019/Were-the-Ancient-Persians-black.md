Let’s look at [this 2500 year old inscription from Darius I:](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/achaemenid-royal-inscriptions/dna/)

> I am Darius the great king, king of kings, king of countries containing all kinds of men, king in this great earth far and wide, son of Hystaspes, an Achaemenid, __a Persian, son of a Persian,__  __an Aryan, having Aryan lineage.__ 

The contemporary name of Iran (that is, Persia) is actually derived from the same root. So, it’s a tough case to make: if even the Aryans are black, who _isn’t?_ 

OK, that’s a _bit_  unfair.

In Persian and related languages, “Aryan” was roughly a synonym for “noble” or “best” — it’s from the the same ancient root _aristos_ in Greek_,_ from which we get “aristocrat.” Ancient Persians used it to differentiate speakers of Iranian or Vedic languages from people who spoke other languages, and also as a marker of high status. For Darius, it’s a boast about his high birth, not about his melanin quota; when he says “I’m an Aryan” he’s saying “I’m a part of the elite of the Iranian-speaking world.”

The “racial” connotation shows up millennia later, thanks to the unfortunate influence of [Arthur de Gobineau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_de_Gobineau) in the 1800’s. Gobineau, a reactionary defender of aristocracy — noted the fact that the root of “Aryan” is the word for “noble” or “excellent” and decided that Aryans were a racial grouping of “superior” peoples. This idea took a detour through [bizarre Nazi theories about Atlantis](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/444076/The-Nazis-search-for-Atlantis-and-the-Holy-Grail) and eventually you get the modern idea that “Aryan” and “bottle blond” were equivalent.

Nevertheless, even the Nazi’s didn’t forget who the original Aryans were: they[ awarded “Aryan” status in their own sense to 20th century Iranians.](https://www.quora.com/What-did-Hitler-think-about-Iranians-Persians/answer/Pasha-Damirchi?ch=10&share=4af2c25f&srid=zLvM) When you find yourself being _less inclusive than Hitler,_  that’s probably a good sign you’re pursuing a bad theory.

Leaving aside bad racial theories from the past, there’s a very interesting laboratory experiment you can use to address this question. The [Parsee community in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsis), which was formed by refugees from Persia fleeing the Islamic conquest after the 8th century, is kind of a time capsule letting us see what the genetic makeup of Persia looked like a thousand years ago. The Parsees practice _very_  strict endogamy — that is, they don’t marry outside their own community. It turns out that, even though they’ve been living in India for more than a thousand years, they are actually [genetically closer to the Neolithic population of Persia than many modern Iranians](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1244-9), having less admixture from the west and south. But there’s clear continuity between modern Iranians, the bottled-in-time Parsee community, and the evidence for the pre-historic populations of the Iranian plateau, particularly in the north and east.

And no, they don’t look very closely related to Africans.

If you want the usual string of pictures that accompany these kinds of questions, it’s hard to find contemporary depictions of Persians that would satisfy. There’s a lot of uncolored statuary from the Achaemenid Era (550–330 BC) but not much colored stuff until the Parthian period a couple of hundred years after Alexander the Great’s conquest.

The famous faience tiles from Persepolis might satisfy a fan of the “Black Persian” hypothesis:

_[This picture from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/arts/persian-collections-louvre-susa.html)_ _shows a modern audience with a frieze of Persian archers from the imperial palace at Persepolis, now in the Louvre Museum._ 

Some scholars think these archers are Elamites, rather than Persians (the Elamites are a distinct group in antiquity, centered along what’s now the southern part of the Iran-Iraq border). In any event, this piece certainly doesn’t look like fair-skinned people — whether that’s ‘black’ in your eyes is up to you.

On the other hand, the archers are a bit of an anomaly. The same archaeological site provides a good example of how Persian artists saw the difference between themselves and Africans. Here’s a court official (at right) leading a delegation bringing tribute to the Persian empire from the kingdom of Kush, in what’s now Sudan, on the southern border of Persian-controlled Egypt. The difference in height is probably exaggerated, but the artist certainly trying to portray these folks as quite distinct (his effort at depicting the giraffe, at left, is… interesting…).

Later Persian art, from the Parthian and Sassanian eras, is much less ambiguous. Here’s a Parthian-era Persian, from what’s now Uzbekistan:

And a Sassanian-era mosaic from the royal palace in Bishapur:

And textiles from the Sassanian period portray Persians like this:

And, for contrast’s sake here’s how an Egyptian artist depicted the [war between the Persians and the Ethiopian empire of Axum in the 570’s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksumite%E2%80%93Persian_wars)

In short, it’s not impossible to understand why somebody whose only association with this subject was Google Image Search might get the wrong idea.

But it’s still the wrong idea.
