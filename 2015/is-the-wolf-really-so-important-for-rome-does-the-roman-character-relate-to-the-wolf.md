The [Lupa capitolina](http://en.museicapitolini.org/collezioni/percorsi_per_sale/appartamento_dei_conservatori/sala_della_lupa/lupa_capitolina) is a great metaphor for the role of the wolf in Roman mythology:

If you look carefully you'll see a big mismatch in style between the babies underneath (intended for Romulus and Remus, as other answers note) and the wolf. The babies were added in the Renaissance by antiquarians who _assumed_  that the wolf was the one in the founding myth, the same one referenced by numerous ancient authors as having a prominent place in the forum [(the wiki page has a list of citations)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitoline_Wolf). 

The wolf is actually Etruscan in style, not Roman, and the traditional dating would have made it slightly older than the Repblic: the style is assigned to ~600 BC but the traditional date for the first consulship is 509 BC. It could be that one of the Etruscan kings of Rome put it up; it could be spoils of a war between Etruscan Rome and some other part of Italy (some art historians think the style reflects Greek settlers in Italy not Etruscans); or it could be indigenous. A minority view is that it's a late forgery.

The same is basically true for the myth itself: it belongs to the messy tangle of local beliefs that predate Roman recorded history and it has many possible, debatable origins. Some think it's a tribal totem story -- the same sort of thing you see in Amerindian cultures where a people is said to be descended from a mythical ancestor. Other Italic peoples seem to have those: [Mirko Grewing](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mirko-Grewing) has examples. Others think the story was a Greek reworking of a local Italic tradition or myth, adding traditional Greek folkloric elements like fighting brothers and abandoned infants that was done to 'rationalize' -- or at least familiarize -- a 'barbarian' story for a Greek audience. Some think it's a mythologized account of how a group of pastoralists (Romulus and Remus grew up to be shepherd, and shepherds are the humans who interact with wolves most regularly) conquered a settled people and became their overlords : a miniature version of the Yuan dynasty in myth. As you can see from the length of that list, there's no single easy answer.

We do know that in historic times the myth was repeatedly re-told and re-interpreted so it did form a critical part of the Roman self image. Sometimes it was to give a divine or miraculous sanction to the Roman state and people; sometimes it was to incorporate Romans into the Greek world-view (in many versions, the children's real father is Herakles); and sometimes to explain how Rome achieved its dominant position in the world. 

In general, because of the nature of our sources, we only know how a tiny slice of Romans felt or thought about anything: the Cicero's and Livy's of the world or their Greek-speaking counterparts reflect the opinions of an educated elite that was usually pretty jaded about the 'truth' of their own myths. As for what the 'average' Roman really thought , we're pretty much guessing, but I suspect that it was a much more 'magical', and certainly one with a closer tie to the complex, tangled mythological roots of the Roman world than the one we read about.

No matter how you look at it, though, this was a very important story in Roman minds.

This coin is from Constantine, the emperor who legalized Christianity. Even he could find no better way to symbolize his [New Rome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Rome).

Here's a [page of Romulus and Remus on Roman coins](https://www.forumancientcoins.com/moonmoth/reverse_romulus.html), which illustrates how long the story stayed relevant to people (although I think the author is jamming in references to the [Dioscuri](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/164426/Dioscuri), who were sort of the anti-Romulus-and-Remus since they were _good_  brothers).
