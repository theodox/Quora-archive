This seems like it’s connected to something coming out of a non-scholarly source, a book called the “Sistine Secrets” which purports to show the Dan-Brown-style secrets-in-plain-site “truth” about the Vatican. It looks like it also gets recycled into claims that the Vatican is actually built around a Shiva temple. I don’t think either the Etruscan or the Shaivite claims hold up very well.

I’ve never seen _Vatika_  in an Etruscan word-list or dictionary. The closet match would be _[Vanth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanth)_ _,_ a well attested female figure connected to the underworld.

The ending -_ika_ is suspicious. I can’t claim to “know” Etruscan (hardly anyone can, there’s not much material and we don’t even have a scholarly consensus on what languages, if any, it may be related to) but we are pretty sure Etruscan is not an Indo-European.

That _-ika_  ending does sound very Indo-European, though — one reason people on the Vatican-as-Shiva-Linga side of things have no problem coming up with place names in India that sound like _Vatika_ for their theory. Plenty of Sanskrit or Hindi adjectives will have cognates in Latin: I don’t know if [this list](http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?tran_input=vaTi&direct=se&script=hk&link=yes&mode=3) is exhaustive but it seems like a good illustration of the principle.

The Romans had two competing etymologies for _Vatican_ . The first came from _[vates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vates)_ _,_  a prophet or seer. The same word means the same thing in Gaullish, so it might be a loan word. A different etymology derives from it from an Etruscan settlement named _Vaticum_  or something similar. Unfortunately the total number of citations is pretty small ([this link includes all of them](https://books.google.com/books?id=SYqFBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA546&lpg=PA546&dq=vaticanus+ager&source=bl&ots=junGS5F_uI&sig=go0WTI4cTE1WI1mCmfs_eLflgG4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmpKKC9OzXAhUL82MKHauCB5Y4FBDoAQgrMAE#v=onepage&q=vaticanus%20ager&f=false), I believe) and ancient etymologies are often little more than guesswork.
