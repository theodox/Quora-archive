Somewhere on the [Beas River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beas_River) in the Punjab (which the Greeks called the Hyphasis.) That’s where Alexander’s army mutinied and demanded to return home.

Unfortunately we don’t have a great sense of where exactly the final stopping point really was. Most modern reconstructions have the line of march from the Indus heading southeast with the hills on the left flank — but that’s just guesswork for the most part.
