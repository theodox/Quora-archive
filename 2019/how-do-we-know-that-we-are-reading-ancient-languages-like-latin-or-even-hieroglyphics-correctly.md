# How do we know that we are reading ancient languages like Latin or even hieroglyphics correctly?

There are two very different scenarios.

Latin — at least, the Latin we actually read in, say, a college class — is a “dead language” in name only. There’s a continuous tradition of Latin literacy going back to the early republic, at least as far as around 200 BC — in the subsequent 2220 years there’s never been a time when there were not a large number of people literate in Latin who could pass on first-hand knowledge of the language. Many ancient languages (Greek, say, or Sanskrit) are in the same general category: they may not be the language of ordinary life anymore but they are not “lost” in any meaningful way. We have to use some degree of reconstruction to understand the sound changes that take place over time but the grammar and vocabulary of these kinds of languages are very solidly understood.

At the other end of the spectrum are languages whose literary tradition was interrupted. A perfect example is [Akkadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language#Decipherment), the language of the ancient Assyrian empire. It is no longer spoken and its [cuneiform ](https://www.ancient.eu/cuneiform/)writing system was abandoned for at least 1500 years.

In that kind of case, the work to get to a true understanding of the language is very significant. In the case of Akkadian we had two very lucky breaks: first, we found a version of a language we did know (Old Persian) recorded in cuneiform script. That helped to decipher the writing system. Second, Akkadian belongs to the Semitic language family. Although it has many differences from living Semitic languages like Hebrew or Arabic, the grammar and vocabulary of those languages made it much easier to decipher Akkadian language texts. It was still a herculean task, but it only took about a generation of scholarship to crack the basics of the language.

The decipherment of Akkadian illustrates how we know when we’ve got it right (or mostly right — there’s always room for argument about the details). In 1857 — only a decade after the first cuneiform signs were deciphered — the British Royal Asiatic Society sponsored a famous test, where four students of Akkadian were given the same text to translate. The four scholars ([Julius Oppert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Oppert), [Henry Fox Talbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Fox_Talbot), [Edward Hincks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hincks) and [Henry Rawlinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Henry_Rawlinson,_1st_Baronet)) all translated it individually and a jury of scholars examined their results. Two of the four translations were almost identical and the other two were substantially similar — this was proof that the language was actually being read, rather than simply guessed at. Over the subsequent 160 years we’ve translated vast reams of Akkadian, everything from laundry lists to poetry, and we’re very confident in our understanding of the language even though there are always places for scholars to argue about subtle nuances.

The hardest case — the one that is almost never cracked — is when we have a combination of an unknown script and an unknown language. Even a fiendishly difficult writing system, like Egyptian or Mayan hieroglyphs, can be deciphered when we have a living language to use as a guide. Both Egyptian and Mayan have living descendants. However without any kind of living connection it’s extremely difficult to make progress. The [Indus script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_script), for example, has defied decryption for almost 150 years. But those kinds of situations are hardly ambiguous — a language is usually either readable or not, the scholarly community is much too competitive to sit back and allow a dubious “translation” to stand without a lot of efforts to poke holes in it. There have been many failed translations down the years: Egyptian hieroglyphs, for example, [were mistranslated in a variety of amusing ways for more than a thousand years until they were finally cracked in the 19th century](https://www.quora.com/How-were-the-Hieroglyphics-deciphered/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=391c9e0f&srid=zLvM).

One of the very few isolated languages that has ever been resurrected is Sumerian, the language that cuneiform was created for. Sumerian has no known relatives of any kind — however those Akkadian scribes who borrowed the cuneiform writing system [thoughtfully provided us with extensive word lists and grammatical notes comparing their own language with Sumerian, which enabled us to bring Sumerian back from the dead. ](https://www.quora.com/How-did-historians-learn-Sumerian-How-was-such-an-old-dead-language-decoded/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=6f1c236c&srid=zLvM)Few really obscure ancient languages are that lucky, however.
