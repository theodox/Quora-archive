There’s really nothing much to go on. The primary historical sources are pretty good, by ancient standards. However, they are not strictly contemporary and are all more-or-less dependent on Roman point of view.

Polybius, the best surviving source, wrote two generations after Hannibal first set foot in Italy (Polybius finished his work at the end of the Third Punic War, in 146 BC; Hannibal’s invasion began in 218). Livy, the second-most-quoted source, wrote in the era of Augustus, so two centuries after the fact. Both of these historians — and later writers from the imperial era, like Appian, Dio Cassius and Plutarch — had access to eyewitness accounts that are now lost. In those days before the invention of the footnote it was common to paraphrase without citations, so we don’t really know where any individual fact originates except in the rare cases where an author makes a point of telling us.

We do know that pro-Carthaginian accounts circulated in Greek during the war and its immediate aftermath; Hannibal was aware of the value of public opinion in the Greek world, particularly [when he was reaching out to the Macedonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian%E2%80%93Carthaginian_Treaty) after Cannae. He even brought several Greek writers along on campaign — [Sosylus of Lacedaimon](http://www.attalus.org/translate/fgh.html#176.0) and [Philinus of Acragas](https://www.jstor.org/stable/637362?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) are the best known names — but we have only scraps and tatters of their work. If there were some “official” Carthaginian reason for the way events fell out, it’s likely that it would have been recorded there and it’s _likely_  that it would have attracted comment from the authors we do have — but that’s a plausible supposition rather than a fact.

The most famous account of Hannibal’s failure to invest the city is Livy’s. It’s quite vivid but it definitely represents Livy’s retrospective analysis more than a well-documented first hand view of Carthaginian counsels. It is not _impossible_  that this account is based on a line or two from Philinus or Sosylus — but it’s hardly guaranteed:

> 51.1. In his moment of victory Hannibal was surrounded by his staff, crowding round to congratulate him and urge him after such a massive success to spend the remainder of the day and the following night resting himself, and giving his exhausted soldiers time to recover. 51.2. But Maharbal, his cavalry commander would have none of it, urging him not to waste a moment. “I’ll tell you what this battle has really achieved,” he declared, “when in five days time you are feasting on the Capitol. Follow up quickly. I’ll go ahead with the cavalry, 51.3. and before they even realise we are coming, the Romans will discover we’ve arrived.”

> For Hannibal it all seemed far too optimistic, an almost inconceivable possibility. He commended Maharbal for his imaginative idea, but said he needed time to think it through. 51.4 Maharbal’s reply was short and to the point. “The gods do not give all their gifts to any one man. You can win a battle, Hannibal. But you have no idea how to exploit it.”

[Livy, book XXII](http://www.johndclare.net/AncientHistory/Hannibal_Sources6.html)

The easiest hypothesis (but of course, it is just a hypothesis) is that Hannibal did not really have a plan at all: he was overtaken by an unexpected success and decided to capitalize on the rapid defections of Rome’s subjects in Campania, Bruttium, and Lucania rather than attacking the city directly. After all, Hannibal did not really excel at siege warfare: tiny Nola held out against him on three separate occasions. The capture of Saguntum — much closer to his Iberian power base — took him eight months. So it’s possible that he simply didn’t think he actually could take the city by storm. Turning Rome’s allies would both secure his rear and enhance his own strength while diminishing Rome’s.

All that said, however, the real answer is unknowable given the sources we have.
