The reference is probably to abris or temporary rock shelters — it’s not really a depiction of “cavemen” but rather of semi-nomadic pastoralists in an increasingly arid region. An example is the formation at [Jebel Uweinat](https://africanrockart.britishmuseum.org/country/sudan/jebel-uweinat/), in the Sudan, which is an isolate rock formation that hosted people from at least 3000 B.C. until the beginning of our era ( we can tell this site was in use that late because it includes paintings of camels, which did not come to the region until the Roman period).

From comments in other Greek and Roman sources it appears like there was a band of dry savannah or semi desert stretching west across the southern edge of the Sahara, including places that today are mostly uninhabited. For example the site at [Uan Muhuggiag ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uan_Muhuggiag)in Libya also seems to have been put to similar use by pastoral people, though it was abandoned much earlier due to desertification. There were enough people living like this that the Greeks of Ptolemaic Egypt named the coast near the border between Egypt and Sudan “Troglodytica”— it’s said that Cleopatra learned their language.

It’s very unlikely that there really was just a single ethnic group stretching from Egypt to Morocco; its more likely that the Greeks and Romans lumped a lot of different peoples together under convenient label because they practiced similar pastoral lifestyles.

We know very little about these peoples, though they left [marvelous artwo](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/garamantes/rock-art/)rk in the places they used for shelter. It seems that the expansion of the desert and the end of the fossil water supplies finally put an end to this lifestyle around the fifth century of our era. The —[Garamantes](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/garamantes/) — the nation that Herodotus describes as hunting the Troglodytes— outlasted them by a couple of centuries but by that point the modern Sahara, of camel caravans and not much else, had completely erased the old pastoral zones where the Troglodytes lived.

It’s been suggested that there is a connection between “troglodyte” and “Tuareg”, though that’s just a conjecture. It’s perhaps less likely since other Greek writers use the same word for people using rock shelters in Asia Minor and the Crimea— it does have a plausible Greek etymology (“cave descenders”).
