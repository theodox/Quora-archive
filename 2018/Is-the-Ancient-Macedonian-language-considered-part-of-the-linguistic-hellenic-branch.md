It’s very poorly attested, so anything we say about it has to be treated with caution. It’s also, unfortunately, the focus of intense politicking in the contemporary world which does not always lend itself to scholarly nuance. Our sources, moreover, concern only a tiny slice of Macedonians.

It’s well known that Macedonian upper classes of the historic period definitely wanted themselves to be recognized as Greeks. They went as far as [suing for admission to the Olympic games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Macedon).* They used Greek personal names like _Alexandros, Phillipos_ and _Hephaistíon._ The royal family, at least,[ claimed to be an offshoot of the royal family of Argos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argead_dynasty). Whether that means _all_  Macedonians were Hellenes is not something we can be sure of — but for the attested material it’s clear that plenty of Macedonians spoke Greek, or something so similar to Greek that the distinction is academic.

The question is, what kind of Greek?

It’s not wise to take the stories that the Argeads liked to foster about their kinship to Argos (and, in other contexts, to the family of Achilles) at face value — but it may be significant that Macedonian proper names often include [Doric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doric_Greek)-sounding morphology with endings in _-as —_ well known names like _Amyntas_  or _Perdiccas_ would generally strike a Greek hearer as Doric. The longest original text found in Macedonia, the [Pella curse tablet,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pella_curse_tablet) is usually described as written in Doric as well. Nowadays the primary academic debate is whether Macedonian Greek is a subset of Doric, or if it is wiser to lump Macedonian and Doric together with the speech of Epirus and Locris into a broader “northwest Greek” grouping.

Some of the same forms and many of the same names are also common in the [Aeolic ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolic_Greek)dialect. Aeolic also has the broad _a_  (as in _Pelopidas_ and _Epaminondas)._ Before the 80’s it was more common to group Macedonian Greek with Aeolic than Doric, but since the discovery of the curse tablet (n 1986) opinion has swung towards Doric.

So, the extent that Macedonians spoke Greek, it was part of a northwest-Greek family including the speech of Epirus, Locris and the Peloponessus, or (less likely) the speech of Boeotia and the north Aegean. There’s not really enough information in our sources to do much more than note the possible similarities and wonder.

Its worth repeating the point that classifying Macedonian Greek is not, necessarily, classifying the “Ancient Macedonian language” proper — we don’t have enough information to know if there was other speech in historic Macedonia that would not be classified as part of the known Greek language. There are some Macedonian personal names that are clearly not ‘real’ Greek names at all: a name like _Sabattaras_ shares the same Doric-style ending but clearly references the Thracian/Phrygian cult of [Sabazios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabazios). Other unique Macedonian words seem to have closer cognates in [Phrygian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_language) or Thracian than Greek. Some surviving words suggest arms-length kinship to Greek, leading some scholars to propose [a “Hellenic” branch of Indo-European with Macedonian and Greek as siblings](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/joseph.1/articles/gancient.htm).

On the other hand, the distinctive features of Macedonian could simply reflect the age-old Balkan habit of borrowing words and features across linguistic and ethnic boundaries. Particularly if we imagine a Greek upper class ruling over a countryside of Thracians, Illyrians and Paeonians, the unusual words or forms might just be lingering aftereffects of colonization.

These are all, however, conjectures. Our evidence is simply not good enough to assert more than that with confidence. It’s worth remembering that the we know beyond contradiction that [Galatian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatian_language)was a Celtic language, but — despite the fact Galatian survived as a spoken language into the sixth century of our era — it left fewer than 200 attested words* in our sources. When Galatians wrote things down, it was in Greek despite what they were speaking at home. The surviving evidence just can not conclusively tell us how representative our handful of data is for the speech of the Macedonian population as a whole.

__TLDR__ : Macedonian Greek was most likely a close relative of Doric and the speech of Epirus and Locris. Whether there’s a separate Macedonian language dimly visible beyond our meager sources is hard to say, given the lack of evidence.



_*identified Macedonian words amount to about 350, so twice as many as Galatian._
