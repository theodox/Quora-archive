So far, anyway. All of the obvious names that come to mind -- China, Egypt, Rome, etc -- have "fallen" more than once, in the sense that catastrophic interruptions of society happen with somewhat scary regularity.

Egyptian history is a good example. Native Egyptian history -- before the Persian conquest in the 6th C BC -- runs a very impressive 2700 years. However it's divided up into 31 [dynasties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_Egyptian_dynasties), each of which represents a change in rulership; the mean time is only about a century per dynasty. Now, some of those changes are simply things like a royal line failing to produce enough heirs, or a successful coup which leaves the state intact. However historians also divide Egyptian history up into 6 major periods, of which 3 : the [First Intermediate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intermediate_Period_of_Egypt), the [Second Intermediate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intermediate_Period_of_Egypt), and the [Third Intermediate Period](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Intermediate_Period_of_Egypt) all represent periods of political instability and fragmentation. Moreover this doesn't even count foreign conquerors before the Persians, although we know of more than a couple.

There are analogies in Chinese history (with it's many dynasties, including foreign dynasties such as the [Yuan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty) and [Qing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty)) . Beside the obvious fall of Rome -- Western Rome in 476* and Eastern in 1453 -- there's things like Caesar's overthrow of the Roman Republic (is that the "fall" of the first Roman Empire and it's replacement by another) , or the Eastern empire's evolution into the Byzantine state -- at what point are those Greek-speaking Orthodox Christians still the heirs of the Latin-speaking Roman pagans?

There are, probably, some communities -- very small and geographically isolated -- which haven't ever been conquered by outsiders or experienced a major change of social conditions. But they live lives that are essentially unchanging: they are outside of history as the rest of us experience it. Once a society gets on the treadmill of history, it's doomed to fall off sometime. It can be a gentle fall or a hard one, but the [wheel of Fortuna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rota_Fortunae) never stops spinning
