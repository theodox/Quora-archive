Syntactically, a little bit — it uses familiar C-style formatting like curly braces and semicolons. MEL is actually derived from the scripting language [Tcl](https://www.tcl.tk/).

Nowadays if you’re doing serious work in Maya scripting, you should probably skip MEL and go straight to Python. Developing non-trivial tools in MEL involves a lot of extra work, and Maya Python gives you great access to lots of mature external tools and libraries.
