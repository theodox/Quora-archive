This is the conventional translation for the Greek word οἰκουμένη, _oikoumene,_ which originally meant something more or less like “inhabited lands”. It comes from a verb meaning to “settle” or “homestead”.

In early Greek usage it usually meant “inhabited by Greeks” as distinct from everywhere else — when Greeks were planting colonies all over the Mediterranean “the settlements” made a good shorthand for “places where there are Greeks.” However the more general meaning gradually took over — it as early as Aristotle (in the 4th century BC) it simply meant “places where people live.” It included other civilizations (India, Persia, Egypt) but also plenty of places the Greeks would have regarded as uncivilized, such as the Eurasian steppes or northern Europe. In this period there was a lot of debate about how big the potentially inhabitable world might be: there was a school of thought which held that the world close to the equator was too hot to support human life.

In the Roman period the word narrowed to mean essentially the Roman empire.

In Alexander’s day the word was transitioning between the first two meanings. At that point knowledge of lands far from the Mediterranean was pretty limited. To the west the [Carthaginians actively prevented Greek merchants from leaving the Mediterranean](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-right-that-the-Pillars-of-Hercules-marked-some-threat-to-navigation-in-the-Antique-era-which-is-why-navigators-of-Antiquity-didnt-colonize-the-Atlantic-coasts-of-Europe-and-Africa/answer/Steve-Theodore) in order to preserve their trade monopoly with the Atlantic world. To the east the Persian empire controlled access to Africa, India, and beyond (the sea route from Egypt to India would not be discovered for another couple of centuries, so the only connection lay some thousands of miles overland. Camels had not been domesticated west of Egypt, so the Sahara was rarely crossed. The interior of Europe wasn’t wealthy enough to attract many traders, especially since overland travel was slow and dangerous. The shores of the Black Sea were studded with Greek colonies, but knowledge of the lands beyond was mostly second hand since the steppes were home to dangerous and inhospitable nomadic tribes.

Before Alexander’s conquests, the Greek view of the world was roughly like this:
