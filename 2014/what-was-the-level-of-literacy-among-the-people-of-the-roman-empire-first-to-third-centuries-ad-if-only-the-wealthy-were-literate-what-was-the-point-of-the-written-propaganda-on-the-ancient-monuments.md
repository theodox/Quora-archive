# What was the level of literacy among the people of the Roman Empire (first to third centuries AD)? If only the wealthy were literate, what was the point of the written propaganda on the ancient monuments?

First off, the people you're propagandizing aren't necessarily the illiterate proles - they are your aristocratic rivals. Sticking "M. Agrippa fecit" in foot high letters across your big new temple is a great way of reminding less successful aristocrats who's on top of the heap. This isn't propaganda in the usual modern fashion, intended to convince or impress the masses: it's a marker of your _gloria_ , the achievements and bragging rights of your family. The real modern analogue is putting your name on a new campus building: it’s not there for the students.

The job we typically assign to propaganda - trying to generate support for a social or political agenda - is more likely to be done by visual imagery. Statuary is one obvious example - that's why you find so many nearly identical statues of Augustus (usually frozen in time somewhere in his 20's, looking a lot like a conventionalized version of Apollo): the message was "things are calm now - no more civil wars or scary military dynasts - it's all good with Augustus in charge"). You also see a lot of Augustus in traditional settings, say dressed as a priest offering sacrifice in the good old Roman way -- that's another way of saying "see, it's all back to the Good Old Days".

The other big vector for propaganda is spectacles: Triumphs, plays, games in the arena, and other big events. You parade through the city with your prisoners of war and the booty you've captured, or with all of your loyal followers making a long train through the streets as a way of impressing everybody with your achievements and prowess.

Or, you crucify people for sixty miles along the roads leading out of Rome to remind people - especially slaves - what happens to troublemakers.

It's also worth remembering that in a semi-literate society most people still know somebody who can read. We know that election campaigns, for example, generated a lot of graffiti (so did commercial advertising).

_Election “grafitti” — clearly paid-for political advertising — from Pompeii. Even if not all the passersby could read it, there’d be enough people on the street who could that it would be no mystery._ 

Lastly, of course you had a lot of crossover between literate society and the rest: poems and songs could cross back and forth quite easily, indeed that's one of the reasons why poetry was closely watched by those in power: as an easily memorable way to express ideas it was focus for both propaganda (the Aeneid!), criticism (Juvenal or Martial), or counter-cultural posing (Ovid).
