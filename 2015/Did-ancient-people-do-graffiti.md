# If one looks at the writings on the walls in the town, school and so on, most of them are just bunch of signatures and meaningless things. Did ancient people also do this, what are some examples, and how much ancient graffiti is in this form?

This is a bit of Greek graffiti carved into the leg of the giant statue of Ramses II at Abu Simbel. It was carved by Greek mercenaries working for [Amasis II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasis_II), the last native Egyptian Pharoah. It translates as


> 
When King Psammetichos came to Elephantine This was written by those who, with Psammetichos son of Theokles, Sailed and came above Kirkis, as far as the river permitted; Potasimto commanded the non-native speakers, and Amasis the Egyptians; Archon son of Amoibichos carved us with Pelekos son of Oudamos.


... the joke is that _Pelekos son of Oudamos_  means literally means 'hand axe, son of nobody'.
