It’s fairly likely that somebody would have cracked the code by now, since the there are many other bilingual Greek-Hieroglyphic inscriptions —[ at least 600 or so](http://www.classics.ox.ac.uk/event-reader/events/CPI.html) — which contain enough of the same information to[ make the decryption possible](https://www.quora.com/How-were-the-Hieroglyphics-deciphered/answer/Steve-Theodore). We might have had to wait a couple of decades more, but certainly by the late 19th century there were enough archaeologists combing over Egypt that they would have been found. We might be a couple of decades behind where we are now, but not much more than that.

I suspect the main difference would be fewer faux-Egyptian French tchotchkes like this, if [Egyptomania ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptomania)were pushed back by 30 or 40 years.
