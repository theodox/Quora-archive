Too many to count. Most Greek texts in the millennium after Alexander are koine, though there are exceptions

“Koine” just means “common” — koine is just the international standard Greek of the Hellenistic and Roman eras. The overwhelming majority of the Greek written between the third century BC and the sixth century AD is “koine,” though specialists can spot regional differences and changes over time. Just to pick a few random examples, a biographer like Plutarch, a scientist like Ptolemy, and a philosopher like Epictetus are all usually pegged as koine writers, though of course their individual styles vary a good deal.

Apart from oddball regional dialects, the main source of non-Koine Greek writing during the Hellenistic and Roman periods came from writers who tried to imitate the older Attic of classical Greece — a fad which came and went several times, with varying degrees of impact, all the way down to the end of the Byzantine era.
