There were others in antiquity but Herodotus is the closest in time, particularly if you’re looking for connected narrative. Every contemporary or near-contemporary historical source besides Herodotus is lost in whole or in part. Strictly speaking none of them are “primary” since they all exist as quotations or paraphrases in later, secondary sources.

Herodotus’ predecessor __[Hecataeus of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecataeus_of_Miletus)__ ____ was an active participant in the politics of the Ionian Revolt (he was pro-Persian, and his influence with the Persian victors helped win some leniency for that the Greek cities which were recaptured — apart from his own home city of Miletus, which the Persians depopulated). However he died just as Xerxes’ invasion was getting under way.

__[Ephorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephorus)__  wrote about a century and a half later than Herodotus. His work does not survive, but we see it quoted by authors who disagreed with Herodotus — for example Plutarch’s [De Herodoti malignitate](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0352) (“On the Malice of Herodotus”) tries to use Ephorus’s version of events to make it appear that Herodotus was biased against Boeotians. As a Boeotian himself, Plutarch was fond of any source which didn’t stress the enthusiasm his ancestors brought to service of the Great King. __[Diodorus Siculus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/11A*.html)__  also used Ephorus to provide a different version of events — he, as a patriotic Sicilian, didn’t like Herodotus’ cynical take on the refusal of the Sicilian leader [Gelon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelon) to provide help against the Persians.

The most interesting lost source is __[Ctesias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesias)__ , a Greek from Cnidus who served as a court physican to Artaxerxes II. His [Persika](http://etd.fcla.edu/UF/UFE0022521/nichols_a.pdf) exists only in quotations by other writers, but it would have a precious view of the conflict from the other side. Unfortunately he also has a reputation for unreliability — some of this might reflect Greek hostility to his pro-Persian stance, but he’s also connected to a lot of highly dubious Greek traditions about India — the legends of many monstrosities who populated Greek, Roman and medieval travellers’ tales, from [kynocephaloi ](https://www.quora.com/What-does-Theriocephaly-mean-Are-the-ancient-depictions-relating-to-theriocephaly-considered-true/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=5fe066cb&srid=zLvM)to [monopods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopod_(creature)), first show up in Ctesias.

__Plutarch’s__ biographies of [Themistocles](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Themistocles*.html) and [Cimon](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cimon*.html) cover events related to the war, and clearly indicate the existence of detailed sources which we no longer have. Plutarch was writing more than half a century after the events of the war. The likeliest missing pieces were probably covered by writers in the Athenian local tradition we know as [Atthidography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atthidographer); — these were not systematic large scale histories but they combined local Athenian oral traditions with different kinds of official annals; they resemble early Roman [Annalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annalists) and share their strengths and weaknesses.

As far as other contemporary but non-historical primary sources, there are a few plays and poems. The most famous is __the__ ___[Persians](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0012)___ ______ __of Aeschylus__ , who fought at Salamis and who celebrates that victory by imagining the way it was received at the Persian court. Pindar’s [1st Pythian Ode](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DP.), which alludes to Salamis and Plataea involves several interesting complexities: it celebrates the victory in Greece but also the victory of the Sicilian Greeks against Carthage at Himera (which Sicilian tradition always tried to position as an equally important victory for “Greece”). Only scraps survive of Simonides’ elegies on the victories of Plataea and Salamis. Literary evidence like this has to be treated very cautiously, of course, but it is valuable for showing us something of contemporary or near-contemporary attitudes about the conflict.
