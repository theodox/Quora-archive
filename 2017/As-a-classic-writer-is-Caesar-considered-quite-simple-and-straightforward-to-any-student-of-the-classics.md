Historically, yes — Caesar was often used as s second year text for students getting beyond basic grammar and practice exercises. He uses a _lot_ of indirect discourse, which makes him a bit hard at first but acts as excellent drill in that form of construction.

Caesar’s prose is more complex than that makes it sound. He’s not usually hard to read, but he is a canny politician writing with an eye towards influencing public opinion so what he writes is carefully calculated. Cicero — who had no great love for Caesar the human being — still admired Caesar’s lucid prose and pacing. Here’s what he had to say about the _Gallic Wars_ 

> [They] merit the highest approbation: for they are plain, correct, and graceful, and divested of all the ornaments of language, so as to appear (if I may be allowed the expression) in a kind of undress. But while he pretended only to furnish the loose materials, for such as might be inclined to compose a regular history, he may, perhaps, have gratified the vanity of a few literary embroiderers; but he has certainly prevented all sensible men from attempting any improvement on his plan. For in history, nothing is more pleasing than a correct and elegant brevity of expression.
