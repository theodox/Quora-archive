According to the license:

> Students and educators have free* access to Autodesk software subject to Educational stand-alone licenses through the Autodesk Education Community.

> Participants must study or be employed at a “[Qualified Educational Institution](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/article/eligibility-edu-institutions)” and may only use these licenses on a personal device for purposes directly related to learning, teaching, training, research, or development.

> Mentors or competitors in an Autodesk-sponsored competition may also be eligible.

> _Note:_  You may be required to provide proof that you satisfy one or more of these eligibility requirements.

I think that means you’ll need to provide some proof of course enrollment or something to get a license. You may be able to do this legally if you’re enrolled in, say, a community college course or even an on-line course — I’m not sure about the details and the ADSK website doesn’t provide much. I know that kids camps like [ID Tech](https://www.idtech.com/?gclid=CN7Wxs61hdACFRSIfgodRjEJGw) do get the student maya licenses, so I’d assume the requirements aren’t too strict — but I think the only way to be sure is to ask.

There is always [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) as a free alternative if you can’t figure out how to get a Maya license. You can definitely get a 30 day free trial of Maya but that’s not nearly enough for meaningful learning.

In any case, the free versions produces regular Maya images. Some features useful for pipeline integration are disabled (Maya LT doesn’t support Python, for example) but they are fine for building a portfolio.
