The general features of an ancient republic -- a set of magistracies controlled by an aristocratic elite and an 'assembly' (the Roman _comitium_ ) of all the men capable of military service -- are very common in the Mediterranean world after the end of the Bronze age: The details differed a lot from city to city, but most of the Greek cities of southern Italy and many of the other nations of Italy (Latins, Sabines, Umbrians, etct) were organized this way. It's also common in most Greek city states of the same period.

As for "why" -- well, in a mostly agrarian economy, it's actually pretty touch to centralize power into the hands of one person. Monarchies were very common in places like Egypt or Mesopotamia where prosperity depended on big, complex engineering projects like irrigation: in those places a centralized administration offered more effective organization on the big, shared systems that everybody depended on. In Greece and Italy, on the other hand, rural land owners could be pretty self sufficient (particularly at the beginning of this period, when trade and commerce were not very well developed). This made it hard for monarchies to take root. There were lots of attempts, but few of them lasted for more than a generation or two: a city-state is rarely rich enough to support a monarch, a court, and above all the standing army that the king needs if he gets unpopular. When states got bigger - say, after Alexander the great -- monarchies became very common.

The typical iron-age republic really started as a kind of alliance of clans, not entirely unlike modern Afghanistan: the 'patricians', as heads of powerful families, could get together and make collective decisions (most of which were about war and peace with other groups). More controversial questions get passed along to a vote of all the possible fighters: it's ultimately a way of figuring out who'd win if it came down to fighting (there was a similar institution among the Vikings, for the same reason. Raising your right hand to vote was a way of counting up how many swords would be available to back a particular decision) Without a lot of money, or at least a healthy agricultural surplus, there's not enough wealth to support a professional army that could enforce the will of a king.

Interestingly there is an earlier layer of societies, going back to the days of the Mycenaeans and Cretans, which did involve kings: but those societies were comparatively rich, and benefited from international trade with Egypt and the Near East; after the [Late Bronze Age collapse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse) the northern Mediterranean was poorer and could not support kings and their armies, leading to lots of little republics of various kinds.

The Etruscans, who were much wealthier (they were traders and famously talented metalworkers) ended up ruling over Rome briefly. They were rich enough to have kings and a more professional military -- but they also earned a bad name with their Roman subjects, who eventually chased them out and refused to entertain the idea of kings for another 500 years, as the other answers note. At that point, they reverted to the lifestyle of most of their neighbors: an aristocratic republic. Rome's original contribution to this common way of life was a system designed to prevent anybody else from attempting to become king -- having two consuls with equal power who served for only a single year was intended to make it impossible for a magistrate to amass too much power. This suited the interests of the rural nobility, both because it prevented the rise of another tyrant and also because it made sure all the big families could get at least an occasional shot at the top job.
