Romans generally did not use any formal honorifics in the Republican period, or for a long time after. In fact [the metamorphosis of “Caesar” from a personal into a title is tribute to the unease Romans had with titles in the first century or so of the empire](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Caesar-come-to-mean-emperor-Why-did-all-Roman-emperors-call-themselves-Caesar-of-Rome/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=fff5fa67&srid=zLvM).

So, if you were an equal you’d simply address him by name: _Gaius Julius_  or or _Gaius Caesar_ , or simply _Caesar_ . If you were a social or military inferior you might again use one of those, although the last is probably the most likely — however to show respect you would probably toss in one of the many flattering adjectives which Romans used as marks of esteem. For example if you were in trouble it might be _clemens Caesar_ , “merciful Caesar” and if you were grateful for a gift it might be _liberalissime Caesar_ , “most generous Caesar.” You might also leave off the “Caesar” altogether and simply use an adjective: _potentissime, “_ most powerful one”. It’s clunky in English but the use of adjectives as substantives is a regular feature of all kinds of Latin.

In some contexts a Latin speaker would start to address a person with the word “O” (a usage which was still common in English poetry into the 19th century). We don’t know for sure, but it’s a good bet that Roman manners read a lot of meaning into the intonation of that “O”, but it’s not easy to recover; it tends to be an indication of extremes of emotion but not always. Among friends or lovers, “mi” (more or less, “my”) was an affectionate greeting but it’s very unlikely to be used on a social superior. Mi may have been primarily a letter-writer’s word rather than something said in person, somewhat like “dear” in English.

A friendly reference to Caesar in the third person might be “noster Caesar,” “our Caesar” (there’s a similar usage in British English today).

Lastly many Romans would use a system of nicknames to refer to people. This was partially a literary habit acquired from Greece; a particularly obscure reference was a mark of your education. However it also offered figleaf of deniability if your letters or conversations got back to their targets. Pompey attracted many of hostile nicknames, such as _Arabarches,_ “the king of the Arabs”) and _Epicrates,_ after a corrupt Athenian polititcian. Caesar had fewer but, significantly, one of them was _rex,_ “the king”. Of course sometimes even an unflattering nickname was a mark of affection: Caesar’s own troops called him _moechus calvus,_ “[the bald adulterer](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html),” because of his reputation with the ladies and his notorious touchiness about his own thinning hair.
