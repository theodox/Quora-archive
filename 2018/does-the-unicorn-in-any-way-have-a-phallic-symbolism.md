You mean, the unicorn that’s got a giant, erect tubular object sticking out of its forehead?

The unicorn that rolls over and goes to sleep when that big tubular object is laid in the lap of a virgin?

The unicorn that might be a rhino, whose horn today is highly sought-after as a natural alternative to Viagra?

All sarcasm aside, there’s a great discussion of the whole business in [The Spoor of the Unicorn by Avram Davidson](https://www.baen.com/Chapters/9781625791177/9781625791177___1.htm), which puts it better than I can.
