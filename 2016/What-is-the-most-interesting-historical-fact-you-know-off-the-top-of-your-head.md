__The Elephant Arms Race__ 

When Alexander's empire split apart into rival power blocs on his death in 323 BC, the map looked like this:

Despite the huge disparities in size, the 3 key powers* - the Kingdom of Macedonia (blue), Egypt under the Ptolemies (orange) and what became known as the Seleucid Empire (green) were evenly matched on the battlefield.

The Seleucids, however, had one critical advantage their rivals couldn't match: with their eastern border in what's now Pakistan and Afghanistan, they had access to India -- a lucrative source of trade, but more importantly to the warlords _the only place to get war elephants:_

How much did this matter? It was significant enough that [Seleucus Nicator ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_I_Nicator)traded all of Alexander's Indian conquests west of the Indus to [Chandragupta ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_Maurya)in return for 500 elephants.

This left the other successor kingdoms in a bind: the only source of a new, critical weapon lay in the hands of their enemies. But the resourceful Ptolemies embarked on a bold new high-tech weapons program: using their contacts with Ethiopia and Sudan they embarked on a daring effort to _domesticate the African elephant._ 

They dispatched scouting parties to "Aethiopia" (really modern Sudan) and "Troglodytica" (the Red Sea coast down as far as Somalia)** They bartered and traded with the Meroitic [kingdom of Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush) for access to the elephant herds -- there are a some surviving records of the payoffs, though in other cases local elephant-hunting people fought back against the outsiders who were monopolizing their traditional food source. The hunts themselves were so difficult and dangerous that the leaders of successful expeditions erected altars to commemorate their 'victories' over the elephants, following the ancient Greek battlefield custom. To bring the captured elephants back they had to devise special transport ships -- the largest regular shipping ever built in the Greek world -- and reopen an ancient Pharaonic canal linking the Nile and the Red Sea.

_Ptolemy II marches in triumph through Alexandria in a chariot pulled by a team of 4 African elephants**_ 

When the captured elephants finally arrived at the huge, newly established training center at Memphis they had to be domesticated. Elephant trainers from India were smuggled across Seleucid territory and set to work training the elephants - an entirely different species from the long-domesticated Indian variety***. Alongside the training there were a host of complex logistical problems to solve, from feeding the elephants (at its height, the herd may have numbered 500 or more elephants) to providing them with armor and fortified castles to house their crews .

Like good militarists, the Ptolemies found proxies to test out their new systems. When king Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Italy in 279, his army included 20 lend-lease elephants: a gift from Ptolemy. The elephants formed an important part of Pyrrhus’ victory over the Romans at [Asculum.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Asculum_(279_BC))

Finally in 217 BC came the long-expected superpower showdown. At the [battle of Raphia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Raphia) the new Ptolemaic elephantry faced off against its relentless, elephant-equipped Seleucid foes. The Seleucid army of 68,000 brought a hundred crack Indian elephants to the conflict -- but the Ptolemaic army of 75,000 included 78 elephants: the product of decades of the Egyptian military-agricultural complex's finest work. As the two armies ranged up against each other the Seleucids found their own elephant corps directly opposed by the new Ptolemaic elephantry. The two emperors faced off directly against each other, Ptolemy on his own left flank and Selecus on his right, each surrounded by the pick of his elephants.

The result was a debacle for Egypt. The African elephants -- unused to the sight and smell of another elephant species -- panicked. Fleeing they trampled Ptolemy's household guards, disordering the whole left flank and endangering the emperor himself. Seleucus, at the head of his own elephant corp, pressed the broken Egyptian wing hard, confident of victory. However the solid Egyptian phalanx held the line and then counterattacked, leaving the rest of the Seleucid army in a shambles: the Ptolemies had won the day in spite of, rather than because of their expensive wonder weapons.

Like military bureaucrats everywhere, though, the Egyptian army refused to give up on their investments: Egypt continued to pursue elephant training until at least the reign of Ptolemy VI (died 145). Although the African elephants could not face off against their Indian cousins they were still intimidating enough to conventional enemies. It's probably no coincidence that the Carthaginians started their own elephant corps after the Ptolemies' breakthrough: though we don't have any existing sources which describe how the Carthaginians got their elephants, it's a good bet that some of the elephant-training know-how that the Ptolemies paid so much for ended up in the hands of Hannibal.



_* simplifications intentional :)_ 

_** The same procession, according to Athenaeus, included "a goldern phallus 180 feet long, bedecked with ribbons". He does not say whether this, too, was drawn by elephants._ 

*** _In Greek, Cape Guardafui - the tip of the "horn of Africa" was όρος Ἐλέφας: Mount Elephant)_ 

_**** There is debate between scholars who think these were a now-extinct species of North African forest elephants (smaller than the Asian variety) or the familiar African elephants which are notably larger._
