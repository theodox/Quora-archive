# Is it true that Cicero once said that the Anglo-Saxons were so ignorant that he was unsure that they could be turned into good slaves?

Definitely not ‘Anglo-Saxons ‘, that’s a grouping that would not exist until after the end of the Roman Empire in the west, many centuries after Cicero’s time. The actual quote is from a letter Cicero wrote to his friend Atticus:

> The outcome of the war in Britain is being awaited. For it is certain that the approaches to the island are guarded with wonderful strength. Moreover it is now known that there is not an ounce of silver in that island, nor any hope of booty except of slaves. Of these I do not believe you need expect any trained in letters, music, or poetry.

_[Cicero: ad Atticum IV](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/att4.shtml)_ , around 54 BC. It's worth mentioning that as a political adversary of Caesar, Cicero is trying to make the expedition look like a waste of time — although it's true that it's unlikely Britain at that time boasted many potential secretaries or poets that.a Roman would be interested in.
