I think it's unlikely. Pictographic writing has been invented independently several times, so I don't think it's a strong connection. The character forms in both languages reflect their writing tools - pens in China, and reed styluses in Sumer - which both make bold strokes easier than Egyptian-style lines, encouraging simplifications. I think the similarity is more apparent than real.

More importantly, we have a pretty decent understanding of spoken Sumerian, since cuneiform can be used syllabically as well as ideographically and we have a cuneiform dictionaries of Sumerian, Akkadian and other Mesopotamian languages. There does not seem to be a lot of overlap between basic Sumerian vocabulary and any Chinese dialect (by contrast, you can see the very similar root words for basic ideas "mother", "father", "brother" or "water" in Greek, Persian, Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages. Moreover Sumerian seems to have been a multi-syllablic language with a lot of long compound words, whereas Chinese is mostly monosyllabic. As far as we know Sumerian is not related to any other language. Here's a Sumerian word list: [Sumerian words and language 1](http://history-world.org/Sumerianwords1.htm) to give an example of the sounds.

There is, however, a small minority of scholars who think the language might be part of the same family as Chinese and Tibetan: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language)
