There are a lot of good reasons why many ancient societies tried to protect messengers, heralds, ambassadors or other diplomatic functionaries.

1) If I kill your heralds, you'll probably kill mine. So how do I tell you my demands? Or, for that matter, how do I negotiate my own surrender? 

2) In an information poor society, any news (even lies!) has value. If I kill strangers on sight, I'll be less likely to get visitors. So when the big barbarian horde shows up I won't find out about it until they are on my doorstep, or I won't know that there's a famine down the river and my grain is now worth a lot more money.

3) In most ancient warfare, the enemies are your neighbors, and alliance patterns shift all the time. Greeks fight Persians a few times in a century. Greeks fight other Greeks every few years. So it's likely that today's enemies are last year's allies and vice versa. Since you're all neighbors, the emissary is probably somebody you've done business with, or who married your cousin, or who was a house guest in peacetime. Killing him is bad for reasons (1) and (2) but also because you need those contacts in peace time (the Greek name for this is _[Xenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_%28Greek%29)_ , the Latin _[Hospitium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitium)_ _.)._ When the war is over, whoever wins will use his personal friends to negotiate the peace and try to keep the defeated state friendly. You don't send unpopular people as heralds unless you are deliberately trying to provoke a fight.

For all these reasons most ancient societies evolved a system for asserting the rights of non-combatant go-betweens: something like today's idea of diplomatic immunity. The value of information, combined with the fact that small, loosely connected communities often have to communicate through family back-channels rather than through a permanent civil service, means that this is an important convention that is widely respected. Typically this protection involves both a religious dimension ("Zeus _Xenios_  will punish you if you harm a herald") and an element of aristocratic or warrior honor code ("No gentleman would lay hands on a herald"). 

As international politics got more complex, there was also an obligation on the emissaries themselves not to do anything more than deliver messages and negotiate: at many points (particularly in the [Hellenistic era](http://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/hellenistic-greece) and the Italian Renaissance) "diplomat" and "spy" were almost synonymous. When that was true, violating your obligations as an emissary could lead to a sudden change of career and/or height. 

These prohibitions are still social conventions, and in antiquity there is not much in the way of international law to give them teeth. Decency, honor and worries about reputation are powerful motivators but not forces of nature. Of course, that's equally true today: attacks on embassies are not unheard of, diplomats are occasionally killed, and certainly many governments ignore the protections nominally accorded to the Red Cross or other non-combatants and NGOs. The ultimate protection the same today as it was for the Babylonians: the murder of an emissary is a legitimate cause for war. 

All that said, violations are fairly rare. Under most circumstances it's just easier and cheaper to abide by the conventions, since it's very uncommon for a herald, ambassador or diplomat to be worth fighting over. Exceptions tend to cluster in a handful of situations:

__Popular Outrage.__ No matter what the king or the government thinks, an angry mob might take out its anger on a particularly offensive or unpopular emissary. The most famous example is probably the case of the Persian heralds thrown into a well by the Spartans for conveying a demand for submission from emperor Darius. 



> 7.133] King Xerxes had sent no heralds either to Athens or Sparta to ask earth and water, for a reason which I will now relate. When Darius some time before sent messengers for the same purpose, they were thrown, at Athens, into the pit of punishment, at Sparta into a well, and bidden to take therefrom earth and water for themselves, and carry it to their king. On this account Xerxes did not send to ask them. What calamity came upon the Athenians to punish them for their treatment of the heralds I cannot say, unless it were the laying waste of their city and territory; but that I believe was not on account of this crime.

>  [7.134] On the Lacedaemonians, however, the wrath of Talthybius, Agamemnon's herald, fell with violence. Talthybius has a temple at Sparta; and his descendants, who are called Talthybiadae, still live there, and have the privilege of being the only persons who discharge the office of herald. When therefore the Spartans had done the deed of which we speak, the victims at their sacrifices failed to give good tokens; and this failure lasted for a very long time. Then the Spartans were troubled; and, regarding what had befallen them as a grievous calamity, they held frequent assemblies of the people, and made proclamation through the town, "Was any Lacedaemonian willing to give his life for Sparta?" Upon this two Spartans, Sperthias, the son Aneristus, and Bulis, the son of Nicolaus, both men of noble birth, and among the wealthiest in the place, came forward and freely offered themselves as an atonement to Xerxes for the heralds of Darius slain at Sparta. So the Spartans sent them away to the Medes to undergo death.


Xerxes (Darius heir) didn't kill them in return:



> Then Xerxes answered with true greatness of soul "that he would not act like the Lacedaemonians, who, by killing the heralds, had broken the laws which all men hold in common. As he had blamed such conduct in them, he would never be guilty of it himself. And besides, he did not wish, by putting the two men to death, to free the Lacedaemonians from the stain of their former outrage."


Good PR? A curse? Basic decency? A little of all three?

__Intrigue.__ Since attacking a herald is a good excuse for a war, sometimes heralds are killed by a war party or somebody trying to provoke a conflict. It's a good way to drag an unwilling state into war if you're bent on fighting. For non-lethal example, [Lucius Appuleius Saturninus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Appuleius_Saturninus) created a diplomatic incident by insulting an embassy from Mithradates of Pontus, partly for domestic political reasons but also in hopes of creating a war that his sponsor [Gaius Marius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Marius) could fight and win. 

__Stupidity.__  Never underestimate the ability of hotheads to make things worse. When Queen Teuta of the Illyrians felt disrespected by a Roman embassy, she had the ambassador assassinated, thereby precipitating the first [Illyrian War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrian_Wars).

__Breaking the rules.__ If the diplomats cross the line into combat or espionage they are no longer protected. A Roman embassy tried to stop the Gauls from attacking Clusium, but when the Gauls insulted them they joined up with the defenders and fought the Gauls. This was widely regarded as a breach of office, even in Rome, accodring to [Appian](http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_gallic_2.html), although the Romans didn't actually surrender the renegade diplomats on demand - precipitating the [Battle of the Allia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Allia) and the sack of Rome, as well as illustrating relation between power politics and diplomatic conventions.
