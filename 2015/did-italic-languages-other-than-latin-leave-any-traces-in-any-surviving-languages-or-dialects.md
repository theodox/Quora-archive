I don't think so. Most of the regional languages were effectively dead by the 1st century - they were similar enough to Latin that they basically dissolved into the Latin context. There might be some technical terms -- stuff life _medius_ /_meddix_  (a magistrate's title) -- that survive in a literary context. It's quite probable that some Latin words might be borrowings from neighbors but without a good time series for citations we can't really tell; inscriptions in non-Latin Italic languages exist but they aren't that common and there's no non-Latin literary sources.

This (elderly) article : [1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica/Sabini](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Sabini) suggests that the mixing started very early - it cites _bos_  (cow, as our "bovine") as an example of borrowing from Samnite. There are, of course, place names too.
