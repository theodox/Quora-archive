# Were hoplites proficient in close-quarters combat outside of the phalanx formation, or were they entirely dependent on that formation to remain an effective fighting force?

Great answers here, and the overall takeaway - that hoplite training focuses on cohesion and formation fighting instead of solo combat - is spot on. I would point out though that the traditional Greek training regimen included wrestling, boxing, and the [Pankration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankration), all of which were pretty standard for members of the hoplite class (although it is noted in several places that the prettier boys avoided the pankration and boxing, lest they lose their good looks to a broken nose or bitten ear). 

Pankration in particular was a pretty brutal unarmed combat style, including eye-gouges and biting as well as kicks, punches and throws. It was dangerous enough that the Olympic rules stipulated that anyone who died in the ring won in order to discourage killing blows (or also to encourage suicidal courage?). A well trained pankratiast would be a formidable one-v-one fighter with or without a xiphos. 

Of course, most hoplite armies were semi-professional at best. Apart from the Spartans and mercenaries, the average hoplite was a gentleman farmer or wealthy townsman (you had to provide your own equipment, so the poor were not hoplites). Many of these were not in the best of shape or training all the time. Hoplite tactics - like those of the French revolutionary armies - were well adapted to less-than-perfectly trained solders. One of the reasons Alexander's successors used mercenaries so extensively is the fact that the mercenaries - even though politically unreliable - were a lot better than the average citizen soldier.
