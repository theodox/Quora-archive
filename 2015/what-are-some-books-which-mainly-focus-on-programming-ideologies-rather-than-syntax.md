[The Art of Readable Code](http://amzn.to/1IWVU3h) is a cross-language book that does a wonderful job of exploring the realities of programming outside of language concerns.

[Clean Code](http://amzn.to/1M2U2an) is all Java in its examples, but the principles and practices it covers aren't Java-specific

[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://amzn.to/1Ldai7L), usually known as "GOF" for the 'Gang of Four' authors who wrote it, is a language agnostic look at many common object-oriented problems.
