It’s literally ‘having the head of an animal’. It’s a common factor in the many garbled descriptions of far-off lands and their supposed exotic inhabitants which started circulating in ancient Greece and eventually found their way into various medieval bestiaries.

In general, these seem to have their ultimate origins in distorted third hand accounts of real things. The most famous example are the [Cynocephali,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynocephaly) who were supposed to have the heads of dogs:

Like many of these kinds of stories, opinions are divided on what real-world phenomenon this refers to. Some scholars think this is a not-entirely-crazy way of describing mandrills or baboons: later Greek writers themselves seem to have used the word for those animals.

However the story might instead be a misunderstanding of a bit of ethnography: some scholars think this is a Greek author recycling some derogatory comments by one set of Indians about another. One of the older texts (from the Greek traveller in Persian service, [Ctesias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesias)) says this

> On these [the Indian] mountains there live men with the head of a dog, whose clothing is the skin of wild beasts. They speak no language, but bark like dogs, and in this manner make themselves understood by each other. Their teeth are larger than those of dogs, their nails like those of these animals, but longer and rounder. They inhabit the mountains as far as the river Indos. Their complexion is swarthy. They are extremely just, like the rest of the Indians with whom they associate. They understand the Indian language but are unable to converse, only barking or making signs with their hands and fingers by way of reply, like the deaf and dumb. They are called by the Indians Kalystrii, in Greek Kynocephaloi. They live on raw meat and number about 120,000 .

This has been connected by some scholars with the low-caste group known as [Shvapakas](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/shvapaka), who were ritually impure and forced to live outside of settled areas — their only possessions were supposed to be dogs. The name in Sanskrit can be interpreted as “dog-cookers” (because of their limited economic opportunities) or “nourished by dogs” (which would, in most traditional Indian contexts, explain why they were so ritually impure). Pass that information on to a Greek traveller through an imperfect translation and you get a race of dog-men and a legend which takes on a long life of its own disconnected from any Indian reality, up to and including an [Orthodox tradition that St. Christoper had a dog’s head.](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Saint-Christopher-depicted-as-a-Cynocephaly)

Generally you won’t find serious scholars who believe these stories are true. Naysayers will simply point them out as evidences of ignorance or superstition. Typically, this involves the belief (itself, ironically, a myth) that this was a medieval mistake when in fact it was simple garden-variety Greco-Roman “science”. Scholars who know the sources usually try to trace them back to either distorted depictions of real things — like baboons, which are in fact pretty difficult to describe to an audience that’s not familiar with them or even with monkeys — or to cross-cultural misunderstandings that were simply repeated and gradually mythologized down the centuries.
