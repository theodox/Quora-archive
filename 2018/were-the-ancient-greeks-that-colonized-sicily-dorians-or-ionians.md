The northern half of the island — Himera, Zancle and Leontinoi for example — was mostly colonized by Ionian speakers, mostly from the Euboean city of [Chalcis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcis).

The southern half was mostly Doric. Syracuse was a colony of Corinth, Gela from Crete, and Selinous from Megara.
