As everybody else has noted, _liber_  means both ‘free’ in the sociopolitical sense and ‘book’. _Liber_ is also a proper name, to make things more confusing — it’s one the alternate identities of [Bacchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber).

If you’re looking for the other English meaning of_free_ , ie, ‘no cost’, you’d want _gratis._
