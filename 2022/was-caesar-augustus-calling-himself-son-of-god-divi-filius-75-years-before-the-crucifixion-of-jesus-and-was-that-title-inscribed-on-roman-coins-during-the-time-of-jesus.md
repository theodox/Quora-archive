# Was Caesar Augustus calling himself "Son of God" ("Divi filius") 75 years before the crucifixion of Jesus and was that title inscribed on Roman coins during the time of Jesus?

75 years is roughly correct for the date (assuming the traditional dating of the crucifixion in 33) since the Roman Senate divinized Julius Caesar in 42 BC.

There are plenty of coins alluding to this because the association with Caesar was a key part of Augustus’s political position — it’s not a coincidence that the Senate which voted divine honors did so while the Marc Antony and Octavian (not yet Augustus) were hunting Brutus and Cassius through Greece. Augustus issued over 130 coin types which used DIVI FILIUS or various abbreviations thereof.

_This example is from 36 BC; on the face its inscribed IMP. CAESAR. DIVI. F. III. VIR. ITER. R. P. C. and on the obverse it has a picture of the (still unbuilt) temple of Julius Caesar. The final temple was not completed until 29, and had six rather than four columns. When completed it bore the legend DIVO IUL, “to the divine Julius” on its pediment as shown in the coin._ 

However, you can’t translate DIVI FILIUS as “son of God.”

Latin has no definite article: there’s no easy verbal distinction between “a god,” “the god,” and capital-G God. In this case there’s no doubt whatsoever what paternity Augustus was claiming — his legitimacy derived from his position as Julius Caesar’s adopted son, and he was not going to let anyone forget it. That’s why the coin above shows the temple of Divus Julius: Augustus was trumpeting his descent from the revered Caesar. The star on the temple pediment symbolizes the comet which supposedly appeared at Caesar’s death, heralding his ascension to the heavens.

_An earlier coin, when the future emperor was still Octavian. At left, Julius Caesar as DIVOS JULIUS (an interesting and probably intentionally old-fashioned spelling) and at right, Octavian himself on as CAESAR DIVI F. The message is plain, right down to parallel portraits — in real life Julius Caesar was 37 years older than Octavian._ 

In any case, the former Caesar was not _exactly_ a God. [Caesar was proclaimed a divus, a mortal who had achieved a special status in the afterlife](https://www.quora.com/After-Julius-Caesar-was-deified-after-his-death-did-he-become-the-god-of-something-or-did-he-just-become-Julius-Caesar-the-God/answer/Steve-Theodore). He was not a _deus,_  a god on the order of Jupiter or Mars. In many ways “saint,” is a closer fit for the concept as it worked in Roman religion (later churchmen actually recycled _divus_ as a synonym for “saint”)_._ A _divus_ fit somewhere on the ladder below the Olympians and above the _di parentes,_ the ancestors who every Roman family honored with prayers and sacrifices.

So Augustus was the son of Julius the _divus_ , but not the “Son of God.” He accumulated a lot of company: most later emperors ended up as _divi_ well into Christian times. The last emperor to bear the title after death was Anastasius (died 518). Church correspondence still used it to refer to dead emperors at least into the 8th century.

All that said, the ancient world at the beginning of our era was positively chockablock with sons of gods, mostly thanks to the example of Alexander the Great [who declared himself the son of Zeus](https://www.quora.com/Have-you-heard-that-Alexander-the-Great-was-declared-a-Son-of-God/answer/Steve-Theodore). All of the Ptolemaic kings and most of the Seleucids used divine titles — and no coy Roman substitutes, it was the full panoply. Here’s Seleucid king Antiochus IV:

_Seleucid emperor Antiochus IV, left, and Zeus at right. The legend is BAΣIΛEΩΣ ANTIOXOY ΘEOY EΠIΦANOY, “Of king Antiochus the manifest god”_ 

Antiochus, of course, [actually did get himself into the Bible](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/1maccabees/1) — by demanding that the Jews worship Zeus, which of course meant himself. He’s the mustache-twirling villain [in the Hannukah story.](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/antiochus-the-madman/) Which of course illustrates why it’s not wise to read much into the claims of any particular god-king: Jewish people have kept his story vividly alive for over two millennia without somehow mistaking him for God with a capital G.

In fact, it’s worth pointing out that Jewish, and later Christian attitude towards a lot of their neighbors’ gods was precisely “Just a bunch of dead kings.”

This is from the Book of Wisdom (14:15-21):

> a father, afflicted with untimely mourning, made an image of the child so quickly taken from him, and now honored as a god what once was dead and handed down to his household mysteries and sacrifices Then, in the course of time, the impious practice gained strength and was observed as law, and graven things were worshiped by royal decrees. People who lived so far away that they could not honor him in his presence copied the appearance of the distant king and made a public image of him they wished to honor, out of zeal to flatter the absent one as though present, and to promote this observance among those to whom it was strange, the artisan’s ambition provided a stimulus. For he, perhaps in his determination to please the ruler, labored over the likeness to the best of his skill; and the masses, drawn by the charm of the workmanship, soon took as an object of worship the one who shortly before was honored as a human being.

> And this became a snare for the world, that people enslaved to either grief or tyranny conferred the incommunicable Name on stones and wood.

It’s a rather a stretch to think that people who wrote that (around the same time Caesar was converted into a _divus_ at knifepoint) would fall for the idea that Augustus was their Messiah. Augustus was fairly popular with the Jews but not _that_ popular. By the end of the first century, with [Jerusalem a smoking ruin thanks to Roman armies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(70_CE)#:~:text=The%20siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20of,the%20Roman%20province%20of%20Judaea.) and hundreds of thousands of Jews enslaved, it beggars belief. [People have long memories for this sort of thing.](https://forward.com/opinion/450377/the-arch-of-titus-must-come-down/)

Of course those who disagree can commune also with Divus Theodosius on [this page](http://www.romanimperialcult.org/Anastasius_I.html). Sure, he made Christianity the Roman state religion — but he still got to be a _divus,_ so we can give it a couple of thousand years and see what happens.
