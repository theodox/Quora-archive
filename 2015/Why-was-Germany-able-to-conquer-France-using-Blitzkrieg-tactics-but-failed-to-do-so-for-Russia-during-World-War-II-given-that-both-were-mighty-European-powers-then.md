# Why was Germany able to conquer France using Blitzkrieg tactics but failed to do so for Russia during World War II given that both were mighty European powers then?

As most answers have pointed out, the conquest of a giant continental-sized power like Russia and that of a country you can cross by car in a long day's drive is an important differentiator. However there were radical weaknesses in the French position that had little to do with geography.

French society entered the war effort with deep social and political divisions. After the [Nazi-Soviet Pact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact#Soviet.E2.80.93German_relations_during_the_Pact.27s_operation) French Communists, who took their cues from Moscow, regarded the war as an inter-capitalist struggle and remained aloof or sabotaged the war effort: there were strikes in munitions factories while the war was going on (though these declined once real fighting started). The French left in general was highly suspicious of the army, while the army in turn had more than few authoritarians who sympathized with the Nazi's opposition to the Bolsheviks, if not their ambitions against French territory and power. To top all of it off, the propaganda surrounding the Spanish Civil War had encouraged all sides to regard aerial bombardments as a terrible, all-consuming form of destruction: civilians attempting to escape another [Guernica](http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/guernica.htm) proved to be a constant distraction to French troops particularly once the battle lines began to move rapidly.

On the battlefield these divisions produced the timidity, inflexibility and disorganization which characterized the brief period of high energy fighting. The army was extremely nervous about the willingness of its own soldiers to fight, both because of ideological divisions and also because of the brutal legacy of [Verdun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Verdun) : the infamous defensive strategy based on the Maginot line was not just an overly enthusiastic attempt to perfect the tactics of WWI: it was also based on the memory of the last two years of the war in which significant mutinies and passive resistance to orders had left the French army almost incapable of offensive operations. Recognizing that the fortification line was an effort to fight a defensive, relatively "safe" war that could be conducted by a shaky army.

The combination of these factors left the French army hamstrung. On paper it was a powerful force: the combined Franco-British outnumbered the Germans in material and men, but poor coordination between the allies and ineffective use of resources by the French left France uniquely vulnerable.

For a moving contemporary account from a French perspective, the medieval historian and army reservist [Marc Bloch](http://www.marcbloch.fr/) wrote a [memoir](http://www.amazon.com/Strange-Defeat-Marc-Bloch/dp/0393319113) of the defeat from a Nazi POW camp which is worth reading. Its hardly definitive account -- he died at the hands of the Gestapo in 1944, and most of the writing was done in prison -- but it gives a visceral understanding of the fog of indecision and timidity which blinded the French. The valor of individual soldiers and units was wasted in a fight that was tactically unequal due to terrible strategic disadvantages.
