That’s a diagnosis that has been suggested [several times since the 1940’s](https://www.jstor.org/stable/283354?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), and it fits several of the reported symptoms.

However, if he did it was a somewhat unusual and fairly mild case. CP sufferers rarely have good fine motor control in their hands, but we know Claudius was a writer before he became emperor. While it’s possible he used a secretary for dictation, there is no mention in the sources of an inability to use a pen. Also, Claudius lived to be 63*; CP is associated with respiratory or coronary problems which Claudius seems not to have had.

An alternative diagnosis is [Dystonia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystonia), which is superficially similar but less severe and less likely to impact a victim’s lifespan. Dystonia can be triggered by encephalitis, which might accord with the story that Claudius developed his symptoms after a childhood illness.

Another recent suggestion is [Tourette’s Syndrome.](https://lifeasahuman.com/2012/feature/tourettes-disorder-the-imperial-gene/) The suggestion in that case is that this was a Julio-Claudian genetic inheritance and that Claudius’s stammer and limp stemmed from the same cause as the moody perversions of Tiberius and the megalomania of Caligula. However this seems like a poor match for the recorded symptoms, and there’s no evidence for the characteristic verbal symptoms of Tourette’s in our sources.

There is a good roundup up the medical evidence in this [article](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/014107680009300414), which advocates for dystonia as the correct diagnosis.



* He was thought to have been poisoned. However that was a common suspicion in Roman courts even for purely medical cases.
