Speaking from personal experience I can say that 'OK' doesn't catch the complexities. On [State of Decay](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/state-of-decay) most of the team were pretty hard-core zombie fans and the game itself was pretty gory -- but most of us are parents as well. We talked it over about a month into the project and none of us -- despite our splatter-filled credentials --- was comfortable shooting at kids. 

 We never even considered what the ESRB would do*; none of us wanted to spend the next couple of years watching all of the things that simulated guns and simulated physics could do to little people. It's entirely irrational, logically indefensible, and basically hypocritical: in a word, instinctive. In our twenty person team there was not even a murmur of dissent, it was a spontaneous and unanimous decision despite its obvious inconsitencies. 

So "OK" as in "you won't go to jail?" Yes, you won't go to jail. "OK" as in "likely to be a commercial success?": No. It'll get some free faux-controversy marketing, like Postal or Carmageddon; but if a room full of people who made this:

and this:

 find it distasteful, there's really not much of a market. 

* In any event a game featuring realistic violence done to 14 year olds would very likely not be purchasable by 14 year olds in the US, the UK, Germany or Australia and I'd expect similar results elsewhere.
