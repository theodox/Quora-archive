The oldest bilingual dictionaries are [Akkadian->Sumerian wordlists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_lists) from Mesopotamia.

During the third millennium BC, the language of everday life in Mesoptamia switched from Sumerian to Akkadian. But since the religious and literary tradition was exclusively Sumerian, Akkadian scribes concocted word lists to help them understand the Sumerian vocabulary of their “classic” texts.

This is a fairly late example from the seventh century BC; the oldest examples are about two thousand years older.
