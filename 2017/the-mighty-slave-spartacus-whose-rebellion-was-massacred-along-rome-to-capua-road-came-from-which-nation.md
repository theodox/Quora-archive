Spartacus (more likely _Sparadokos_ ) was a [Thracian.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thracians)

Thrace in this period covered southern Bulgaria, the eastern part of the Republic of Macedonia, and European Turkey.

_A Thracian coin for a king named Sparadokos (readinc clockwise from top)_ 

The name Sparadokos shows up in several Thracian kingdoms in the Balkans and the Crimea; itâ€™s not clear if Spartacus the gladiator bore that name himself or if he was given the name by a master who had heard of the royal name. He had served as a mercenary or a Roman auxiliary soldier.
