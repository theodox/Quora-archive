# If the Greeks called themselves "Romans" during the Eastern Roman rule, why did they not call themselves as "Athenian", "Spartan", "Macedonian" but "Greek" in general during the Classical age?

Ah— but they did. Referring to yourself and others by the name of your native city was the ordinary usage.

“Hellene” as an ethonym generally shows up in contexts where the contrasts between the fuzzy-but-I-know-it-when-I-see-it Greek community is contrasted against a non-Greek other. At least, that’s how it works in our sources, which are lopsidedly influenced by the culture of Athens, which rose to prominence on the strength of opposition to the Persians, and the culture of Alexandria, which was a colonial enclave ruling over a foreign population of Egyptians and Jews.

In almost any other context a Greek speaker would identify with their native city, and would regard other Greeks as “foreigners” (it was, for example, almost impossible for a Greek from any other city to become an Athenian or a Spartan citizen).
