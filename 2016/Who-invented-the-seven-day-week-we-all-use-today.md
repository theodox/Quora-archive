It actually reflects the merging of two different traditions, both of which go back to Mesopotamia.

__Mesopotamian origins__ 

There’s some evidence for seven days being a significant interval as far back as the ‘Sumerian Renaissance’ period: some people see the sequence of rooms in [Gudea’s Temple](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.2.1.7#) as a reference to a ‘week’ of seven days but it’s not clear.

The Babylonians however definitely used a seven-day cycle for some purposes, with the seventh day as a ritually-impure day (an ‘evil’ day, they would have said) when certain kinds of activities were forbidden. They didn’t use weeks exactly since they added extra days to the 4th week of a month to keep the weeks in sync with the moon, so their months would be 7–7–7–8 or 7–7–7–9 days long.

The seven-day week also features prominently in the Hebrew scriptures, but in Hebrew the days don’t have names: they are merely numbered. The seven-day week was in use by Jews no later than 600 BCE and probably a few centuries before that. However it’s only indirectly the basis for the European seven-day week.

__Adoption in the west__ 

The [Greek Calendar](http://www.polysyllabic.com/?q=calhistory/earlier/greek) was a mess in a number of ways, and among them was the lack of weeks. They used (roughly) three ten-day weeks to divide up their (roughly) 30-day months but both were “[flexible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_calendar#Days_of_the_month).”

The old Roman Republican calendar was somewhat similar (and similarly messy). It had even more obvious fixation on the waning and waxing of the moon rather than a set count of days in a week — the ‘‘Kalends’ (new moon) and ‘Ides’ (full moon) which have perplexed generations of Latin students were the temporal landmarks they cared about. There was also an 8-day market cycle known as the ‘nundinal’ or nine-day cycle* which filled something like the same job as a week and, like a week, didn’t line up neatly with the lunar calendar.

_The_ _[Fasti Antiates Maiores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasti_Antiates_Maiores)_ _, an official Roman calendar from about 60 BC, shows the months (columns) and the 8-day nundinal cycle (letters A-H, repeating in the left-most position of each column)._ 

Our seven-day week first shows up for certain in Rome around the first century, and over the next couple of centuries it edged out the Kalends/Ides and the _nundinae_ . Greek and Roman astronomers [borrowed the Babylonian tradition](https://www.quora.com/Were-the-planets-named-after-Greek-Roman-gods-or-did-the-ancients-believe-the-planets-were-gods/answer/Steve-Theodore) associating the planets with particular deities and it’s worth pointing out that the seven day-deities are the seven heavenly bodies visible to the naked eye: Here’s how they line up in Latin and English:

_dies Saturnis_ , Saturday = Saturn
_dies Solis_ , Sunday = the sun
_dies Lunae,_  Monday = the moon
_dies Martis_ , Tuesday = Mars (Tiw was the old-English war god)
_dies Mecurii_ , Wednesday = Mercury (Somehow Wotan got mixed up with Mercury in English)
_dies Jovis_ , Thursday = Jupiter (Thor, like Jove/Jupiter/Zeus, has thunderbolts)
_dies Veneris_ , Friday = Venus (Freya or Frig is the old English love goddess)

_This calendar from the baths of Trajan (some time after 100 CE) shows pegs for seven days across the top, under pictures of Saturn, Sol, Luna, Mars Mercury, Jove, Venus — our Saturday, Sunday, Monday, etc._ 

Astrology in many forms was a very important part of the Roman outlook from the first through the fifth or sixth centuries. It could look quasi-scientific, in medicine or astronomy — or it could be the basis of folk magic. In either case the association of ‘the seven planets’ with the days (and the zodiac signs with the months) was an important part of ordinary people’s thinking about time. That’s probably the real driver of the shift to the seven-day week. It seems to have been a bottom-up social development rather than a government edict.

__Formalization__ 

The spread of Judaism and then Christianity also accelerated the adoption of a single seven-day cycle. The first century the Jewish historian Josephus describes non-Jews adopting Sabbath observances and customs, and the Roman satirist Juvenal makes fun of Romans who “give up every seventh day to idleness” in imitation of the Jews. The idea of a seventh day which was different than the other six probably does come from Judaism, although it’s sometimes suggested it was also present in Mithraism.

In addition to legalizing Christianity, emperor Constantine cemented the seven-day week into law in 321, when he issued an order forbidding public business and commerce (but not, interestingly, agricultural labor) on _venerabili die solis,_ “the revered day of the sun”_—_ an interesting mix of the Judeo-Christian day of rest with a Babylonian astronomical observance. Over the next couple of centuries subsequent emperors would make the explicit connection of _dies solis_  with “the Lord’s day” and lay the foundation for the European week as we know it today.



_* the nundinal cycle contains 8 days but is 9 days long - an ambiguity which a lot of us still run into when we say something happens “a week from today” but really mean “8 days from now”._
