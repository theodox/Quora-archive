The short answer is “we don’t really know,” but the most answer is a mix of population movements and changes at the top.

Semitic Akkadian names start showing up about 500 years after the Sumerians started writing things down — so, roughly the 25th century BC and more than a century before the first explicitly “Akkadian” polity, which began with the conquests of [Sargon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad) around the end of the 24th century BC.

Although the stories are about Sargon pretty confusing, he seems to have been well connected in some way: in one version he was raised as a palace gardener. In another, he was the comrade in arms of [Lugal-zage-si](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugal-zage-si), a warlike lugal of Umma who united all of Sumeria into one state for the first time. Either version suggests that the Akkadian speakers were already integrated into Sumerian life in important ways. It seems like both languages borrowed from each other, in the way Balkan languages often do even when they come from very distinct language families — that suggests a ‘side-by-side’ lifestyle rather than a sudden demographic change.

Sargon’s empire began the practice of writing Akkadian in cuneiform, but Sumerian continued in use alongside it. The Sargonid empire fell to the [Gutians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutian_dynasty_of_Sumer) around 2130 BC, and they ruled for about a century over both Akkadian and Sumerian speakers. There was a brief [Sumerian renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Dynasty_of_Ur) when the Gutians were driven out by [Utu-hengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utu-hengal), but it’s not clear if the resurgence of Sumerian texts at that time reflects a re-assertion of Sumerian culture, or just an economic recovery from the troubled times of the Gutian dominion. In any case, the “renaissance” ended with more invasions after about 2000 BC: the Elamites from the south and the [Amorites ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorites)from the north carved up Mesoptamia between them, and Sumeria was never again ruled by ethnic Sumerians.

Since the Amorites were Semitic speakers — although from a different branch of the Semitic language family — their presence in Mesopotamia probably enhanced the relative prestige of Akkadian. Still, it took two or three centuries after the end of Sumerian independence for the language to be relegated entirely to religious, medical and antiquarian use.

It’s hard to know how much of the change reflects political power, how much reflects demographic replacement (the Amorites, in particular, moved as a nation: they were desert nomads before settling down in Mesopotamia) and how much reflects social trends or even accidents of transmission.
