Robert Harris' Cicero series:  [Imperium](http://amzn.to/1Z6l2Zp) and [Conspirata](http://amzn.to/1JuNpPi) are pretty good and stick fairly close to the times. The upcoming [Dictator. ](http://amzn.to/1JuNtP4)which comes out this month I think, will bring the events up to Caesar's dictatorship. His [Pompeii ](http://amzn.to/1Z6lJBZ)didn't work as well for me but is still not a bad read.

[Steven Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series](http://amzn.to/1Z6lUxh) is a sort of Dashiell Hammet in Rome detective noir; it's set in roughly the same time period, covering the end of the Republic.

[Lindsey Davis' Didius Falco series ](http://amzn.to/1Z6mhb8) is also a detective novel, set in the Flavian period so about a hundred years later than Harris and Saylor. It's less noirish in tone, but good research. I haven't read her [Flavia Albia books,](http://www.amazon.com/Ides-April-Flavia-Albia-Mystery-ebook/dp/B009LRWU7O/ref=la_B000AQ6YE0_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1452115069&sr=1-2) which are set one generation later and have a female heroine, but if they are up to her usual standard they'd be worth checking out.

Colleen McCullough's [Masters of Rome series ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B00CJL7M2W/ref=dp_st_0061582425)covers the same well-trodden ground around the last generation of the Republic, but it also covers a generation earlier in the time of Marius and Sulla. It's a bit operatic for my taste but it's a popular series.

Robert Grave's [I, Claudius](http://amzn.to/1JuPlai)  [ ](http://www.amazon.com/Claudius-Autobiography-Tiberius-Murdered-International/dp/067972477X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1452115788&sr=8-2&keywords=i+claudius)and [Claudius the God](http://amzn.to/1Z6osvp)  are great if you want a tabloid approach to Roman corruption and debauchery. His [Count Belisarius](http://amzn.to/1Z6oOlD) takes an equally graphic look at Justinian's reconquest of Italy in the 6th century. The same events are chronicled in a light-hearted time travel context in Sprague DeCamp's novella [Lest Darkness Fall.](http://amzn.to/1Z6p8Re) 

Iain Pears' [Dream of Scipio ](http://amzn.to/1TF7P8y)is a rare look at the "decline and fall" period, bracketed with a modern tale in Vichy France.
