Lots of great answers here... which is to be expected since anything as successful as Minecraft has to hit a lot of chords to be so successful: these explanations are far from mutually exclusive. 

I'd add one humbler reason - one that has served Minecraft very well compared to other projects (Project Spark, for example, and EQ Next) . It's the forgiveness factor of Minecraft's graphics. Minecraft is always compared to Legos as a brilliant example of a generative toy - a stimulus to the imagination and a chance for people to express themselves creatively. A lot of this, I think, stems from the fact that the ceiling in both media is _low:_ if you set out to create a realistic model of something in Minecraft or Legos you're never really going to get very close -- and everybody knows it. When you come across a Lego Mt. Rushmore, or a Minecraft Eiffel tower you think 'wow, how clever!' or 'somebody really put in a lot of work.' If you have any appreciation of how Minecraft works you _don't_  say "How come that Eiffel tower is made of huge cubes?" or "That thing looks like a MacPaint picture from 1989." 

 Minecraft forcibly diminishes the gap between what the pros and the amateurs can accomplish -- and in the process, makes things a lot more fun for the amateurs. If it were a more flexible and faithful visual medium it would come to be dominated by the same kinds of perfectionist graphics you see everywhere else in games. The clunky forms, goofy animations and huge pixels give everybody who plays the freedom to mess around and build things without the artistic anxieties (and often the tedious detail work) that come with better visuals. 

That's an important factor in liberating all of the other kinds of creativity that you see in Minecraft -- if you have a fun idea for a mod or minigame you don't have to put in lots of hi-fidelity graphic work just to attract people's attention or prove your bona-fides. And even if you're just hacking around on something to show your friend, the general level of unavoidable goofiness means you need fear no judgements.

In short, Minecraft is to digital art and game design what Karaoke (and liquor!) is to music: it's license to loosen up and have some fun even if you're not a superstar.
