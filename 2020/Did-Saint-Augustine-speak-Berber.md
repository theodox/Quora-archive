He grew up in a mixed Punic/Latin context and he was able to at least understand Punic. Augustine’s writings are often used by scholars studying the linguistic landscape of late-Roman Africa; the famous quote is:

> _Unde interrogati rustici nostri, quid sint, punice respondentes: "Chanani" -- corrupta scilicet, sicut in talibus solet, una littera, quid aliud respondent quam "Chananaei?"_ 
__ When our rural peasants are asked what they are, they reply, in Punic, _"Chanani,"_  which is only a corruption by one letter, what else should they respond but "Chananaei?"

Where of course _Chananaei_ means _Canaanites._ So where he grew up (in [Thagaste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thagaste)) the local language culture was Latin in the cities and Punic in the countryside — Augustine also speaks of the difficulty of finding Punic-speaking bishops for rural areas.

That of course does not mean those _Chananaei_ were all direct descendants of Punic colonists, any more than Greek islanders were Italian _[Romaoi](https://www.quora.com/Was-there-really-an-isolated-island-in-Greece-that-thought-it-was-still-under-Roman-occupation-until-the-1820s/answer/Diptarka-Hait?ch=10&share=d1ee03e4&srid=zLvM)_ __ into the 20th century. It’s more than likely that the majority of their ancestors were Numidians, or what Latin speakers of Augustine’s days would have called Libyans*. There are [Libyan inscriptions in the neighborhood of Thagaste ](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Written_Culture_in_a_Colonial_Context/bd0yAQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=stele+cheffia&pg=PA10&printsec=frontcover)though the closest one in time is about two centuries before Augustine. In other parts of Roman Africa you see Latin-Berber bilingual inscriptions in the same period.

Most people, of course, don’t leave inscriptions. It’s likely that there was a lot more multi-lingualism than our records show. Augustine’s own family shows how complex the situation was: his mother, [St. Monica](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10482a.htm), inherited name from the Libyan goddess Mon, though her parents were Christian. Augustine and his brother Navigius had eminently Latin names (perhaps reflecting their local prominence: Augustine’s father was a local landowner with social ambitions). This [list of North African names](http://www.punic.co.uk/phoenician/latnames/latnames.html) gives a good flavor for the mix of Latin, Punic and Libyan, often within the same person’s name or family.

Augustine and other Latin-writing churchmen in this period did make use of Punic to help understand the Hebrew scriptures, or sometimes just to reach their audiences: Augustine’s predecessor in Hippo used the sound similarity between _salus_ , “wellbeing” in Latin and _salush, “three”_ in Punic as an argument for the Trinity. Augustine himself explains a few Biblical words from Hebrew or Aramaic by reference to Punic: for example

> Now “Messias” is Anointed: Anointed, in Greek, is Christ; in Hebrew, Messias; whence also, in Punic, Messe means Anoint. For the Hebrew, Punic and Syriac are cognate and neighboring languages.



Our sources in this period use “Libyan” for “native language(s) of North Africa that are not Latin or Punic” — they don’t distinguish between the various varieties of Berber stretching from Egypt to the Atlantic.
