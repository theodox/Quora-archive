The linked article suggests that [the well known map prepared in 1602](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunyu_Wanguo_Quantu) by the Jesuit missionary [Matteo Ricci](http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/sj/scientists/ricci.htm) is actually a copy of a Chinese map produced by the Ming admiral [Zheng He.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_He)

This is impossible for a number of reasons.

The most obvious one being the obvious futility of presenting the emperor of China with a copy of a Chinese map that is not even particularly precise about the political geography of Europe — surely a scholar like Ricci, whose entire approach to China was based on intellectual engagement with Chinese culture, would not bother to indulge in such an obvious, easily detectable hoax.

Zheng He’s fleet definitely sailed the east coast of Africa, and perhaps reached as far as the Cape of Good Hope. However no Chinese or other source ever mentions anything like a voyage across the Atlantic or rounding Cape Horn into the Pacific. In our timeline it took nearly a hundred years of exploration (beginning with [Henry the Navigator ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Henry_the_Navigator)around the same time as Zheng He) before a successful circumnavigation of the earth — for Zheng He to have produced a reasonably good map of the Americas in the 1430’s all of the following would have to be true:

Zheng He’s expeditions sailed in large fleets of dozens of ships. These would have had to have sailed up the west coast of Africa and right past Spain, Portugal, France and England __without being noticed.__ They certainly caused a stir in Arabia, India, and Ceylon — why not Lisbon or London?

The first large-scale ocean exploration in Chinese history would have had to successfully circumnavigate the earth. Inevitably they would have either gained or lost a day, as Magellan’s crew found out when they returned to Europe. But then for some reason they’d __not mention either of these two very striking facts.__ 

__They deliberately leave out the rest of the world__  from [the maps they did publish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_He#Modern_scholarship), and only published the parts which covered areas they reported having visited. No other map published in China included the Americas from the 1430’s to the 1610’s.

They’d visit the Americas __without bringing back a single example of New World art or New World animals__ . No buffalo? No electric eels? No Aztec statues? Or most of all, no South American gold, silver or jade?

__They’d have to sail really, really, really fast.__ Magellan’s 1519-1521 expedition sailed about 38,000 miles with very few stops and took two years. The longest of Zheng He’s recorded voyages took about the same time, but all of his trips involved diplomacy and trade and on a couple of occasions, warfare. For him to have produced a map with even passable representations of the Americas, he’d have had to sail from the tip of Africa to the North Atlantic, then back to Cape Horn, then back to Alaska — a route comparable to entirety of Magellan’s trip. (Even on a straight line it’s 8500 miles from Iceland to Tierra del Fuego, and Zheng He would have had to sail from South Africa to Iceland then back to Tierra Del Fuego and then back to Alaska, and the straight line is only a fraction of the distance you’d need to map the coasts.) Surveying all the coasts in that map would probably double Magellan’s 38,000 mile trip — at a decent pre-modern speed of 5 knots (faster than Columbus’s average of 4) that trip would take almost two years _without ever stopping once._ Including stops for water, repair, and restocking it would almost certainly require three years — Captain Cook’s first voyage (which skipped most of western North America and all of east Asia) took that long. Zheng He’s monument states that in his voyages he sailed over 100,000 _li,_ which would a bit over 31,000 miles. But to cover both coasts of Africa and the Americas would be at least __300,000__ ___li.___ Why not use the proper number?

The 1602 map show the course of the St. Lawrence, Mississippi, and Amazon rivers — how quickly could those have been mapped? It took Cartier __six months__ to sail up the St. Lawrence and back — and he only got as far a Montreal. Yet those cartographers who did such a great job on the Amazon completely missed the existence of the Columbia river on the west coast of the Americas — which, incidentally, didn’t show up on western maps until 1775. How many six-month river expeditions could Zheng He have done in a two-year circumnavigations?

For some reason the Chinese cartographers decided to__place the__ __[prime meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian)__ __in the Cape Verde islands__  — right where the Roman-era geographer Ptolemy placed it so he would not have to use negative numbers to describe east-west differences in his map of the Mediterranean. Today it runs through Greenwich, England thanks to a bunch of English map-makers. But why would the Chinese of 1403 put it there?

TLDR: It’s a European global map representing the state of the world around 1600 ( the map includes labels like “land of wild horses” for the great Plains — where horses were only introduced to North America in the early 1500’s).

It certainly includes knowledge taken from Chinese maps of east Asia which of course were better their European counterparts. It does not, however, show that Zheng He did sailed around the world or visited the Americas or somehow crammed dozens of discoveries which took place over two centuries into a single lifetime.
