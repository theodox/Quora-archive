In adding to [Natalia Hudelson](https://www.quora.com/profile/Natalia-Hudelson)'s excellent answer I'd just add that the later 'Hellas' and 'Hellene' derive from Ἕλλην, mythologically a son of Deucalion (the "Greek Noah"). His children -- [Aeolus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolus), [Xuthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuthus), and [Dorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorus) -- were the founders of the big Greek linguistic groupings: the Aeolian, Dorian and, through Xuthus, the Ionian and Achaean branches; the emphasis was always on the ethnic and linguistic community not on the place: toponyms for cities as smaller regions abound but there was no 'Greece', only the 'Greek speaking world'.

As for place names, several recognizable names do come through the Linear B corpus. Here's a [handy map](https://linearbknossosmycenae.wordpress.com/2014/09/28/a-map-of-the-mycenaean-empire-ca-1600-1200-bce-with-major-locales-attested-a-derived-d-named-in-linear-b-for-the-first-time/) for mainland Greece. Important ones that are attested include Tiryns (Turo), Pylos (Puro) Orchomenos (Orokomeno) and Zakynthos (Zakuro).

__Caveat__ : I assume the author has the attestation part right - but I'm less sure about the derivations since one of them ("Akio iria" is derived from 'Agios Ilias" -- aka Saint Elias -- so it's, er, _unlikely?_  to be Mycenaean. He also lists Mukene (Mycenae) but I remember reading elsewhere that is not directly attested in Linear B -- however without references its hard to be sure. The link may have more details that prove my suspicions wrong.
