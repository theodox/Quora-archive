Nope, no connection. As it happens, Caesar (with a C) suffered from seizures (with an s) because he was an epileptic.

However, linguistically the English word comes ultimately from the French _seizir,_ “to claim” or “to have the use of”, which itself goes back to a Medieval Latin word of uncertain origin. In Medieval Latin, however, “Caesar” would have been pronounced with a hard K- sound in northern Europe and a Ch- sound in southern Europe — the English pronunciation “see-zar” is close to “seizir” but not to how Medieval people would name old Julius C.
