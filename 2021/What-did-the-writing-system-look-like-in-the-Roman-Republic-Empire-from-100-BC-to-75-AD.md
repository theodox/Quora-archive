Well there are really quite a few.

The Latin alphabet in this period is pretty familiar:

_A section of the_ [Res Gestae Divi Augusti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_Gestae_Divi_Augusti)_, emperor Augustus’s personal testament. This copy was inscribed in what’s now Turkey in 14 AD._ 

Of course most people don’t carve their messages in stone. The Romans didn’t have paper; instead they used [papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus), a writing surface made from strips of Egyptian sedge leaves. While it was cheap and widely available, it wasn’t always very high quality, which encouraged sloppy handwriting in a lot of cases. Ordinary Latin written on papyrus with a reed pen it would look more like this:

If you look really carefully you can make out most of this sample from around 54 AD… but even the Romans found it hard to read casual handwriting:

> __Pseudolus__ : In my opinion, these letters are seeking children for themselves: one mounts the other.

> __Calidorus__ : Are you mocking me with your teasing?

> __Pseudolus__ : Indeed, by Pollux I believe that unless the Sibyl can read these letters, nobody else can understand them.

Plautus, [Pseudolus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudolus)

In ordinary life the most common writing material wasn’t papyrus - it was wax. A wooden tablet with a wax inlay was a reusable note-pad for daily business:

The other common writing material was [parchment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchment#History) — that is, treated animal skins. Parchment was a prestige material, and very expensive. Well prepared parchment can last a thousand years or more, where papyrus rarely survives more than a century or two in a humid climate. [That’s why our ancient texts are late-Roman or Byzantine copies, not originals.](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-scholars-use-Greek-sources-like-Homer-and-Herodotus-when-studying-ancient-history-even-though-not-a-single-manuscript-has-been-found-that-was-actually-written-by-them/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=342e2b4a&srid=zLvM)



The Roman empire was extremely diverse and very multilingual — at this point in time there were probably more than a hundred spoken languages within the empire. In the first century you could still find people in Italy who spoke [Oscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscan_language), [Umbrian, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrian_language)or [Etruscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_language). The first two were written in Latin characters by this point, but Etruscan had a distinctive alphabet:

_This Etruscan tablet is a bit older than the period in the question, but it’s clearer than a lot of other examples. The use of inscribed bronze sheets like this for permanent record keeping was a common feature in this era; unfortunately most of them were recycled in the last 2000 years._ 

In northern Italy the [Venetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetic_language#:~:text=Venetic%20is%20an%20extinct%20Indo,southern%20fringe%20of%20the%20Alps.) language (which used an alphabet derived from Etruscan) was rapidly dying out in this period. Farther north and east — in what’s now Austria — the [Rhaetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhaetian_language) alphabet also derived from Etruscan.

Right around this time one of these Etruscan-derived scripts was being adopted by German and Celtic speakers outside the empire, where it became [Elder Futhark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Futhark) — more popularly known as the Runic alphabet. But it wouldn’t become widespread until the second century.

In most of the eastern and southern parts of the empire Greek was more common than Latin. The inscribed form is quite similar to modern Greek fonts

_Another inscription from Turkey — the last half of “Caesar” ΚΑΙΣΑΡ and “Augustus” ΣΕΒΑΣΤΟΣ “emperor” ΑΥΤΟΚΡΑΤΟΡ._ 

The more informal form, as with Latin, was a bit harder to decipher:

_A rare example of a bit of ancient information technology: a mummy tag from Roman Egypt. This side is inscribed in Greek, the reverse in Demotic Egyptian. Photo:_ _[Crews Project](https://crewsproject.wordpress.com/2018/03/17/crews-display-a-bilingual-mummy-label/)_ 

Greek served a _lingua franca_ and the language of record for many other communities — dozens of smaller language groups used Greek for business and recordkeeping while speaking a their own languages at home. For example here’s a coin from the Roman client kingdom of the Bosporus: it’s inscribed in Greek but on behalf of king [Rhescuporis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Julius_Rhescuporis_I)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bd9376b6b469af03ea60f68b95443d78)

and this one is for King [Amyntas of Galatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyntas_of_Galatia), in modern Turkey. Galatia was inhabited by the descendants of Celtic invaders; their distant cousins in Gaul (modern France) also typically minted their coins in Greek in the first century BC but began switching to the Latin alphabet after Caesar’s conquest.

For all it’s success, though, Greek was a relative newcomer — Egypt and the near east had been literate for thousands of years and had their own writing traditions.

The mummy tag above comes from Egypt, which is where we find most of our examples of how ordinary people (rather than government stone-masons) wrote: the dry climate preserves bits of writing that we don’t have in for anywhere in Europe. There’s no surviving papyrus in Europe from the first century BC or AD, unless you count some carbonized scrolls from Pompeii. The Egyptian sands on the other hand preserve a lot of Greek and Egyptian texts; only the Dead Sea Scrolls (from the Judaean desert) yield papyrus in similar states of preservation.

The Egyptian writing of this period is usually in [Demotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)) or [Hieratic. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieratic)By this period hieroglyphs were really only used for writing an older, fossilized version of the Egyptian language which had little to do with daily life. This period also sees the emergence of what would eventually be the modern [Coptic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_alphabet) — a modified version of the Greek alphabet (with a few signs borrowed from Demotic) used to write Egyptian. Coptic would become the sole writing system in Egypt over the next four hundred years or so.

_Top left, Hieratic. Top right, Demotic. Bottom, Coptic (this example is probably around the 3d century AD however). If you count Hieroglyphics, in this period Egyptian was written in four distinct scripts._ 

To the east of Egypt, the dominant (but far from the only) script was [Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic). The Aramaic script (grandfather to modern Hebrew, Arabic, Kharosthi, and Pahlavi among many others). Aramaic was the language of international commerce from Canaan to Afghanistan. Aramaic comes in too many local flavors to list, though these were different “fonts” rather than different alphabets.

The Romans had only recently acquired territory in what’s now Jordan and the Sinai peninsula, the home of the [Nabataean alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabataean_alphabet) — a descendant of Aramaic that would go on to become the basis for Arabic.

In this period the [Phoenician language and script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_language) were rapidly declining in their Lebanese homeland, where Aramaic and Greek were pushing them aside. However far to the west, in North Africa, the ancient Phoenician colonies would hang on for some hundreds of years as both a written and a spoken tongue: St. Augustine, a native of what’s today Algeria, grew up speaking a descendant of Phoenician (we usually distinguish this western version as “Punic”. Here’s a Punic-Latin bilingual inscription of the first century from [Leptis Magna, today’s Khoms, Libya.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptis_Magna)

Also in North Africa the Numidians and Libyans — ancestors of today’s Berbers — had their own alphabet. It’s ancestral to modern [Tifinagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifinagh#Origins).

After all that, I’ve probably left out one or two of the more obscure writing systems of the time. But there’s a reason they are obscure: this period saw the political unification of the entire Mediterranean world for the first time in history. It created a tremendous upsurge in economic and cultural activity — and also, like modern globalization, tended to smother a lot of local cultures in the embrace of the larger language communities. Even though many spoken languages remained vibrant right through the Roman period, within a few hundred years Greek, Latin, and Aramaic would crowd out most of the smaller scripts.
