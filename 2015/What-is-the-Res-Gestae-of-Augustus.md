Translation here: [The Internet Classics Archive](http://classics.mit.edu/Augustus/deeds.html).

One interesting side note: the [Monumentum Ancyranum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monumentum_Ancyranum) is the main source for this text: it's the most intact copy of only a handful of survivors -- but the _res gestae_  was inscribed on imperial temples all up and down the empire. It's amazing how an officially promulgated document, designed to be seen everywhere survived intact in only one out-of-the-way ruin. Says something about how much has been lost in the intervening centuries.
