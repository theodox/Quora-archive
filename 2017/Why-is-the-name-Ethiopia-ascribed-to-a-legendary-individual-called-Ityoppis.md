The usual etymology is from the Greek _Ethiops_ , which means “burnt face” — it was just the vague geographical term for the “land of the darker-skinned people”, and in very early Greek sources it could mean both Africa below the borders of Egypt and also India.

In the [Book of Aksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Aksum), a 15th century Ethiopian text, the creation of the first Axumite city is ascribed to someone named Itiyopp'is, supposedly a son of [Cush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cush_(Bible)), who was a grandson of Noah. The connection of Biblical Cush with the [Kingdom of Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush) is very old an widespread; it seems like the Ethiopian authors of the Book of Aksum borrowed the old Greek habit of assigning national names to legendary individuals and created an “Itiyopp'is” to explain the name which outsiders used for their kingdom. A thousand years before, it’s likely that an educated Axumite would have recognized the Greek etymology, but since Ethiopia had been cut off from contact with Greek speakers for most of the intervening millennium they seem to have assumed that _Ethiops_  was a proper name rather than an adjective.
