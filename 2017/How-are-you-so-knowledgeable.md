OK, [Habib](https://www.quora.com/profile/Habib-157), I’ll answer this one ‘cause you flatter me.

I’d say it’s not really about being knowledgeable, it’s just the combination of two vices:

__Vanity.__ I was the kind of kid who attracts nicknames like “the little professor” — a posture .I have been amply repaid for by my own children, who have inherited it in spades. If I knew then what I know now…. But my particular version of this vice manifests itself in fear of being caught out in a whopper. I’m very reluctant to just dash something off without double checking my memory through the magic of the interwebs (or, more rarely, the dusty fragments of the Loeb’s Classics Library in the basement). I never stoop to googling during a bar argument; but when nobody’s looking, anything goes. This creates an illusion of domain knowledge — but if I had to answer questions in real time it’s be quickly dispelled.

__Zeligism__ , I do have a decent knack for _sounding_ like I know stuff. A high school English teacher — bless her trusting heart— once told me I was “wise beyond my years” thanks mostly to my talent for sounding like T.S. Eliot on demand (another great faker, btw, writing as musty old Prufrock when he was in his early twenties). Any knowledge of my high school dating career would have decisively disproved that thesis but my posturings did set a pattern I’ve followed ever since: I just [copy the rhythms and music of other peoples’ writing well enough to pass](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-tips-to-write-like-Samuel-Johnson-the-Dr-Johnson-of-the-18th-century/answer/Steve-Theodore), at least if you squint. Plus, a taste for classics tends to polish up your Cambridge Don imitation to a high gloss by sheer friction.
