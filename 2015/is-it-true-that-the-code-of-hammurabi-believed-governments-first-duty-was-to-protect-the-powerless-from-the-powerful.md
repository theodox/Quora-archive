[User-10661484422791150723](https://www.quora.com/profile/User-10661484422791150723)'s answer is right, the law definitely did enshrine social class as a legal category.

 However, it's also true that written laws were fundamentally more important for the less powerful. In Athens, for example, we know that the nobility fought hard against the introduction of written laws. Written laws are publicly available for all to consult, instead of a semi-secret product of an aristocratic oral tradition.

Also, fixed punishments (even the ones that seem pretty barbaric to us) set the limits of acceptable return for injuries. The "eye-for-an-eye" code limits reciprocal violence between families or clans . Without that limitation, the powerful (who in those days would have access to armed supporters) could easily overawe those without powerful backers. Imposing any punishment at all on wealthier criminals is progressive. You'll not that the code distinguishes by the class of the victim, but not that of the offender. 

In most Mesopotamian cultures, kings tried to pose as protectors of the weak against the strong. While the poor were not considered equal to the rich, they were very numerous: the kings, by protecting them against the wealthy (particularly through the law courts) gained support against potential competitors and legitimized their own power. The decrees of [Urukagina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urukagina), much older than Hammurabi, do include some social welfare provisions like support payments for the disabled and widows. Hammurabi's code included minimum wage laws and guarantees of payment for services.

All that noted, the "first duty of government" in Mesopotamian cultures was usually understood as service to the gods, rather than to people. Hammurabi did write

_“I am indeed the shepherd who brings peace, whose scepter is just._ 
_My benevolent shade was spread over my city, I held the people of the lands of Sumer and Akkad safely on my lap.”_ 

He was the shepherd, the people the the flock - but the gods owned the farm.
