Hieroglyphs were actually deciphered in the 1820’s , when the French scholar [Jean-François Champollion](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/champollion_jean.shtml) finally cracked the puzzle.

_Champollion, the great detective_ 

The _language_ of the hieroglyphs is actually still a living language, more or less: [Coptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language) is the religious language of Egypt’s native Christian minority, and is the direct descendant of the language of the Pharaohs. For about a thousand years various Arab and European scholars guessed that — but they never managed to work out the complex way in which the language was written down.

The key to the mystery was the [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) — a bilingual inscription in hieroglyphic and ancient Greek — which was found by a soldier attached to Napoleon’s failed invasion of Egypt in 1799. Champollion correctly guessed that some of the words which where ‘highlighted’ in the hieroglyphic text corresponded to the names of the Greek king Ptolemy and queen Cleopatra.* This allowed him to swap in more or less correct phonetic values for some of the glyphs (and to prove that the hieroglyphs were mostly syllabic) and formed the basis for further readings.

_Champollion guessed, rightly, that the hieroglyphic enclosed in rings like these were proper names. That led him to start establishing the phonetic values of the sign._ 

As for why it took so long…

Hieroglyphs were never a common writing system. They were reserved for legal and religious documents, and so they were really only directed at a professional audience of trained scribes and priests.

There were two other, more popular writing systems in ancient Egypt: [Hieratic,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieratic) a simplified version of the hieroglyphs used by priests and scribes, and [Demotic ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian))which was used for business and personal dealings. Most literate Egyptians — literate people were in the minority anyway — used Demotic rather than hieroglyphs or Hieratic script; you can imagine it sort of like 19th century Europe where states and churches used Latin for formal occasions, but most people only knew their native tongue.

So, hieroglyphic writing never had a deep hold on most Egyptians — it was an affair for the highly educated elite.

_This is how most Egyptians actually wrote: a pre-nup written in Demotic_ 

On top of all that, Egypt was ruled by Greeks and Romans for almost a thousand years. Greek became the language of law and business, and so Greek script displaced demotic and hieratic for ordinary business. The modern Coptic alphabet is based on Greek, to most people it looks like Greek or Russian. Thus, ordinary Egyptians lost touch with the hieroglyphic texts — it wasn’t how they wrote for themselves.

The last writing in hieroglyphis is a brief temple inscription from the year 394, but there were very few in the century or two before that. It’s clear from Greek writings about Egypt in the first century that a lot of what we can now read in hieroglyphics was already pretty garbled in the popular imagination. It didn’t help that Egypt was also of the earliest and most enthusiastically Christianized parts of the Roman world. This meant that the temples — which were the main users of hieroglyphics — were shrinking and the traditions which sustained the writing system decayed.

Egyptian — that is, Coptic — was still the language of daily life in Egypt until the 1600′s when it was finally submerged under Arabic; but just as Greek characters had replaced demotic in daily life, Arabic writing replaced Coptic for many practical purposes.

There is only one ancient text which claims** first-hand knowledge of the hieroglyphs — the catalogue of [Horapollo](http://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/hh/index.htm), from the 600’s — and it’s fully of mistakes and guesswork although there are a few nuggets of genuine fact as well. Even though many scholars and would -be decipherers down the years suspected that Coptic was the key to understanding the hieroglyphic texts, Horapollo and a lot of other mystical texts which claimed to interpret the hieroglyphs confused the issue enormously. It took a boring bilingual text like the Rosetta stone —- which is about as exciting to read as the minutes of a local Rotary club meeting — to finally unravel the mystery.

_A Renaissance copy of Horapollo. This page explains that the Egyptians used either a sun and a moon, or a snake curled over it’s own tail to symbolize ‘eternity’. Unfortunately this is_ _[garbled at best](https://therealsamizdat.com/2016/05/29/eco-the-egyptian-alphabet-2/)_ _. Horapollo’s mix of guesswork and authentic bits of hieroglyphic tradition muddied the waters for centuries._

** Opinion is divided on how genuine Horapallo really was; Some think he’s just a made-up identity assumed by a Greek writer. In either case, his information is of very mixed quality and doesn’t do much to teach the would-be student how to actually read a hieroglyphic text.
