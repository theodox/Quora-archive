Roman equipment and tactics in the age of the kings and the first century and half or so of the Republic were [close enough to contemporary Greek gear that a modern person would probably confuse them](https://www.quora.com/What-did-Roman-soldiers-look-like-when-it-was-still-a-kingdom/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=c6566b00&srid=zLvM). Most of Rome’s neighbors, particularly the Etruscans, were also outfitted the same way. You could probably slip a Roman from the year 480 into the Greek ranks at Thermopylae without being noticed right away.

Italian tactics and equipment started changing during the 4th c BC during Roman wars against people like the Samnites where rugged terrain and a more mobile fighting style encourage the Romans to drop the closer-order Greek style of phalanx fighting, eventually culminating in what’s known as the [manipular legion ](https://www.realmofhistory.com/2016/06/20/animation-roman-maniple-warfare-superb-visual/)— the distinctive tactics which won the Punic Wars and beat the Hellenistic kingdoms. That translation was mostly complete by 250’s BC (to pick a round date) the average Roman soldier no longer resembled a hoplite that much. It is however important to remember that before around time of Marius (around 100 BC) Roman soldiers provided their own equipment so there was plenty of room for variation.

Helmets were generally of the [Montefortino type](http://www.romancoins.info/MilitaryEquipment-Helmet-montefortino.html) : a hemispherical or slightly conical cap with an open face and hinged cheek plates. Ears were uncovered which was important for tactical awareness.

During the fourth century shields changed from the traditional Greek circular shape to a taller oval shape.

The manipular legions — at least, their front rankers, the [Hastati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastati) — used heavy javelins rather than the hoplite thrusting spear. After throwing their javelins the switched to a short stabbing sword.

Some well-off Romans still used solid cuirasses but others used smaller breastplates called pectorals or _cardiophylakes_ (Greek for “heart-protectors”) as in the image above. During the third century this was replaced by _lorica hamata_ , what we’d call “chain mail.”
