We’re reasonably sure that there is one — but only one. It’s known as the “[Tusculum Caesar](http://www.arthistoryreference.com/t145/4126.htm)”

It currently resides in the Museo d'Antichità in Turin. It was only unearthed in 1825 by Napoleon’s younger brother [Lucien Bonaparte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Bonaparte), and the identification of Caesar was not widely accepted until the 20th century. However comparisons with Caesar’s last coins and with a bust discovered in 2006 strongly suggest this is a Caesar, and that the portrait was done in the last few years of his life.

The artists of the late Republic tried to convey the seriousness of their subjects by emphasizing signs of age and tension. The sitter’s receding chin, male pattern baldness, and the wattles in his neck are all chronicled with unflinching realism.

All other portraits of Caesar are later; they generally date from the reign of his adoptive son, emperor Augustus. Augustus’s artists favored a more airbrushed idealized style — depending on how you look at it, either a smarmy kind of propaganda or a desperate embrace of serenity after a generation of civil wars.

The more familiar examples are often variants on what’s known as the [Chiaramonti Caesar](https://italianartsociety.tumblr.com/post/176192979000/the-tusculum-and-chiaramonti-caesars)

The Chiaramonti bust is more flattering, though it still retains nods to late-Republican gravitas. A somewhat telling change is that the Dictator’s bald spot — about which he was reputedly sensitive — is very underemphasized. It’s dated between Caesar’s death and the establishment of the empire, so somewhere between about 44 and 27 BC.

In 2006 a new bust was uncovered on the island of Pantelleria

This one is also dated to the early imperial period, and like the Chiaramonti it shows the creeping idealization overtaking the warts-and-all realism of the Tusculum bust. It does however retain the distinctive profile and the very broad temples of the Tusculum version.

There’s a dark horse candidate in the [Arles bust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arles_bust), which is often identified as a Caesar done shortly after his death. Art historians are divided on whether the bust really is a Caesar at all. The style does argue for a pre-imperial date but the resemblance to the Tusculum head is very much in the eye of the beholder.
