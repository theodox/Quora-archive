20,000 BC is well before the dawn of writing, which is generally dated between five and six thousand years ago. The dawn of urban life is significantly later too: the oldest known sites which most people would call urban are [Göbekli Tepe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe) in Turkey and [Jericho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho) in Palestine; both show signs of urban living around roughly 9,000 BC and have at least a little of the kinds of non-written evidence we can use to make guesses about culture, politics or religious practice.

20,000 years is an interesting figure for another reason: 20,000 years is about the peak of the last ice age when the climate was far cooler and dryer than it has been at any point in recorded history: much of northern Europe, for example, was submerged in glacial ice. Warming proceeded in fits and starts from around 20,000 years ago, interspersed with periods of renewed cooling. The most puzzling episode is as the [Younger Dryas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas)* : a brief but intense period of global cooling that lasted from about 10,900 to 9,700 BC. During that time it looks like global mean temperatures dropped by several degrees C _very_  fast — in decades, not centuries! — and then rose again with equal speed.**

The alternating blue-and-yellow bands are warmer and cooler periods in the interval since the end of the last glaciation about 20,000 years ago.

This means that there is a huge shift in human living conditions right in the middle of that 20,000 year span — one which saw enormous, Hollywood scale events: deforestation, mass extinctions, and epochal floods.

How, exactly all that relates to the history of early societies we don’t know, but it’s a good bet more than a few societies were wiped out. On the other hand it’s frequently suggested that the origins of settled agriculture — and, along with it, permanent settlements and thus “civilization” — are a reaction to the changes brought by the loss of food sources that accompanied the Younger Dryas event. So, you could say that there _could not be_  any civilization before about 10,000 BC — though (this is the age of the internet, after all) you’ll also find people who think they have identified pre-Dryas civilizations that were lost to history when the climate shifted so suddenly.



* Geologists get all the cool names.
