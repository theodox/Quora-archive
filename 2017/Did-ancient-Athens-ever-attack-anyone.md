Athens was the democracy that gives the lie to the line “Democracies don’t go to war with each other.”

To some degree, all Greek city states lived in a state of constant low-grade hostility with each other. They were physically very close to each other: Athens was less than 100 km from Thebes, her most persistent local rival. Sparta was about the same distance from Argos, her most frequent enemy. Alliances changed all the time, as cities ganged up on any one state that looked to become too powerful. These wars were not usually very deadly — it was extremely rare for a city to be completely defeated and absorbed by another — but they were very common; few Greek citizens would reach old age without participating in at least one war.

Athens was no exception to the generally high level of infighting between Greek cities. In fact, being the wealthiest city in Greece and possessing a navy which no other Greek state could rival, she had the luxury of pursuing bigger aims than just the usual squabbles about borders. This earned the city the unflattering nickname of _polis tyrannos_ , the tyrant city, for its high-handedness.

Athens turned[ the multi-state coalition against Persia into an empire in all but name](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-Athens-and-not-Sparta-the-leader-of-the-Delian-League), and when her “allies” were slow to pay their tributes Athens was willing to extract their money by force. Athens was usually ready[ to intervene on behalf of democratic city governments or democratic factions in other cities’ civil wars](http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_corinth_corcyra.html), since Athenians regarded democratic governments as natural allies. Worst of all, Athens was willing to attack neutral states with whom there was not even the ghost of a legitimate grievance when the odds looks good and the possible winnings looked big. Two famous examples are the island of [Melos,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Melos) a harmless neutral whose only crime was to be distantly related to Sparta, and [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Expedition) in Sicily which was a fellow democracy but also a rich and tempting prize.

It was ultimately Athens’ willingness to attack other cities without provocation that destroyed her leadership position in Greece. The Sicilian expedition, in particular, was a disaster: it decimated the Athenian army and navy when it failed but it also convinced many other Greeks that Athens could never be trusted. Military weakness and political pariah status combined to create the Spartan victory in the [Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War) and an abrupt end to Athens’ golden age.
