Here's s very over-simplified TLDR view. I'm sure there will be area specialists who quibble with my summaries so take with a grain of salt. That's traditional: the only written account of most of Europe in this period is the work (now mostly lost) of the Greek adventurer [Pytheas, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pytheas)which was widely disbelieved by his contemporaries (even when he was right). For a detailed look at him you could check out [The Extraordinary Voyage of Pytheas the Greek. ](http://amzn.to/1OQVNaZ)

__ITALY__ 

Italy is mostly city-states with institutions and economies that are pretty similar to the Greek variety, though in general more rural and not as culturally sophisticated. 

The peninsula is dominated by two big alliance structures, one led by the Romans, seconded by the Latin cities; the other, looser grouping led by the Samnites. The southern end of the peninsula is scattered with Greek city-states that feud with each other all the time. Sicily is dominated by the Greek city of Syracuse but there are Carthaginian colonies on the southern and western shores. Northern Italy is dominated by Gauls, who to us would probably bring to mind either Asterix and Obelix or the legends of [Cú Chulainn. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%BA_Chulainn)In English, we'd probably call them "Celts."

Although the Gauls/Celts were not as economically or politically sophisticated as the Romans they were a serious force to be reckoned with: it was a Gallic army which sacked Rome in 390, right around when Alexander's father was born: the only army to do so until the Goths, 800 years later.

__FRANCE (GAUL)__ 

Most of modern France is inhabited by relatives of the Italian Gauls; again, they are people we would automatically identify as 'Celtic', from art style and their fondness for mustaches. They are the largest single group in Europe from Spain to modern Germany:

 However they are not politically unified -- they are a huge, unstable collection of peoples who share cultural traits but not much else. Most of them live rural lives centered on stock-raising; cattle raids between rival clans or tribes are common and low-grade warfare is pretty endemic (at this stage -- as in medieval Ireland -- they still fight in the heroic style of Homeric epics, from chariots). The primary way they transmit culture is through epic poems delivered by professional bards. Their settlements were usually hill-forts of the kind that are still visible in some parts of England, such as [Maiden Castle. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_Castle,_Dorset)

Southern France also hosts several Greek cities: the most important is [Massilia](http://www.ancient.eu/massilia/) (Marseille) which is a prosperous Greek outpost. There is already a significant amount of trade between the Mediterranean and the Celtic world. Over the next couple of centuries trade funneled through Massilia and up into the interior of France will gradually transform the Gallic lifestyle into a more urban mode -- but that is still in the future.

__SPAIN__ 

Spain has several layers of different populations. The ancestors of modern Basques are the oldest group, probably direct descendants of the original post-ice-age settlers. In the north they are frequently pitted against the relatives of the same Gauls; the Spanish branch of the amorphous Gallo-Celtic world are usually referred to as [Celtiberians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtiberians) . 

Along the east coast are the original [Iberians, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberians)who may or may not be related to the proto-Basques. [ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberians) Many of these live a similar 'early Iron-Age' lifestyle like the Celts (in later times both Romans and Carthaginians will find them excellent soldiers: the Iberians were one of the biggest contingents on both sides of the Punic wars). In the southwest of Spain, near modern Cadiz, they lived a more urban city-state lifestyle: the city of [Tartessos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartessos) was a a prosperous trading city with a bustling economy based on mines, particularly silver and tin (which was extremely valuable as a necessary component of bronze making). Some people think that Tartessos is the original source of the the legends of Atlantis. Although Tartessos seems to have disappeared by Alexander's time other urban centers -- and the all-important mines -- are still prospering.

 There are a couple of Greek colonies on the east coast, particularly at [Empúries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emp%C3%BAries) in modern Catalonia. The biggest outside influence is a large series of Carthaginian colonies all along the southern and eastern coasts. These are mostly permanent trading posts rather than fully-fledged cities. Over the next century, as Carthage expands its empire more aggressively into Spain, these will become bigger and more important though the Carthaginians won't ever be a large percentage of the peninsula's population.

__BRITISH ISLES__ 

The biggest population group in the British Isles are related to those Gauls again, at least linguistically. The island populations seem to have been rather later in joining the Iron Age than their mainland cousins (when the Romans invade, 300 years from now, they will still be confronting heroic fighters in chariots). These Britons still practice [human sacrifice, and maybe ritual cannibalism. ](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/03/090320-druids-sacrifice-cannibalism.html)

One interesting feature of this period in the islands is that some cultures seem to have deliberately avoided the gradual growth in inequality which was slowly pushing the mainland Gauls towards a more urban life. Cross-channel trade linkage between the Britons and the mainland Gauls seems to have weakened, though -- with no written records -- we don't know if this was an economic change, a reflection of political tensions, simply poverty in Britain. In general the British Isles are very loosely connected to the big international trade networks, although there are occasional visits from Phoenician, Greek or Gallic traders. The most prosperous, internationally connected part of Britain is Cornwall, whose tin mines have been in operation for more than a thousand years at this point.

__SCANDINAVIA AND GERMANY__ 

There aren't a lot of Germans in Germany: most of the inhabitants are part of the ubiquitous Gallic group. The Roman's won't coin the word _Germani_  for another 80 years. 

We think -- we aren't really sure, since again this is a pre-literate culture -- that most of the "Germanic" peoples at this time would actually be living in modern Scandinavia, slowly expanding south and east into modern Germany. They are only semi-settled, picking up and moving frequently -- a terror to their neighbors but also a disappointment to later archeologists since they leave little unambiguous evidence of their passage. As semi-nomads they are primarily pastoralists, driving their cattle and horses with them, though when they settle down they also farm. 

As often happens with nomadic pastoralists, they are also ferocious warriors. A couple of hundred years in the future one of their big migrations will severely upset the politics of Gaul and Italy and ending with the terrible [Cimbrian War ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimbrian_War)-- also setting the stage for the rise of Marius, Sulla and Caesar and the end of the Roman Republic.

__CENTRAL EUROPE__ 

Most of Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary was part of the Gaulish/Celtic world, sharing similar art and economics with Gaul proper (the original 'center' of the Celtic world was at Hallstadt, in Austria, but it was drifting westward throughout this period). 

Farther south, the dominant culture was the [Thracians. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thracians) Like the Celts, these were divided up into many political units, ranging from sophisticated kingdoms in the southeast (perennial rivals to Alexander's Macedonians, and sometime friends/sometime foes of the Persians) to more rural, tribal peoples in the central Balkans. The Thracians were well known to the Greeks; the Thracian deity [Zalmoxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalmoxis) for example was widely known and occasionally honored in Greek cities. Thracian kings also ruled along the shores of the Black Sea as far as modern day Crimea.

__EASTERN EUROPE__ 

Even more than Germany, modern-day Eastern Europe was on the move: the area was dominated by a number nomadic, pastoralist cultures which the Greeks and Romans lumped together as [Scythians. ](http://www.ancient.eu/Scythians/)These generally spoke an language related to modern Iranian and were primarily horse-nomads. They often lived and travelled in wagons

_A clay model of a Scythian wagon found in the Crimea_ 

Like many later horse nomads they were ferocious warriors, famous for their mobility and their skill as horse archers. The Persians at the height of their power had [fought and lost a disatrous campaing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Scythian_campaign_of_Darius_I) against the Scythians in the Balkans. The Greeks dealt extensively with the Scythians through their colonies in the Black Sea region: before this period slaves from Scythai formed the traditional police force of Athens. 

Despite their relatively simple life the Scythians were prosperous: like the much later Mongols they disdained urban life but found their own way of acquiring creature comforts -- whether by trade or at swordpoint. In particular the amber trade, coming down from the Baltic sea, was an extremely profitable one: amber was a rare and precious commodity throughout the Mediterranean world.

__WESTERN BALKANS__ 

Last but not least, the western Balkans -- roughly old Yugoslavia and modern Albania -- were inhabited by the [Illyrians. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrians)

[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrians) Linguistically at least they were distantly related to the Greeks, Romans, Italian and Thracians. Culturally they also borrowed from their neighbors but they had unique styles of their own was well. Illyrians were slightly unusual for combining city-state-like organization with monarchy: most city-states in the Mediterranean world were republics. The city-states were joined into larger kingdoms but local loyalties were the more important ones.

 They frequently fought the Macedonians to their south, and were notorious pirates up and down the Adriatic, and generally had a reputation as hotheaded and violent. Arrian records an Illyrian king sacrificing children on the eve of a battle against Alexander - and though that story could be wartime propaganda. They retained their warlike reputation down to the end of antiquity: this region produced [many of the soldier-emperors of the third, fourth and fifth centuries.](https://www.quora.com/Which-Roman-emperors-were-born-in-the-territory-of-Serbia)
