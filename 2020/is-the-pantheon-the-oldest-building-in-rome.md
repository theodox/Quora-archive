No. It is one of the most intact ancient buildings but it’s far from the earliest; it was built in the 120’s when the city was — at least according to Roman tradition — almost 900 years old.

Depending on on your definition of “intact” the oldest intact building in Rome is probably the [Temple of Hercules Victor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Hercules_Victor) in the old Forum Boarium; it was built in the middle of the second century BC so about three centuries before the pantheon. It’s near neighbor the [Temple of Portunus](https://www.wmf.org/project/temple-portunus) is probably the second oldest.

The oldest enterable space is not, however, a “building”. The above-ground structures of the are much later but the lowest underground chamber of the [Mamertine Prison](https://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-europe/infamous-mamertine-prison-and-supposed-incarceration-saint-peter-003447) dates back at least to the days of the Roman kingdom (traditionally, under Ancus Marcius around 625 BC). Some archaeologists date parts of the structure even earlier, back to the 9th century BC and thus before the legendary founding of Rome.

In the Republic and early empire the underground portions were used as a gaol; famous prisoners included the Gaulish resistance leader [Vercingetorix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vercingetorix), king [Jugurtha of Numidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugurtha), and according to tradition saints Peter and Paul.
