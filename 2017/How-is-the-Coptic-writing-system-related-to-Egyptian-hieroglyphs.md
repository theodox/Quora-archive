They are different ways of writing the same language. It was [knowledge of Coptic which allowed translators in the 19th century to start deciphering hieroglyphs](https://www.quora.com/How-were-the-Hieroglyphics-deciphered) â€” once a few phonetic values were identified using proper names, the translators could start matching up phonemes to words and prove that the hieroglyphics were Coptic.

The letter forms of Coptic come mostly from Greek , with a couple from the late form of the older [demotic script](https://www.britannica.com/topic/demotic-script). Demotic was a highly abstracted descendant of hieroglyphics but the connections between the original and demotic signs are unrecognizable to ordinary eyes.
