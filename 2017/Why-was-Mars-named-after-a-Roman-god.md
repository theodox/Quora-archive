Actually it’s really named [after a Babylonian god](https://www.quora.com/Were-the-planets-named-after-Greek-Roman-gods-or-did-the-ancients-believe-the-planets-were-gods). All of the planetary names in western astronomy come through the Greco-Roman astronomical tradition, but all of the planets visible to the naked eye were originally assigned to various gods by the Babylonians (who were doing astronomy long before the Greeks even knew how to write).

When the Greeks started picking up astronomical knowledge from the Babylonians, they did what they usually did with other people’s religions: they figured out some way of identifying the foreign gods with their own. They figured that the Babylonian god [Nergal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nergal), whose areas of expertise included warfare, chaos and destruction, was obviously just the Babylonian way of referring to [Ares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares), their own war-god. Ares became the patron of the red planet.

When the Romans started picking up astronomy from the Greeks they did exactly the same thing: Mars was the Italian war-god and he matched up with Ares, so of course he was also to be identified with Ἄρεως ἀστἡρ, “the star of Ares” — our planet Mars.
