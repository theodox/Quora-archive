__The bad news:__ A psych major isn't going to intersect very much with any kind of AI that is of practical use in games. While there may be some insights gleaned from psychology that can be used to create AI's that _seem_ realistic, game AI in general is nowhere close to a psychological simulation: just getting characters to find pathways and not walk into walls is a big challenge that we don't always meet. A Psych degree relates to a career in AI coding about the same way a degree in marine biology relates to a career in shipbuilding.

__The good news:__ There are actually quite a lot of jobs in the games business for psych majors. Games that center around online communities often benefit from academic psych training in statistics, metrics and the discipline of observing how people behave in a given context. Sometimes a game company wants to learn how to do metrics-driven response to customer feedback ("People think the game is too hard -- if we add a tutorial, does that fix that perception?") Sometimes they are looking for people to design split-tests ("Players who got the +5 sword in the first hour stayed 10% longer than players who did not") . Sometimes they want people to help them nudge their online communities towards more pro-social, less internet-insane behavior; Riot Games (of _League of legends)_ likes to call itself the[ largest virtual psychology lab in the world](https://medium.com/backchannel/inside-the-largest-virtual-psychology-lab-in-the-world-7c0d2c43cda5).
