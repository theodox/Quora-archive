___Originally answered___ _: What is the current scholarship position on Greco-Roman historians who stated that ancient Egypt was initially a colony of the 'Ethiopians'?_ 

The reference here is to Diodorus Siculus (= “Diodorus of Sicily”) a Greek historian who was roughly contemporary with Julius Caesar. His _[Historical Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotheca_historica)_ __ was written to be a “universal history”, one that covered the events of the entire known world.

> Quick note about terms:

> When Diodorus says “Ethiopians” he generally refers to the [Kingdom of Kush](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/kingdoms-kush/#:~:text=The%20Kingdom%20of%20Kush%20is,Kerma%2C%20Napata%2C%20and%20Mero%C3%AB.&text=Kerma%20was%20the%20most%20powerful,2450%20BCE%20and%201450%20BCE.), which in his day was ruled from the city of [Meroë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB) near what is today Shendi, Sudan. This area is often known in modern sources as “Nubia,” though the people referred to themselves as _Qoš_ and their Egyptian neighbors usually called them _K3š;_ you can mentally substitute “Nubian” if you prefer but I’ll stick with Kushite for consistency with Diodorus’ time.

> Sometimes, like other Greek writers of his time, Diodorus uses “Ethiopian” to refer to any dark-skinned people living south of the Sahara and “Libyan” to refer to the inhabitants of coastal North Africa, the ancestors of today’s Berbers. Modern Ethiopia traces its heritage to the[ Empire of Axum](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/kingdom-aksum/), centered about a thousand kilometers to the east and south of Meroe, speaking an unrelated language, and coming to power more or less by displacing the Kushites. I’ll use his “Ethiopian” for consistency, but reader should be aware of the vagueness of the original terminology.

If you’re looking for simple checkbox answer, it boils down to this: Diodorus was repeating information that was then current, even though that information was often contradictory. He was mostly repeating things he had read in earlier Greek accounts, though he made an effort to fact check them by speaking to Egyptian priests and visiting Ethiopians during a trip to Egypt. Those two groups gave him opposing points of view, and he repeated both without trying to reconcile them. I’ve appended the relevant bits to the end of this article for those who’d like to compare them first hand.

Overall Diodorus’ method might seem like shoddy workmanship, but it’s not — at least by the standards of his own time. Greek and Roman writers were very aware that the early history of their own people was extremely murky, full of conflicting stories, myths, and rival versions of the same events. They tended to err on the side of collecting stories about the semi-legendary past without being very definite about the truth of what they recorded, since they were well aware of how shaky the “facts” they had to work with could be. Diodorus affords the same treatment to ancient Egyptian and Ethiopian material that he does to the mythical origins of Greece. He also does the same for “Libya”, our North Africa, and for — tellingly — “Atlantis”. His primary addition to the stories he collects is a strong tendency towards assuming that most traditional gods were mortals who had received worship after their deaths, a common idea in his day known as “[Euhemerism](https://www.quora.com/Were-Greek-gods-real-individuals-or-were-they-at-least-immortalisations-of-real-individuals/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=297709247&share=4bd65a4f&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer)”.

So: modern scholars will generally regard Diodorus as a fairly reliable reporter of what the _discussion_ of deeper antiquity was like in the first century BC. However they don’t take his assertions literally, since he himself clearly did not do so: to take a different example, he provides __nine__ different birth places for the god Dionysus (Ethiopia, Egypt, India, four different named Greek cities, and two different cities called “Nysa”, one in Libya and one in Arabia) and he also entertains the idea that there were three different Dionysuses — a Libyan one, an Egyptian one, and a Greek one — at [different times](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4A*.html). When dealing with ancient matters (to him, anything before about our sixth century BC) his method was to collect and pass on whatever his sources said without aggressively vetting their assertions.

Obviously, therefore, his information is treated with caution. Modern historians will often take his statements into account as they examine other sources — for example, Egyptian records which we can read but which Diodorus clearly could not. His text is suggestive of areas for research, but not treated as authoritative. In this particular example, the respective claims of the Egyptians and Ethiopians are not assumed to be any more factual than Aeneas’s escape from the fall of Troy and founding what would eventually become Rome., a story he also relates.

We can trust Diodorus that someone told him the Ethiopians believed themselves to be the real ancestors of the Egyptians: he speaks of talking to Ethiopian ambassadors and Egyptian priests. It’s an interesting fact in itself, indicative of how intercultural communication worked in his era — but not particularly solid evidence for events three thousand years prior.



As regards the specific claims Diodorus retails about Egypt being an Ethiopian colony, the most concrete claim happens to have a couple of errors which are visible in light of what we know from archaeology.

Diodorus appears endorse an Ethiopian claim that they were the originators of Hieroglyphic writing: he actually calls it “Ethiopian writing which is called hieroglyphic among the Egyptians.” He quotes the Ethiopians as saying that among the Egyptians hieroglyphic literacy was secret knowledge passed down among the priests, but ordinary people didn’t use the hieroglyphs — while in Ethiopia, he say, everyone is literate in hieroglyphic writing.

However we can be sure this is incorrect for two reasons.

First, the account he gives of how hieroglyphics work is plainly wrong: He says ([book 3, chapter 4](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3A*.html))

> their writing does not express the intended concept by means of syllables joined one to another, but by means of the significance of the objects which have been copied and by its figurative meaning which has been impressed upon the memory by practice

In other words, the hieroglyphs are a purely symbolic script that records ideas, not spoken words. However are able to read hieroglyphic writing, and it’s clearly a complete way of recording the Egyptian language phonetically. Ideograms make up only a fraction of any hieroglyphic text. The idea that hieroglyphs were a purely symbolic language was popular with Greek writers in his day and later — but anyone who actually _used_ hieroglyphics would not describe them way Diodorus (or his Ethiopian informant) does.

Second, the claim that the Ethiopians used hieroglyphics exclusively is also demonstrably incorrect. There’s no doubt that the Kushites were literate in hieroglyphics — they used them to write both Egyptian and their own language. However they had [a script of their own invention ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meroitic_script)as well — although it borrowed characters from Demotic Egyptian, it was a streamlined alphabetic script, much easier to use than either hieroglyphs or Demotic.

When used formally Meroitic script could be written using hieroglyphic characters (used for their sound values) but more commonly it was written in a cursive, non-pictorial form. The cursive version was much more common than the hieroglyphic version and had been for over a century in Diodorus’s time. It’s worth mentioning that the oldest Meroitic language inscriptions date from around the second century BC: before that time, the Kushites used the Egyptian language for their records; if the “Ethiopians” really were the originators of hieroglyphic writing, it’s a bit puzzling that they started using it to write Egyptian rather than Meroitic.

Does this story still have anything to tell us about the prehistory of written language in the Nile Valley?

The relative priority of hieroglyphic writing in Egypt and Kush has been a hot topic in academia for the last forty or fifty years. Given the enormous disparity in archaeological attention between well-explored Egypt and much less thoroughly documented Sudan, this argument might someday swing either way. For now, though, the balance of opinion still favors and Egyptian origin. In older works, written in the shadow of European imperialism, it was more common to see Kushite civilization as a colonial offshoot imposed by Egyptians. Higher quality surveys resulting from a UNESCO mission in the 1960’s and subsequent investigations have revised that unbalanced view. A good example of the current scholarly opinion could be found in the late László Török’s[ The Kingdom Of Kush: Handbook of the Napatan-Meroitic civilization](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i54rPFeGKewC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) (1997), which essentially sees the Kushite civilization as a peer of Egypt: formed around the same time under similar conditions, but neither an ancestor of nor a colonial offshoot of Egypt.

The main scholarly sponsor of a Kushite-first scenario was [Bruce Beyer Williams](https://whitelevy.fas.harvard.edu/people/bruce-williams), whose 1980 Article “Lost Pharoahs of Nubia” made the case for a Kushite origin based on an artifact known as the [Qustul incense burner. ](https://oi.uchicago.edu/museum-exhibits/nubia/qustul-incense-burner)which he claimed showed a Kushite origin for symbols and rulership styles traditionally described as Egyptian. His view however is not widely accepted; an example of the counter-arguments is William Adams’ 1985 [“Doubts about the ‘Lost Pharoahs’.”](https://www.jstor.org/stable/544904?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A93db42fa3d356196ef248f5ad611f409&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) Since then, more ancient early hieroglyphic finds and a chemical analysis of the Qustul censer make the Kushite-priority view seem much less plausible.

__TLDR:__ 

The modern archaeological consensus does not depict Egypt as a Kushite (or Nubian, or Ethiopian) “colony” in the sense that Diodorus reported. Historians who read Diodorus would generally not use his evidence to prove anything about the real origins of Egyptian or Kushite/Nubian civilization three thousand years before his own time, but they do think it throws an interesting sidelight on the way Kushite, Egyptian and Greek cultures interacted and jostled for prestige in the first century BC.



It you want to put the whole thing in context for yourself, here are the relevant bits of Diodorus, with emphases added for focus (the complete text is [here](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/home.html)) .

Regarding the Egyptian - Ethiopian issue he says this in Book 3, chapter 2 (full text [here](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3A*.html)) :

> Now the Ethiopians, as historians relate, were the first of all men and the proofs of this statement, they say, are manifest. For that they did not come into their land as immigrants from abroad but were natives of it and so justly bear the name of "autochthones"​ is, they maintain, conceded by practically all men; furthermore, that those who dwell beneath the noon-day sun were, in all likelihood, the first to be generated by the earth, is clear to all; since, inasmuch as it was the warmth of the sun which, at the generation of the universe, dried up the earth when it was still wet and impregnated it with life,​ it is reasonable to suppose that the region which was nearest the sun was the first to bring forth living creatures. And they say that they were the first to be taught to honour the gods and to hold sacrifices and processions and festivals and the other rites by which men honour the deity; and that in consequence their piety has been published abroad among all men, and it is generally held that the sacrifices practised among the Ethiopians are those which are the most pleasing to heaven. As witness to this they call upon the poet who is perhaps the oldest and certainly the most venerated among the Greeks; for in the Iliad​ he represents both Zeus and the rest of the gods with him as absent on a visit to Ethiopia to share in the sacrifices and the banquet which were given annually by the Ethiopians for all the gods together.

And in 3.3 (same link as above):

> They [= the Ethiopians] say also that the Egyptians are colonists sent out by the Ethiopians, Osiris having been the leader of the colony. For, speaking generally, what is now Egypt, they maintain, was not land but sea when in the beginning the universe was being formed; afterwards, however, as the Nile during the times of its inundation carried down the mud from Ethiopia, land was gradually built up from the deposit. Also the statement that all the land of the Egyptians is alluvial silt deposited by the river receives the clearest proof, in their opinion, from what takes place at the outlets of the Nile; for as each year new mud is continually gathered together at the mouths of the river, the sea is observed being thrust back by the deposited silt and the land receiving the increase. And the larger part of the customs of the Egyptians are, they hold, Ethiopian, the colonists still preserving their ancient manners. For instance, the belief that their kings are gods, the very special attention which they pay to their burials, and many other matters of a similar nature are Ethiopian practices, while the shapes of their statues and the forms of their letters are Ethiopian; for of the two kinds of writing​ which the Egyptians have, that which is known as "popular" (demotic) is learned by everyone, while that which is called "sacred"​ is understood only by the priests of the Egyptians, who learn it from their fathers as one of the things which are not divulged, but among the Ethiopians everyone uses these forms of letters.

He goes on to list some other examples of Egyptian customs which the Ethiopians claim prove that Egypt was an Ethiopian colony, concluding “Many other things are also told by them concerning their own antiquity and the colony which they sent out that became the Egyptians, but about this there is no special need of our writing anything.”

Before considering the historicity of this from a modern perspective, it’s worth pointing out that Diodorus is _quoting_ what he says is contemporary Ethiopian opinion. This is completely in keeping with his general approach, which he lays out earlier in book 1, chapter 4 (full text [here](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1A*.html))

> with respect to the antiquity of the human race, not only do Greeks put forth their claims but many of the barbarians as well, all holding that it is they who were autochthonous and the first of all men to discover the things which are of use in life, and that it was the events in their own history which were the earliest to have been held worthy of record. So far as we are concerned, however, __we shall not make the attempt to determine with precision the antiquity of each nation or what is the race whose nations are prior in point of time to the rest and by how many years, but we shall record summarily, keeping due proportion in our account, what each nation has to say concerning its antiquity and the early events in its history.__  The first peoples which we shall discuss will be the barbarians, not that we consider them to be earlier than the Greeks, as Ephorus has said, but because we wish to set forth most of the facts about them at the outset, in order that we may not, by beginning with the various accounts given by the Greeks, have to interpolate in the different narrations of their early history any event connected with another people.

In other words, Diodorus says he’s going to repeat a variety of conflicting accounts of “pre-history” — which for him means pretty much anything before the Trojan War, which he dated to our 1184 BC. He doesn’t say he’s going to resolve the differing accounts. In fact, he begins his catalogue of other people’s origin stories with the Egyptians, book 1 chapter 10:

> Now the Egyptians have an account like this: When in the beginning the universe came into being, __men first came into existence in Egypt__ , both because of the favourable climate of the land and because of the nature of the Nile. For this stream, since it produces much life and provides a spontaneous supply of food, easily supports whatever living things have been engendered; for both the root of the reed and the lotus, as well as the Egyptian bean and corsaeon, as it is called, and many other similar plants, supply the race of men with nourishment all ready for use.​ As proof that animal life appeared first of all in their land they would offer the fact that even at the present day the soil of the Thebaid at certain times generates mice in such numbers and of such size as to astonish all who have witnessed the phenomenon; for some of them are fully formed as far as the breast and front feet and are able to move, while the rest of the body is unformed, the clod of earth still retaining its natural character. And from this fact it is manifest that, when the world was first taking shape, the land of Egypt could better than any other have been the place where mankind came into being because of the well-tempered nature of its soil; for even at the present time, while the soil of no other country generates any such things, in it alone certain living creatures may be seen coming into being in a marvellous fashion.

In other words: the Egyptians say Egypt — not Ethiopia — was the real origin of mankind. He goes on to list famous Greek deities and mortals who were really, on the Egyptian account, Egyptian_s,_ climaxing with a long list of Greek and other cities which were really Egyptian colonies:

> Now the Egyptians say that also after these events__†__  a great number of colonies were spread from Egypt over all the inhabited world. To Babylon, for instance, colonists were led by Belus, who was held to be the son of Poseidon and Libya; and after establishing himself on the Euphrates river he appointed priests, called Chaldaeans by the Babylonians, who were exempt from taxation and free from every kind of service to the state, as are the priests of Egypt;​ and they also make observations of the stars, following the example of the Egyptian priests, physicists, and astrologers. They say also that those who set forth with Danaus, likewise from Egypt, settled what is practically the oldest city in Greece, Argos, and that the nation of the Colchi in Pontus and that of the Jews, which lies between Arabia and Syria, were founded as colonies by certain emigrants from their country; and this is the reason why it is a long-established institution among these two peoples to circumcise their male children, the custom having been brought over from Egypt. Even the Athenians, they say, are colonists from Saïs in Egypt, and they undertake to offer proofs of such a relationship; for the Athenians are the only Greeks who call their city "Asty," a name brought over from the city Asty in Egypt.

Much of this “Egyptian” material is borrowed from other Greek writers. Here his Belus is the Semitic deity [Ba’al](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belus_(Babylonian)), who he assumes to have been a real mortal king following [Ctesias of Cnidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesias). The story about the Jews being Egyptian colonists is borrowed from an earlier Greek writer, [Hecataeus of Miletus](https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hecataeus-abderadeg). The story of Danaus being an Egyptian colonist was a common version in Greek mythology. The story of the Colchians being Egyptian colonists is probably borrowed from Herodotus, who may have had it from an Egyptian source.

At this point however Diodorus does add a comment of his own, not exactly a ringing endorsement of the literal truth of what he has reported (1.29):

> By many other statements like these, spoken more out of a love for glory than with regard for the truth, as I see the matter, they claim Athens as a colony of theirs because of the fame of that city.

> In general, the Egyptians say that their ancestors sent forth numerous colonies to many parts of the inhabited world, the pre-eminence of their former kings and their excessive population; but since they offer no precise proof whatsoever for these statements, and since no historian worthy of credence testifies in their support, we have not thought that their accounts merited recording.
