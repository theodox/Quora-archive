There are a lot of datable objects if you accept [carbon-14 dating](https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-14-dating), [dendrochronology](https://www.britannica.com/science/dendrochronology) and [ice-core dating](https://www.antarcticglaciers.org/question/how-are-ice-cores-dated/#:~:text=Ice%20cores%20can%20be%20dated,(Lemieux%2DDudon%20et%20al.&text=Dust%20is%20present%20in%20ice%20cores%2C%20and%20it%20contains%20Uranium.). Many of these go back well beyond anything like “history” with reasonable accuracy, though generally on the order of decade or centuries rather than days ands weeks.

If you need documentation, there’s a good argument that it’s a fragment of a cuneiform tablet from Ugarit (Ras Shamra, Syria) which records a solar eclipse that is probably the one visible from there on March 5, 1223 BC. There are two other eclipses that were visible from that location in the right general era (January 21, 1192 BC and May 3, 1375 BC) but the 1223 date is the best fit. The object itself is a contemporary record — not a later astronomical catalog or a prediction.



There are of course plenty of older objects. There are written texts in both Egypt and Mesopotamia that date back to within a century or so of 3100 BC. However the Ugarit tablet is the oldest one we can date with a fair degree of confidence — for the older stuff we often have dates that are only accurate to within maybe 150–200 years. Reliable dates are very hard to come by any time before the end of the Bronze Age (roughly, 1200 BC) which is what makes the Ugarit tablet so interesting.

If you demand a higher degree of certaintly, you have to fast forward to 825 BC. The Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III is an Assyrian monument, uncovered in the ruins of [Kalhu](https://www.worldhistory.org/Kalhu/) (more famous as “Nimrud”) in 1846. Assyrian royal records are quite reliable back to Shalmaneser’s reign; they can be checked against other royal chronicles in the region and they connect to a datable solar eclipse in the summer of 763 BC so we know they are quite solid. The obelisk records the events of the first 31 years of Shalmaneser’s reign, which began in 858/857 BC (the Assyrian year started in the spring). Since it’s clearly complete and Shalmaneser reigned for at least three more years, it must date to his 32d year which is our 826/825 BC. It’s also an interesting object because it contains one of the oldest external references to Israel (“beit Omri”, the house of Omri) and to Persia (“Parsua”).
