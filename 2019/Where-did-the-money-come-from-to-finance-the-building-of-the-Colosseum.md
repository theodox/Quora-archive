The more precise name of the structure is the _[Flavian amphitheater](http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/spw4s/RomanForum/GoogleEarth/AK_GE/AK_HTML/AS-005.html)_ _—_ it got its modern name from the fact that it used to stand in the shadow of [Colossus of Nero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_of_Nero) : a hundred-foot high nude statue, originally of the unpopular emperor, which was altered by the Flavian emperors to become a representation of Sol, the sun god.

_This coin (from around the year 240) shows the amphitheater with the colossus, at left._ 

The “Flavian” in the name is the real point here. The colosseum was built between the years 72 and 80 by emperor Vespasian, and his sons, the emperors Titus and Domitian. The Flavians were the first emperors who had no direct familial connection to the first imperial house. Moreover they were also not members of the traditional Roman aristocracy. So, they instituted ambitious building programs in Rome and other parts of Italy as a way of putting a visible public face on their own rule (there is another [another Flavian Amphitheater — the third largest in the empire — in Pozzuoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavian_Amphitheater_(Pozzuoli)), near Naples, where Rome’s upper classes spent their vacations) .

The money to fund the colosseum came from two sources: from taxes and from the spoils of war.

__Taxation__ 

When Vespasian first assumed the purple at the end of 69, Rome’s finances were a mess. Nero had nearly bankrupted the imperial government with his lavish public entertainments and building programs.* He debased the currency and extorted money from wealthy Senators, but the imperial finances were at a dangerous ebb — not only did the state have to worry about external enemies, the new emperor also had to recall that the legionaries who helped put him on the throne expected a healthy bonus.

So, Vespasian acted quickly to raise taxes. Roman taxes are not well understood (though by modern standards they were quite low — somewhere between 3 and 10 percent of GDP: the modern OECD average is 34%). Nevertheless raising taxes was unpopular, and Vespasian gained a reputation for miserliness despite his successful reign:

> The only thing for which he can fairly be censured was his love of money. For not content with reviving the imposts which had been repealed under [short-lived emperor] Galba, he added new and heavy burdens, increasing the amount of tribute paid by the provinces, in some cases actually doubling it, and quite openly carrying on traffic which would be shameful even for a man in private life; for he would buy up certain commodities merely in order to distribute them at a profit. He made no bones of selling offices to candidates and acquittals to men under prosecution, whether innocent or guilty. He is even believed to have had the habit of designedly advancing the most rapacious of his procurators to higher posts, that they might be the richer when he later condemned them; in fact, it was common talk that he used these men as sponges, because he, so to speak, soaked them when they were dry and squeezed them when they were wet.

> Some say that he was naturally covetous and was taunted with it by an old herdsman of his, who on being forced to pay for the freedom for which he earnestly begged Vespasian when he became emperor, cried: "The fox changes his fur, but not his nature." Others on the contrary believe that he was driven by necessity to raise money by spoliation and robbery because of the desperate state of the treasury and the privy purse; to which he bore witness at the very beginning of his reign by declaring that forty thousand millions were needed to set the State upright. This latter view seems the more probable, since he made the best use of his gains, ill-gotten though they were.

_[Suetonius, life of Vespasian, XVI](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html)_ 

Vespasian’s most famous tax was notorious, because (unlike many taxes aimed at landed property or the import trade) it hit almost everyone: his tax on public latrines. His no-nonsense approach to fundraising left a lasting impression on the public**:

> When Titus found fault with him for contriving a tax upon [latrines], he held a piece of money from the first payment to his son's nose, asking whether its odour was offensive to him. When Titus said "No," he replied, "Yet it comes from urine."

[XXIII](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html)

__The Spoils of War__ 

The other main source of money in the Flavian coffers was war. Vespasian had been commander of the Roman armies in the east when the civil war broke out in 69. He returned to Rome and took power, but his son Titus stayed behind to [finish the war that Vespasian had already been fighting in Judea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War).

In the fall of 70, Titus’ legions breached the walls of Jerusalem. The city was looted remorselessly; the treasures of the Jewish temple were paraded through the streets of Rome in triumph.

Probably as important as the gold and silver looted from Jerusalem ([which was a fairly prosperous place, thanks to the popular balsam plantations in the Dead Sea region](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-Empire-in-Jerusalem-and-Judea-It-seems-such-an-isolated-backwater-with-no-economic-value-to-the-empire/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=d80a90a8&srid=zLvM)) was the flood of captives. The Jewish historian Josephus claimed, at the time, that 97,000 survivors were enslaved in the aftermath.*** Although slave prices varied considerably in this era at a reasonable guess of 2500 sestertii a head the captives of Judea would have fetched about 240 million sestertii — enough to cover the entire imperial budget for three or four months.

_This coin of Vespasian has a double meaning: the reverse says IUDEA CAPTA, “Judea captured.” However the same phrase in Latin could also mean “A captured Jewish woman,” which may be what the seated figure at right represents. Most of the survivors of Jerusalem were women. Photo:_ _[Biblical Archaeology Society](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/news/judaea-capta-coin-uncovered-in-bethsaida-excavations/)_ 

__Cost and payments__ 

The actual cost of construction is not known. Any answer we can offer has to be a guesstimate at best.

For comparison purposes we could note a kilometer of aqueduct cost about 2.5 million sestertii. The outer circumference of the colosseum is just over a kilometer — but of course the building also included interior seating and the hypogeum (the underground network of tunnels and chambers that was part of running the place). Moreover, the lower levels of the colosseum were sheathed in expensive, lavish materials like porphyry. So, we have to add some kind of fudge factor to accommodate the difference between just the outer shell and the finished building. An entirely made-up multiplier of 10x would give a very approximate cost of about 25 million sestertii; very expensive indeed (about 2/3 of the annual tax revenues of Alexandria, the second city of the empire) but not inconceivable for the centerpiece of a vital propaganda-through-building campaign.

Presumably the number — whatever it was in reality — was largely funded by the spoils of the Judaean campaign. Unfortunately we know very little about the actual mechanics of Roman finance — in particular, it’s hard to know how much of off the spoils of a campaign actually ended up in the emperor’s hands, or how long it took the Vespasian’s tax changes to positively affect the government’s cash flow. However we do know that the confluence of new taxes and the spoils of the Judaean war were the primary sources of income during the years when the colosseum was built, and that the Roman state had to pay for its projects in cash: there was no Roman equivalent of bond issues.



*In Nero’s defense, some of that building was necessitated by [Great Fire of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_Rome) in 64.
** Even today some people in Italy refer to urinals as _[vespasiani](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vespasiano)_ _.
***_ He also claimed 1.1 million deaths from the destruction of the city, though most modern historians regard that as a significant exaggeration. However the slave count is rarely contested, probably because it will have been recorded by the Romans as part of the profits of the war.
