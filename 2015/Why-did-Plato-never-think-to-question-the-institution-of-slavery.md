There were some contemporary thinkers who did oppose slavery, although in antiquity that was always a minority position. Certainly, the criminality of the whole idea was not obvious back then for several reasons:


Society was _functionally_  aristocratic, even in democratic Athens. Rich people seemed almost like a different species from the poorest of the poor: They were taller: Access to protein meant that aristocrats might make the respectable modern height of 6'; poorly fed peasants and the urban poor would be lucky to reach 5'4" (see [Were people in the Iron and Bronze Ages stronger than people today?](https://www.quora.com/Were-people-in-the-Iron-and-Bronze-Ages-stronger-than-people-today)) They had decent hygiene and access to barbers, doctors, and dentists. They were also likely to be literate, and even if not they had the leisure and social status to pick up the poetry and musical skills which marked an educated person. You can get an emotional idea of the contrast by picturing a Hollywood star, healthy and groomed, next to a homeless person unkempt and in tatters. In the modern world we insist that the things the star and the street person have in common are more important than the things that sets them apart; but in a world without that training it's not an obvious conclusion -- to be an egalitarian in the 4th century BC took an unusual moral imagination.

Those aristocratic values also de-valued work. Working with your hands, or even being too engaged in commerce, was looked down on (one thing Plato did do in his_Laws_  was to____ ___forbid___ __ citizens from working so they could focus on their civic duties -- which of course assumes the existence of non-citizens to keep the whole place running.) Expecting an upper class Athenian (Plato was an aristocrat) to actually work at feeding, clothing or housing himself would be like expecting the CEO of a big modern company to get his own coffee: it was assumed to be too _menial._ 

In a much poorer world, it was commonly accepted that the alternative to slavery for many people was death by starvation or just death. Most slaves were either prisoners of war or debtors who could not pay their debts (unlike most other societies of the day, Athens forbade voluntary slavery and the sale of free children by their own parents). The likely alternative for prisoners and debtors was to be killed, since long term imprisonment was unlikely and ancient armies lived on plunder. For the very poor, slavery could represent an economic improvement over the life of a peasant on a failing farm or worse, a life of wandering beggary -- if it hadn't been attractive to some, it would not have needed to be outlawed. 


For many slaves in the ancient world -- in contrast to the US or South American varieties -- slavery was not necessarily a life sentence. Slaves could and did earn their freedom. This tended to hide the horror of the system somewhat, particularly when it was popularly believed (as in the last paragraph) that the real alternative was likely death.

Slavery was essentially universal. We're lucky enough to live in a world where slavery is an underground, furtive anomaly. In Plato's day it was one of the few common features in a world that otherwise featured an incredible diversity of lifestyles and economies. None of the large scale civilizations of that time and place did not practice slavery. Among smaller societies, the minority that didn't have slaves usually had some kind of serfdom.

So, for all those reasons slavery was regarded, by and large, as a 'natural' institution. The debates around it tended to center not on __slavery: right or wrong__  but on __who ought to be slaves__ , and under what circumstances. In this regard Plato was unusual, he held that Greeks ought not to enslave other Greeks. 

In Plato's _Republic_  there is no mention of slavery Libertarian minded critics have argued that the entire society he describes is unfree, which does sort of point out what's really going on in the _Republic_ : in that system the idea that some were 'born to obey' and others born to rule found embodiment in a tiered caste structure rather than a simple division of slave and free. In the _Laws_ , by contrast, he describes a much more conventional state which does have slaves, and with laws that were a somewhat streamlined version of ordinary Attic laws about slavery. In both cases, though, he adopts the aristocratic assumption that the truly 'free' life of a citizen is incompatible with manual labor and toil and that only those who are 'naturally fit' for the life of the mind can be trusted with freedom. 

It's an attitude, sadly, you could easily find defenders for 150 years ago, and one that constantly threatens to creep back in whenever we drop our guard.
