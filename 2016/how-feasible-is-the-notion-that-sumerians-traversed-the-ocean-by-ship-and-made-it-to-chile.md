It's vanishingly unlikely.

The Sumerians were not great seafarers - their idea of ‘far away and over the sea’ was “[Dilmun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilmun)” — probably Bahrain — or [Magan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magan_(civilization)), probably Oman. The most distant place they refer to in their texts is [Meluhha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meluhha), which is most likely at the mouth of the Indus River although some people put it in the Red Sea. All of those are coasting destinations, not open-water sailing; and all are within 1,000 miles of the mouth of the Euphrates.

The Phoenicians — vastly better seamen, who circumnavigated Africa, never made the relatively achievable trip from Morocco to the Caribbean. Neither did the Greeks or the Romans. Sailing from Sumeria to the west coast of South America would involve weathering both Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope, which remained deadly even into the 20th century.

To top it all off the Sumerians had terrible access to timber for boat building: one of the legendary deeds of Gilgamesh was going to Lebanon to bring back cedar logs, a nearly priceless commodity. They built their boats primarily out of reeds, like modern Marsh Arabs:

FWIW it took Thor Heyerdahl 5 months to travel 4,000 miles in his recreated reed boat. He never got out of the relatively friendly waters of the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. Sumer to Chile would be around 3 times as far, including at least 4,000 miles of blue-water sailing in the cold, stormy south Atlantic. Assuming the ship didn’t just disintigrate, where would you store 4 months worth food and water for 10–15 crew on that something that small?
