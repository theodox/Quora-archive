We don't really know because of the spotty evidence we have for early civilizations.

The earliest written law prescribing the death penalty is in the [Code of Ur-Nammu, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Ur-Nammu)some time around 2100 BC.

_The code of Ur-Nammu on a clay cylinder. Item # 1 is "If a man commits a murder, he must be killed"_  

Probably not coincidentally this is the oldest surviving law code of any kind. Imprisonment is a fairly expensive proposition in an ancient society: in a world where much of the population lived on the edge of hunger all the time, feeding, clothing and housing a criminal seemed perverse.*

_I am Ur-Namma, the mighty king of Ur! I am the protecting genius of my city. Wickedness cannot pass unnoticed before my eyes. I am the knowledgeable judge. I strike against those guilty of capital offenses and make them tremble!_ __ 

For older evidence of state violence you can go back further to something like the Egyptian [Narmer Palette, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer_Palette)about 1,000 years before Ur-Nammu. This shows Narmer, the semi-legendary Pharaoah who united upper and lower Egypt, about to knock a defeated enemy on the head with his mace:

 * There's a debatable text about [Gudea of Lagash](http://sumerianshakespeare.com/25401/) -- a contemporary of Ur-Nammu -- that seems to imply he locked up those guilty of capital crimes instead of killing them. Of course it also points out there was already a phrase for _capital crimes_  while there were still living mammoths in Siberia.
