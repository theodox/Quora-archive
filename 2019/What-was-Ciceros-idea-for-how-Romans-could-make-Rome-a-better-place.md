Cicero’s central political aim was what he called _concordia_ , which means something like “solidarity” or “fellow-feeling.” However a one-word translation doesn’t capture the interesting overtones.

There are two very different traditions about _concordia,_ both of which Cicero will have known well. In one version, _concordia_  represents the successful resolution of social strife by a patriotic union of sensible Romans — in this version, the building of the [temple of Concordia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Concord) in the Roman forum in 367 BC was the symbolic end of the long struggle between the Patricians and Plebeians, who united to defeat an invasions by the Gauls after nearly succumbing to a civil war. On the other hand the failure of _concordia_  meant ruin: Concordia’s temple was rededicated in 121 BC by Lucius Opimius, the consul who murdered Gaius Gracchus and 3,000 of his lower-class supporters — a piece of shameless hypocrisy that was proverbial even five centuries after Cicero’s death. So _concordia_  was as central, and as elusive, a political ideal as modern goals like “freedom” and “equality”.

In practical terms, Cicero identified _concordia_  with a kind of moderate conservatism. He was a provincial (from Arpinum, in Campania) and his instincts were always those of what you might call the “centurion class” of Italy outside the city: people who were prosperous but not wealthy, traditional in outlook but not automatically beholden to aristocratic pretensions, and generally inclined to a patriotic, law-and-order view of the world. He was what an old school Marxist would have described as _petit-bourgeoise._ 

However, Cicero added a unique personal twist to this fairly simple, bourgeois world view. Unlike the ordinary Roman provincial, Cicero was was deeply versed in Greek rhetoric and Greek philosophy. For most Roman politicians of his era, politics was about the clash of interest groups and patronage networks — this is part of the reason we see what seem to be so many incongruous alliances between figures who would seem to be “ideological” enemies in the late Republic: most Romans, even politicians, were practical rather than ideological. But Cicero had a Greek passion for the power of discourse — he believed in the power and the necessity of using words to shape society, a view that was not entirely in line with the traditional Roman self image of bluff honesty and “common sense.”

One way Cicero envisioned _concordia_  was what he called _concordia ordinum_ , “peace between the orders” — where “orders” was the very Roman idea of legally recognized social classes. The ideal (a sadly elusive one in the last decades of the Republic) was that each class of society would contribute to the general welfare in its own way in an atmosphere of reciprocal respect and mutual aid: as he put it in the Fourth Catilinarian:

> Omnes ordines ad conservandam rempublicam, mente, voluntate, studio, virtute, voce consentiunt

> All ranks unite for preserving the Republic, with mind, will, zeal, excellence, and voice.

Later in the same speech he calls out all of the social classes, making a point of including people rarely mentioned on the Senate floor:

> omnis ingenuorum adest multitudo, etiam tenuissimorum. quis est enim cui non haec templa, aspectus urbis, possessio libertatis, lux denique haec ipsa et commune patriae solum cum sit carum tum vero dulce atque iucundum?

> The entire multitude of honest men, even the poorest is here; for who is there to whom these temples, the sight of the city, the possession of liberty, the very earth and sun common to us all — for whom all that is not dear and sweet and loved?

Probably the best way to understand Cicero’s ideology is to read his ___[De Officiis](https://www.nlnrac.org/classical/cicero/documents/duties-de-officiis)___ ___,___ “About Duty.” Based mostly on contemporary Stoicism, the book argues for a strong emphasis on solidarity and communal bonds:

> … we are not born for ourselves alone, but our country claims a share of our being, and our friends a share; and since, as the Stoics hold, everything that the earth produces is created for man’s use; and as men, too, are born for the sake of men, that they may be able mutually to help one another; in this direction we ought to follow Nature as our guide, to contribute to the general good by an interchange of acts of kindness, by giving and receiving, and thus by our skill, our industry, and our talents to cement human society more closely together, man to man.

The intense political stresses that Cicero saw in his public life are mostly absent from the book — though this may have to do with the fact that he wrote after Caesar’s victory in the civil war, at a time when he believed his correspondence was being closely watched by spies. It’s a very universalizing vision as well, somewhat abstracted from his usual emphasis on the specifically Roman character of his public career and from the particulars of retail politics:

> ..there is a bond of fellowship—although I have often made this statement, I must still repeat it again and again—which has the very widest application, uniting all men together and each to each. This bond of union is closer between those who belong to the same nation, and more intimate still between those who are citizens of the same city-state.

> It is for this reason that our forefathers chose to understand one thing by the universal law and another by the civil law. The civil law is not necessarily also the universal law; but the universal law ought to be also the civil law. But we possess no substantial, life-like image of true Law and genuine Justice; a mere outline sketch is all that we enjoy. I only wish that we were true even to this; for, even as it is, it is drawn from the excellent models which Nature and Truth afford.

> LXIX

_De Officiis_ offers an optimistic view of social relations — the core idea is that there’s no real conflict between “duty” and “self interest” when properly understood, a forerunner of the 18th century ideal of “enlightened self interest.” Reciprocal kindness, devotion to duty, and loyalty are the bonds of Cicero’s idealized vision.

The emphasis is on on reciprocal kindness and fellowship is almost sad, when one recalls that it was written by the survivor of a civil war, living under something like house arrest. _De Officiis_  had a long afterlife as a moral manual (it was one of the most popular philosophical tracts of the Middle Ages) but it was not a realistic view of late Republican realities.

Although he is known for fiery rhetorical flights (and for executing the Catilinarian revolutionaries) Cicero in general tried to steer a middle course between the populism of politicians like Caesar and the pretensions of the aristocrats. He didn’t want to have to take sides in the increasingly violent division which was pulling the republic apart during his lifetime, choosing instead to believe that patriotism, fellow feeling, and the majesty of Roman tradition would keep society from unravelling . Unfortunately for him, that course was not realistic: his generation did not have the luxury of not taking sides, and when forced to choose the backed the losing side. Centuries later, St. Augustine joked that the Romans would have been more honest to have built that temple in the forum to Discord than to Concord; a sad sidelight on how Cicero’s ideals were out of step with his era.

Ironically, the real apostle of Cicero’s moderate politics was also complicit in his death. Octavian Augustus — whom Cicero helped to raise to prominence, hoping to use him against Marc Antony — had many of the same sentimental, provincial and bourgeois ideals. He believed in Roman tradition, in patriotism, and in the ideal of a Roman society bound by reciprocal obligations both up and down the social scale. The difference was that Augustus was also a ruthless warlord, who was willing and able to shed blood on a huge scale to gain power before gradually transforming himself into the avuncular patron of _concordia_  and _Romanitas_ . The price of concord was the death of the Republic itself — and that of Cicero, whom Augustus allowed Antony to kill after the two warlords formed their military junta.
