It's possible: you can see clear evidence of systematic erasures in Egyptian monuments, most notably those of [Akhenaten](http://www.djibnet.com/photo/el-amarna/torso-of-akhenaten-damnatio-memoriae-iconoclasm-5569861415.html) and [Hatshepsut](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/hatshepsut_01.shtml)

_Hapshepsut, probably erased by her one-time co-ruler Tuthmosis III_ 

However, I don't think you need a cultural borrowing to explain the practice: there's plenty of evidence for systematic defacement of depictions of the unpopular and no-longer-around-to-protect-themselves. For example the images of many Assyrian rulers seem to have been [systematically defaced](http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/assyria-to-iberia/blog/posts/vanished-images) after the fall of Nineveh;

And of course modern history provides many more current examples -- images of everybody from Stalin to Gandhi to Jefferson Davis have been attacked â€” or more politely, dismantled and hidden away in basements. For a certain kind of mood or moment, [smashing statues can be the sweetest revenge](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/dec/09/smashing-statues-sweetest-revenge-protesters-lenin-kiev).
