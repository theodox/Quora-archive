It matters a lot when you’re asking, The supply of potential slaves fluctuated — after the big wars in the second century BC, and after Caesar’s conquest of Gaul supply was high and prices low; but in less violent times prices were higher. From the second to the late third century slave prices went up my more than 30X in nominal value, due to the hyperinflation which affected the Roman economy during the civil wars of the 3rd century.

We do have the list from [Diocletian’s Edict on Maximum Prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_on_Maximum_Prices), in 301. It gives explicit prices in the currency of his own day (these are visible in the image above in the top right, btw).

boy or girl, up to age 8: 10,000
boy or girl, up to 16: 20,000 
male, 16 -40: 30,000
female, 16–40: 25,000
male, 40–60: 25,000
female 40–60: 23,000
male, 60+: 13,000
female, 60+: 10,000

For contrast the same list includes an _equus curulis —_ a chariot or racehorse — for 100,000. An ordinary free laborer of that period earned 25 denarii a day; a bushel of wheat cost 100 denarii and a half-liter of wine 30.

These should be taken as ballparks: the price edict was notorious failure. However they give some idea.
