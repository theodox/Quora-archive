In the strictest sense, we don't know. The records relating directly to this are pretty spotty and not of the highest quality: Suetonius records that

> He utterly abolished the cruel and inhuman religion of the Druids among the Gauls, which under Augustus had merely been prohibited to Roman citizens

There’s no direct evidence for how Claudius (or his advisors — it’s [far from clear how much Claudius really controlled his own empire](https://www.quora.com/How-did-Claudius-Caesar-reign-as-an-emperor/answer/Steve-Theodore)) justified this move. It’s also worth noting that those ‘utterly abolished’ Druids cropped up again in the next generation, so this passage is at best a bit overstated.

Given how the Romans tended to react to any religion which posed a threat (real or perceived) to their hegemony, though, it’s not hard to see how a ban came about. The Druids were ultimately the core of what passed for national consciousness among the many Celtic or Gallic peoples of northern Europe. Politically, Gaul, Britain, Noricum, Rhaetia and the central Balkans were fragmented into many small, competing groups who rarely cooperated for political ends. Caesars’ wars in Gaul, for example, involved dizzying changes of alliance between different Gallic nations fighting both against and for the Romans at different times. A national ideal uniting all of the Gauls against was not going to emerge from the fractious tribes and city-states political leaders — if there was going to be a pan-Gallic opposition to Rome, it would come from the Druids.

This wasn’t just a fancy of Claudius. Tacitus also notes that in 69, the “year of the 4 emperors,” a Gallic rising was fomented by Druids recalling the ancient sack of Rome and prophesying an end to the empire.* So clearly the Druids survived Claudius to some degree — and equally clearly they could and did provide a focal point for opposition to Roman power. In Britain under Nero the Romans clearly targeted the Druids as the moral center of the native opposition, going well out of their way to to target the Druidic center of [Anglesey](http://resourcesforhistory.com/celtic_druids.htm) in 60 and again in 78.

_A British Druid, imagined inciting Britons to resist the Romans_ 

The Gauls also played a special part in the Roman imagination, and this influenced attitudes towards the Druids.

As the[ only foreigners who had ever conquered the city of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Allia), the Gauls remained hereditary bogeymen to the Romans long after Caesar’s conquests; their physical size, outlandish complexions and red hair, and their swagger were all unnerving to Romans of the first century. Druidism — particularly its ongoing practice of human sacrifice and, in Britain, of ritual cannibalism — played into traditional Roman fears of wild men out of the north.** These alien and “barbaric” aspects of Druidism genuinely offended the Roman sense of propriety — though of course they were also valuable as targets of hostile propaganda, much as the Carthaginian practice of child sacrifice had been during the Punic Wars.

Finally, there’s an interesting — if conjectural — political angle.

The one genuine political achievement of Claudius’s reign is the [Lyon Decree](http://comp.uark.edu/~cmuntz/texts/claudius-lyon-speech.html), which allowed the upper classes of Gaul to join the Roman Senate. It was the first major extension of the Senatorial order outside of Italy and the foundation for the long-term internationalization of the Roman aristocracy. Even though Claudius was a weak emperor, this seems to have been a personal project of his (he spent part of his boyhood in Lyon, which may have inclined him favorably toward the Gauls). We even have the text of his actual speech to the Senate, which speaks directly to the Roman tradition of assimilation and the ancient fear of the Gallic nation — and, incidentally, gives us a good control for the summary of the same ideas recorded by Tacitus.

> What was the ruin of Sparta and Athens, but this: that mighty as they were in war, they spurned from them as aliens those whom they had conquered? Our founder Romulus, on the other hand, was so wise that he fought as enemies and then hailed as fellow-citizens several nations on the very same day. Strangers have reigned over us. That freedmen's sons should be intrusted with public offices is not, as many wrongly think, a sudden innovation, but was a common practice in the old commonwealth. But, it will be said, we have fought with the Senones. I suppose then that the Volsci and Aequi never stood in array against us. Our city was taken by the Gauls. Well, we also gave hostages to the Etruscans, and passed under the yoke of the Samnites. On the whole, if you review all our wars, never has one been finished in a shorter time than that with the Gauls. Thenceforth they have preserved an unbroken and loyal peace. United as they now are with us by manners, education, and intermarriage, let them bring us their gold and their wealth rather than enjoy it in isolation.

> Everything, Senators, which we now hold to be of the highest antiquity, was once new. Plebeian magistrates came after patrician; Latin magistrates after plebeian; magistrates of other Italian peoples after Latin. This practice too will establish itself, and what we are this day justifying by precedents, will be itself a precedent.

Claudius’ measure met with significant opposition from the Roman nobility. In the Julio-Claudian era this was pretty rare (opposition to the emperor tended to be a very dangerous affectation) so it’s indicative of strong feelings at Rome. It’s conceivable that Claudius’s strong move against Druidism was a political flanking maneuver designed to show that he was not selling out Roman values while inviting the suspect Gauls into the Capitol - setting up a ‘Nixon in China’ moment, Roman style. Cracking down on unpopular practices (particularly on human sacrifice) would be good PR and also offer a chance for Romanized Gauls to demonstrate their civilized abhorrence of “barbaric” behavior in a public way.

_The_ _[Lyon Tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon_Tablet)_ _records Claudius’ decree opening the Roman Senate to Gauls in 48 AD_ 



* Tacitus is, however, probably exaggerating the influence of the Druids in 69: the military leaders of the rebellion were mostly Romanized — they even had their own candidate for emperor: [Julius Sabinus](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/julius-sabinus/).
** The [Roman attitude towards human sacrifice was extremely complex](https://www.quora.com/How-common-was-human-sacrifice-in-the-Greek-and-the-Roman-Empire/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=2c2ac383&srid=zLvM). Leaving aside the question of how much a gladiator-loving society could take the moral high ground, they did view the suppression of human sacrifice as part of their ‘civilizing mission. ’ They always decried it loudly in their enemies —the Carthaginians, the Illyrians, and the Gauls are the most obvious examples — and yet there are attested incidents of the practice at Rome itself even after Claudius’ time.
