The first one is a legitimate myth, the second one was invented, pretty much out of laziness and shoddy research, for the 1981 movie [Clash of the Titans](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082186/). There are no Greek Krakens before the 80’s. The monster which Perseus actually fought was named [Cetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus_(mythology)) (“whale.” or “sea monster”).

_Cetus (“KBTOM”) left. Note lack of resemblance to the creature from the Black Lagoon._
