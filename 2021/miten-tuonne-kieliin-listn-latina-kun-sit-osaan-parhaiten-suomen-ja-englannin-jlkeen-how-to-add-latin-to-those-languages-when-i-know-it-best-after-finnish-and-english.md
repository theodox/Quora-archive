I did get far enough in the Finnish version to (a) recognize it was Finnish (b) guess it was about Latin —- but it looks like somebody added the English translation.

Unfortunately you just lost your best Finnish-Latin resource: [the Finnish state radio used to broadcast a Latin news hour, but the program ended in 2019.](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-48661183) You can get back episodes here: [Nuntii Latini | Audio Arenan](https://arenan.yle.fi/audio/1-1931339)

I don’t know anything about the state of Latin-Finnish textbooks but I’d imagine it’s a smallish market. You might want to try [Lingua Latina per se Illustrata](https://www.amazon.com/Lingua-Latina-Illustrata-Pars-Familia/dp/1585104205), which is written almost entirely _in Latin._ You’ll get illustrated assistance and enough formulaic content that you can probably work through it with no more difficulty than an English speaker would. The LL series was written by Hans H. Ørberg — a Dane who, I suspect, used the “natural language” or “learn in the other language” method in part because the he didn’t have a very large language market for a purely Danish-Latin textbook.

This is an example of _Latina Per Se Illustrata_ . It’s pretty easy to figure out if you’ve got a bit of geography — and along the way you get some verb forms (_est_  = “it is”, _sunt =_ “they are”), prepositions (_in_ = “in”) and conjuctions. The approach is to learn the language like a tourist — through repetition and pattern recognition rather than through formal grammar.
