Modern day Iraqis, particularly in the southern portion of the country, are statistically very likely to be descended from Sumerians — but not exclusively so.

We don’t have much information about how southern Mesopotamia transitioned from Sumerian language and political institutions to [Akkadian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire)ones. It used to be thought that the language switchover — which started place about 4,100 years ago — represented the “replacement” of the Sumerian population with a different people, but nowadays we find that wholesale replacements of existing populations are very rare. You could make an analogy to what happened in, say, France after the fall of the Roman empire: the people at the top changed, and the language of government and trade did as well, but the existing population didn’t just disappear.

The Iraqi population that is believed to be most similar to the ancient Sumerians is the [Marsh Arabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_Arabs), whose [genetic profile](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2148-11-288) indicates a very localized origin in southern Mesopotamia. Iraqi [Assyrians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people) are a fairly homogeneous group, genetically, compared to other Iraqis — they are thought to be descended mostly from the ancient Assyrians whose population centers were in the northern part of Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia has been a crossroads for thousands of years, so it’s not easy to spot a single genetic marker that indicates the original indigenous population — even relative isolated groups like the Marsh Arabs shows the influence of thousands of years of trade, conquest, and peaceful diffusion.
