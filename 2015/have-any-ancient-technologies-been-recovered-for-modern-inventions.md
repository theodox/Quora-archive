The closest thing to a 'lost and recovered' technology is probably [waterproof concrete](https://www.quora.com/What-lost-technologies-did-the-Ancient-Romans-use-but-now-they-have-been-rediscovered-and-improved), which was re-discovered (with some reference to ancient sources, but also with a lot of modern work) in the 18th century.
