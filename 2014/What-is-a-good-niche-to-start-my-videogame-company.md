Anything that you think of a 'mass market' is a high risk venture for a small company just starting out. The 'mass market' - familiar genres and subjects - is very crowded with smart, hardworking folks from all around the world. If you set out to make the next Call of Duty or World of Warcraft without tens of millions of dollars, you'll have a hard time.

But...

There are many smaller markets that are not as swamped and hyper-competitive as the big conventional market. This is why so many successful indie developers seem to come out of left field - the indies you hear of are the ones who found an interesting offbeat niche and really owned it. There are hundreds of indie devs you'll never hear of because they went broke competing with deep-pocketed companies that already know how to please the Best-Buy end of the market. 

Find an underserved niche - ideally, one with a passionate online community that can support you. It could be a less-popular genre. It could be an under-served audience. It could be a strong art style. The key thing is to find something that you want to do (never sign up to make a game you don't want to play!) and also one you think has a natural audience - even if that audience is a few tens of thousands of fans instead of tens of millions. Make a small number of people very happy before you try to make a huge number of people slightly less jaded. 

One nice side benefit of this strategy is that you'll have a chance to learn the technical and artistic ropes with lower stakes and a more encouraging public. 3

Go for the million seller on your _second_ game.
