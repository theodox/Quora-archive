[Pliny ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plin.+Nat.+28.18&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137)quotes a Greek woman named Salpe as recommending using urine as burn cream:

> [urine] should be used as a liniment for sun scorches, in combination with white of egg, that of the ostrich being the most effectual, the application being kept on for a couple of hours.

Urine was a very common medical substance in antiquity â€” for example Pliny also regards urine mixed with ground [vetch](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vetch) as a burn remedy, and he includes it in a variety of poultices and skin treatments.

Evidently [some people still think it works](https://www.thrillist.com/health/nation/urine-therapy-treatments-dry-skin-acne).
