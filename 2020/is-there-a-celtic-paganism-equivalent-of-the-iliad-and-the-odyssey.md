No, not really.

The _need_ has been felt for a long time — that’s what gave us one of the great literary scandals of the 18th century, the famous [Ossian hoax](http://hoaxes.org/archive/permalink/james_macpherson_and_the_ossianic_controversy) in which a Scottish poet named James MacPherson convinced about half of Europe that he had uncovered the work of an anonymous ancient bard. None other than Thomas Jefferson gushed "I am not ashamed to own that I think this rude bard of the North the greatest poet that has ever existed;” other admirers included readers as diverse as Goethe, Napoleon, and sir Walter Scott.

Unfortunately, it turned out that most of "Ossian's" poems were a mishmash of Irish and Scottish stories from several different centuries, strung together by a "translator" with only a rudimentary grasp of ancient Gaelic languages. The allure of a possible Celtic Homer remains so powerful that even today, two and a half centuries after Samuel Johnson first called BS on Ossian there are still periodic efforts to rehabilitate the poems — despite the fact that none of the manuscripts which MacPherson claimed he was “translating” has ever surfaced.

The Irish [Táin Bó Cúailnge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A1in_B%C3%B3_C%C3%BAailnge) is probably the closest match, but it is in prose rather than poetry. It’s generally looser and more episodic in structure than the _Iliad_ and the characters are drawn with less attention to individual personae than in the _Odyssey,_ but it’s a compelling story and it does give a glimpse of a very old Celtic world view.

The Welsh [Mabinogion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabinogion) also offers a very interesting view of some old Celtic stories but (in addition to being prose) it’s ultimately a literary rather than an oral product — it’s got influences from medieval French romances literature and even from the historical tradition of post-Roman Britain (it’s famous for being one of the oldest sources of material related to king Arthur).

So — there’s not really an exact match in terms of form or scale. There’s plenty of interesting pre-Christian Celtic material but it’s generally in different forms, prose, shorter poems, or even things like collections of riddles.
