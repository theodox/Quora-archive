Essentially there would not be any difference for most texts. The real break in the tradition happens later, between the 2d and 9th centuries for almost all of our texts, apart from miraculous flukes like the Dead Sea scrolls.

There are really two independent reasons, so for clarity I’ll cover them separately

__Rare Originals__ 

The Alexandrians didn’t necessarily have the originals themselves. The texts with which they were most obsessed — the Athenian classics of the [Pentecontaetia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecontaetia), the years from 480 to 430 BC — were a century or more old when Alexandria was first built. With handful of famous exceptions, the library contained copies rather than originals.

It’s true that the early library did try quite hard — and sometimes underhandedly — to get hold of original manuscripts. However the best-known example of this shows why those precious originals were so hard to come by. [Galen ](http://www.attalus.org/translate/extracts.html\)tells the most famous story about the tactics which the Ptolemies employed to get their hands on prized autograph manuscripts in his _Commentary_ on Hippocrates (XVII.606)

> This Ptolemy is said to have given sufficient proof of his eagerness to collect old books, by his behavior towards the Athenians. After giving them fifteen talents of silver as a surety, he received from them the manuscripts of Sophocles and Euripides and Aeschylus, on the understanding that he would simply make new copies from the manuscripts, and then promptly return them intact. But after he had produced magnificent new copies on the finest writing material, he kept the books that the Athenians had sent to him, and sent back to them the copies that he had made. He urged them to keep the fifteen talents, and at the same time to receive new copies instead of the old books that they had sent to him. The Athenians would have had no other option, even if he had kept the old books without sending new copies to them, because when they accepted the money, they had agreed that if he kept the books, then they would keep the money; and so they accepted the new copies and kept the money.

Then as now, collectors recognized the value of a rare mss. and were willing to pay handsomely for prized copies. 15 talents was a very significant sum: it’s 390 kg or about 860 pounds of silver — it’d pay for about 135 man-years of skilled labor, or outfit a squadron of warships.

However the contract which the Ptolemies signed — and then violated — shows why it was far from a given that a prized original would end up in Alexandria. Precious rarities were sought after and sometimes fought over, and the Ptolemies did not (apart from a few interludes) have the kind of power over the Greek mainland or Ionia which would have given them easy access to those texts.

The fate of Aristotle’s library illustrates this quite clearly: It was inherited by the family of [Neleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neleus_of_Scepsis) — a favorite student of Aristotle’s successor, Theophrastus. Neleus’ family didn’t share his taste for philosophy — but they knew the books were valuable and so they buried them to escape the attention of a different set of predatory bibliophiles, the Attalid kings of Pergamon. When these books finally resurfaced around 100 BC they were in terrible condition. An Athenian collector bought and restored them as best he could, However the books (and the unfortunate collector, Apellicon) were caught up in [Sulla’s sack of Athens in 86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Athens_and_Piraeus_(87%E2%80%9386_BC)); the books ended up in Rome (the unlucky rescuer ended up dead). The low quality of the surviving texts was notorious in antiquity, despite the efforts of Peripatetic scholars to reconstruct the corpus. But it shows how rarity could just as easily endanger a book — and also that the Ptolemies were not the only, or the most ruthless, collectors in the Hellenistic world.

So, Alexandria certainly took part in the trade in rare autograph manuscripts —but it did not dominate that trade. Not unlike the way antiquities markets have functioned for the last several hundred years, the competition for unique autograph copies included a great deal of idiosyncrasy: the whims of an individual collector, the vagaries of politics, and sheer dumb luck all played a role in figuring out where the originals ended up. It’s quite likely that the villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum contained (and, if scanning techniques continue to improve, may again) a few autographs of [Philodemus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philodemus), due mostly to the fact that Philodemus was a friend of [Lucius Calpurnius Piso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Calpurnius_Piso_Caesoninus_(consul_58_BC)), the owner of the villa.

The survival of an original did not automatically exercise a dominating effect on the quality of the copies in circulation, either. Collectors in antiquity, as in more recent times, were often more interested in the physical object and its safety than in serving scholarship. Here the library — which did have a staff of professional literary scholars in residence — was probably a better steward of rare mss. than private collectors. However even institutions are prone to absent mindedness and institutional rot. We know that the scholarly quality of the library was in decline long before Caesar showed up to burn the place down; You can get something of the flavor from the fact that [Ptolemy Physcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_VIII_Physcon) appointed his bodyguard and chief enforcer as head librarian.

It’s also worth pointing out that Galen’s anecdote shows that copies, like prized collectors items, did circulate privately as well. Books were expensive luxury products but — like Hermes scarves or sports cars — they were part of a busy market. Just before the passage above, Galen describes the famous “ship books” which actually made up the bulk of the Library’s collection:

> Ptolemy the king of Egypt was so eager to collect books, that he ordered the books of everyone who sailed there to be brought to him. The books were then copied into new manuscripts. He gave the new copy to the owners, whose books had been brought to him after they sailed there, but he put the original copy in the library with the inscription "a [book] from the ships".

This scheme worked because books were an ideal trade good in the Hellenistic Mediterranean. Given the trouble and cost of travel, overseas trade focused on items with a very high ratio of value to size: things like jewels, spices, luxury textiles… and books, which were very expensive even when they weren’t originals.

That luxury connection is an important part of understanding the real role of the Library: it was an advertisement for the wealth and cultural cachet of the Ptolemaic dynasty. But building a library as self advertisement was a well known tactic for Greek and Roman aristocrats. Seneca _[(De Tranquilitate Animi, IX)](https://www.stoictherapy.com/resources-tranquility)_ famously complains about wealthy Romans keeping their books in the living room for display, rather than study — and he includes the Alexandrian library itself as the epitome of tacky conspicuous consumption:

> Forty thousand books were burnt at Alexandria. I leave others to praise this splendid monument of royal opulence, as for example Livy, who regards it as 'a noble work of royal taste and royal thoughtfulness.' It was not taste, it was not thoughtfulness, it was learned extravagance—nay not even learned, for they had bought their books for the sake of show, not for the sake of learning—just as with many, who are ignorant even of the lowest branches of learning, books are not instruments of study, but ornaments of dining-rooms. Procure then as many books as will suffice for use; but not a single one for show. You will reply: 'Outlay on such objects is preferable to extravagance on plate or paintings.' Excess in all directions is bad. Why should you excuse a man who wishes to possess book-presses inlaid with _arbor-vitae_  wood or ivory; who gathers together masses of authors either unknown or discredited; who yawns among his thousands of books; and who derives his chief delight from their edges and their tickets?

> You will find then in the libraries of the most arrant idlers all that orators or historians have written—book-cases built up as high as the ceiling. Nowadays a library takes rank with a bathroom as a necessary ornament of a house. I could forgive such ideas, if they were due to extravagant desire for learning. As it is, these productions of men whose genius we revere, paid for at a high price, with their portraits ranged in line above them, are got together to adorn and beautify a wall

In the end it was this competitive luxury market more than any single institution which created the ecosystem in which our texts survived. Collectors like the unfortunate Apellicon, [Marcus Terentius Varro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Terentius_Varro), [Gaius Maecenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Maecenas) and [Herodes Atticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodes_Atticus) amassed substantial libraries all over the Greco-Roman world. To donate a library to the “public” —though that almost always meant the wealthy, literate public and not the ordinary populace — was like building a temple, a theater or a stadium: it was a monument to the prestige and cultural status of the donor. The city of Rome had [at least nine large libraries of which we know ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/bibliothecae.html)— and all of the ones whose origin we know of began with private collections. In the age of manual copying, a single text might only spawn a handful of direct copies every year: books that survived long enough to reach us were, almost universally, “best sellers” not rarities.

__The Great Extinctions__ 

The other thing we can never forget when discussing the transmission of ancient texts is the role of changing technological and cultural circumstances. By definition, every copy of a given book but one would not be original. It’s the fate of the copies which really determines what reaches us. And the gap between us and the ancient world was was a very, very dangerous one for books.

Part of this stems from the fact that even ordinary copies were expensive. A cheap copy of a single scroll of verses, Martial tells us, cost a _denarius,_ that is, a days pay for a carpenter or a soldier. But that meant a complete copy of the _Iliad_ , with 24 scrolls, was nearly month’s wages for a decent copy. Cheaper copies were available but the were less reliable both as textual reproductions and as physical objects with a chance of surviving long enough to be recopied and eventually reach us. Most of our texts won’t have been copies of the cheap stuff.

It matters a lot what you’re copying _on_ . Even decent papyrus, alas for us, is not a particularly durable writing medium. Scrolls help to mitigate papyrus’ tendency to fray and split but regular use would eventually cause a papyrus roll to fail. which meant that an ancient book owner had to decide whether or not to recopy a failing book.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f2a85c184564261af31498fd3722ebf3)

_This amazingly preserved bit papyrus of the Iliad from the British Museum dates from the first century. It shows the characteristic signs of a failing papyrus: the vertical ‘cracks’ as where the matrix is falling apart along the line of one ply of fibers._ 

Around the middle of the second century, the codex — that is, the modern bound book — began to replace the scroll. Codices are a superior way to store words: they have protective covers and they lay flat, which puts less stress on the manuscript leaves. They’re also easier to store and transport than scrolls. So, when the book collectors of the later Roman empire got the point where it was time to recopy their works, the next version would invariably become a codex. If you follow the surviving manuscript tradition of any classical work you’ll see that they nearly begin with something named “codex” and almost never go all the way back to a papyrus scroll. Almost every survival older than the fourth century comes from a fluke, an lucky outlier like the [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls) or the Egyptian garbage dumps of [Oxyrhynchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyrhynchus_Papyri).

Along with the codex (the exact relationship is not really clear) came the gradual replacement of papyrus by parchment. Parchment — as an animal product — is more expensive than papyrus but also far more durable: well prepared parchment, if properly cared for, can last over a thousand years. Thus, it dominates our survivals — if you’re lucky enough to get into a really old library stack you’ll note the distinctive smell that comes from thousand-year-old calf skin. Rare late-antique survivals like the fourth century [Vergilius Romanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vergilius_Romanus) show the amazing durability of parchment. They also show why its so incredibly rare to find manuscripts from the ages of papyrus: put yourself in the place of a late-antique bibliophile with a cabinet full of fraying papyri — wouldn’t you want to replace them with a fresh parchment codex which would survive for hundreds of years, which you could take with you on a trip without a special wooden case, and which you could lay flat while taking notes?

Thus, the shorter lifecycle of papyrus ms and the attractions of the parchment codex spelt doom for most ancient manuscripts. It did not take a dramatic event to wipe out those older generations — it simply took a long millennium in which anybody with an interest in books was looking for an upgrade. Add in the changes in handwriting which accompanied the switch in writing material and many of the older texts were probably no more intelligible to an early medieval reader than this is to most of us:

_This is less than 300 years ago, and it’s in English (it’s a recipe for gingerbread). It illustrates how changes in handwriting over time incline manuscript owners to have important books recopied — a few centuries of changing fashion can render a text very hard to read.

Thus whether you cared for your books as objects or because you wanted to read them, copying over to a new parchment codex made eminent sense. I have once or twice had to deal with priceless original documents (or at least, pricey, impressively old copies thereof) and for any practical purpose I vastly prefer a modern copy. It’s a _thrill_ to hold a 900 year old book in your hand but it’s infinitely easier and less stressful to work with a crappy Penguin classics edition. Most of us are not cut out to be the custodians of irreplaceable objects.

__TLDR__ 

Alexandria never had anything like a monopoly on precious originals — but it did serve as an important source of high quality copies. In that sense it did have an important impact on what we see today. However the real break in the chain of custody — though not, it’s important to remember, in the actual chain of transmission! — for many of these texts happens between about the fourth and the ninth centuries when papyrus scrolls fell out of favor: that period is an evolutionary bottleneck for western texts because it forced owners to make a definitive decision — unfortunately for all too many texts it coincides with a period of political fragmentation and economic retreat which meant that many texts were simply deemed unworthy of preservation.

It’s very unlikely that the survival of the library past [Julius Caesar’s misadventures ](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Julius-Caesar-burn-down-the-library-of-Alexandria/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=0f72f940&srid=zLvM)would make a big difference. The entire region of the city in which the library stood was laid waste in 275 and 297, and then finally overwhelmed in the tsunami of 365. Survival to any of those dates would not really alter equations which dominate the survival of our texts: the interaction between the relatively short useful life of papyrus, the advantages of parchment codices, and the changes in handwriting and style which made texts readable (or not) as time went on.

It’s not impossible that some of our text would have been higher quality — had better originals been somehow made available for the scholarly few, perhaps circulating versions would have been emended in useful ways. On the other hand we know that even the Library in its heyday never succeeded in eliminating the many disputed and dubious bits of Homer. This was an enterprise in which several generations of serious scholars collaborated, but human ingenuity and persistence were not able to overcome human carelessness and sloppiness in that one case. It’s far from certain that the editors would have triumphed in many others.
