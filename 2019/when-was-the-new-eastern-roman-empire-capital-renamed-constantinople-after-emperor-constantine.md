Constantine established his capital in what was then “Byzantion” (or, in Latin, _Augusta Antonina)_ in 330. The project actually took about six years before the official “ribbon cutting” on May 11, 330.

However the name of the city took a long time to settle on Κωνσταντινούπολις_,_ “The city of Constantine,”__ which — tellingly — is a Greek rather than a Latin name. We don’t have an official record of Constantine’s official pronouncement but this was well before Greek became the language of Roman law; he seems to have started off with _Nova Roma_ or “New Rome” in Latin and Νἐα ‘Ρώμη in Greek.

[A variety of other nicknames contend for about a century and a half ](https://www.quora.com/What-was-Constantinople-called-before)before Κωνσταντινούπολις__ won out. Technically the [Patriarch of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch_of_Constantinople) is still Η Αυτού Θειοτάτη Παναγιότης, ο Αρχιεπίσκοπος Κωνσταντινουπόλεως, Νέας Ρώμης και Οικουμενικός Πατριάρχης, “His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch"
