Only very distantly. They are both part of the Indo-European family so they share a (long lost) common ancestor in [Proto-Indo-European,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language) which is the common ancestor of most languages of Europe, Iran, Russia, and northern India. Punjabi is in the [Indo-Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Iranian_languages) family (in purple on the map) and Latin in the Italic group; to find a common ancestor you have to go pretty far back, at least about 5,000 years. As you can see from the chart below Punjabi is more closely related to Greek than Latin.

All Indo-European languages share some features in sound, grammar and vocabulary, though often those shared features are only obvious to experts.
