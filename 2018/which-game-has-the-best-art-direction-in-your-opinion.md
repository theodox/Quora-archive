“Best” is obviously subjective, but I’m happy to share my personal preference.

Since game art is always a complex dance between aesthetics, gameplay, and technological limits it’s extremely hard to compare things just one the basis of the end results — the best team in the world in 1995 (_full disclosure: my first year in the industry)_ could not match the graphics horsepower available to any first-year game student making a mobile game on Unity or Unreal today. I do, however, think you can have an interesting argument about how perfectly a given game realized the technical possibilities of its day and genre.

For my money, the most delicate balance of artistic vision, technological prowess and gameplay is still [the original PS2 version of ICO](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/ico/).

Obviously, a lot has changed in terms of delivering graphics in the nearly two decades since ICO came out. But ICO was a gigantic leap forward in the direction of deliberate art direction rather than just ‘cool graphics.’

The game’s composition and lighting and color palette were carefully designed to work together, creating a haunting atmosphere that complemented the game’s story and gameplay. At a time when most game teams were obsessed with simply pushing more triangles, Team ICO invested heavily in lighting and light-scattering; this created a painterly texture which stood out brilliantly from the usual mess of swimmy pixels that was common around the year 2000. Every choice of content was deliberate and impactful; the wan, ethereal coloring of the silent AI companion and the hero’s makeshift costume evoked a haunting, dreamlike atmosphere that seemed a million miles away from the harsh, hard-visuals of most gen-6 console games.

Are there games which look better today? Absolutely; we have tools that were hard to imagine in 2001. But I can’t think of a game which made more perfect use of the resources at hand to tell a story or set a mood than ICO.
