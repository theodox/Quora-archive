As several answers have noted, the Druids represented the __focus of opposition to Roman rule__ .

In Gaul and Britain political fragmentation was the norm. The Romans generally had no problem finding kings or chieftains who wanted to play along — working with Rome provided a powerful endemic wars between neighboring peoples. The Druids, on the other hand, were more or less “international” — they provided the closest thing to a national consciousness in the Celtic world. For that reason, there are several well attested examples of Druids organizing or raising support for anti-Roman uprisings, most famously during the revolt of Julius Civilis in the year 69:

> 3 In the meantime the news of the death of Vitellius, spreading through the Gallic and German provinces, had started a second war; for Civilis, now dropping all pretence, openly attacked the Roman people, and the legions of Vitellius preferred to be subject even to foreign domination rather than to obey Vespasian as emperor. The Gauls had plucked up fresh courage….. But nothing had encouraged them to believe that the end of our rule was at hand so much as the burning of the Capitol. "Once long ago Rome was captured by the Gauls, but since Jove's home was unharmed, the Roman power stood firm: now this fatal conflagration has given a proof from heaven of the divine wrath and presages the passage of the sovereignty of the world to the peoples beyond the Alps." Such were the vain and superstitious prophecies of the Druids.

[Tacitus, Histories](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Histories/4C*.html) IV.54

Granted, this is a Roman piece and reflects the Roman outlook: it may or may not be accurate as history but it definitely reflects what the Romans thought was going on.

Druidic practice also involved three aspects which the Romans always feared and disliked in foreign religions.

They were __intensely secretive__ : Druids were forbidden from committing their teachings in writing, and the did much of their education in private face-to-face meetings. The Roman state frowned on organized private meetings of any kind; this was one of the excuses used for the persecution of Christians, but also for strict regulation of the worshippers of Bacchus and Isis.

Druids also practiced various kinds of __divination__ . Astrologers and fortunetellers of all kinds were also regarded as suspect, precisely because predictions of change were frequently the catalyst for political unrest — as the quote from Tacitus shows quite clearly.

To top it off, the practice of __human sacrifice__ , which was spread pretty widely in the Celtic world, didn’t help much either: the Romans believed that forbidding human sacrifice was an index of their civilizing mission.*

Interestingly, the final crackdown on the Druids was a bit more complex than straight up imperial politics. When[ Emperor Claudius banned druidism](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Emperor-Claudius-ban-druidism) he wasn’t just stomping on Celtic culture: he was also providing political cover for __his plan to allow Gauls to sit in the Roman Senate__ . He had to look tough on an unpopular aspect of Celtic culture in order to grant Gauls (at least, wealthy ones) political equality with Romans.
