# How likely is it to find the lost books of Livy or one of Cicero's works that haven't survived in an unexcavated area in the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum?

It’s not impossible, but it’s not likely either. There are about 1800 scrolls in the collection, which sounds like as lot — however that’s a lot fewer than 1800 books in the modern sense: depending on the balance of genres it could easily be fewer than a hundred complete works when deciphered.

The library — at least the fragments we have successfully transcribed — seems to be heavily tilted towards philosophy (and thus, for that era, towards Greek texts) so the likelihood of finding a Livy is low. The known contents look to run about 7:1 Greek to Latin ( 836 to 122) 

Cicero might be more likely than Livy — his philosophical inclinations are well known. On the other hand he was not particularly aligned with the Epicurean school which is well represented in the surviving scrolls so he might be an unlikely candidate.

On the other hand surprises are always possible. PH 1067 — thought to be some kind of senatorial speech — was recently identified as a fragment of [a history by Seneca](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342854317_A_'historical'_find_from_the_library_of_Herculaneum_Seneca_the_Elder_and_the_Historiae_ab_initio_bellorum_civilium_in_PHerc_1067). Only a tiny handful of the Latin scrolls have rendered readable so there may be all sorts of interesting discoveries waiting to be unrolled... assuming our technology for unrolling them continues to advance.

You can get a sense of what we do (and don’t) know about the library’s contents by searching the list [here](http://www.chartes.it/index.php?r=document/index&segnatura=&lingua=&conservazione=&svolgimento=&argomento=&autore=&svolgitore=&disegnatore=&rangeannostart=&rangeannoend=&rangelargstart=&rangelargend=&rangealtstart=&rangealtend=) (in Italian, but not hard to decipher).
