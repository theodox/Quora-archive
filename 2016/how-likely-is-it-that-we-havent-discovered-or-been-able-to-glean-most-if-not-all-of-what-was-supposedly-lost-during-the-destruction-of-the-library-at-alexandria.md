# How likely is it that we haven't discovered or been able to glean most if not all of what was supposedly "lost" during the destruction of the Library at Alexandria?

Even though I’m a big fan of antiquity, I have to say that the Library has to be the the most over-hyped cultural product of the Greco-Roman world. The scientific value of the Library of Alexandria is [vastly overestimated](https://www.quora.com/Which-ancient-librarys-destruction-represents-the-greater-historical-loss-between-Alexandria-and-Baghdad),usually by people who have only a very hazy idea of what the Library actually was and what it contained.

What very few of the — what can we call them? _Bibliomaniacs?_ — want to admit is that __libraries — as individual collections of words on paper — don’t really mean much.__ 

An individual library only matters when its contents are irreplaceable, but “irreplaceable” means two very different things: a book can be irreplaceable because it’s a _precious_ artifact — say, Abe Lincoln’s copy of the the Illinois state code with his notes in the margin; or a book can be irreplaceable because it’s the _only one_ of its kind.

And that latter kind happens only when the book is, by definition, obscure: either forgotten, or simply unwanted.__Books reproduce by utility: if people want a book, they’ll get copies of it.__ 

So when a book is priceless for reasons of sheer rarity, it’s generally because there is not enough demand to keep it in circulation.The Alexandria Library had a lot of books of the first kind: rare and precious manuscripts that any classicist would kill to get their hands on. But the idea that it contained lots of super-secret technological wizardry is just hype. For modern scholars and specialists, a complete copy of the play that took third place in the Dionysia of 383 BC would be a treasure beyond price. But in Ptolemaic Alexandria, it held a place no more special than the [third-runner-up for the Oscars in 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Racket_(1928_film)) does in the mind of the modern moviegoing public.*

__The world before printing is a brutal, Darwinian struggle for memetic survival__ . Lots of of books died during the centuries in which the Library moldered into obscurity. Well [over 90% of all the books written in antiquity are lost](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-books-that-no-longer-exist-yet-are-quoted-by-other-ancient-books/answer/Steve-Theodore). They are all tragedies for obscurantists like me: but it’s very unlikely that the lost works contained wonderful secrets and tremendous advances: if they _had_ , they would have existed in copies all over the ancient world, not in just one building.

As the [answer linked above notes,](https://www.quora.com/Which-ancient-librarys-destruction-represents-the-greater-historical-loss-between-Alexandria-and-Baghdad) only a handful of technical topics got serious attention from the people who ran the Library: medicine, math and astronomy were prestige subjects, fit for a gentleman: mere _techne_ , grubby stuff like naval architecture or engineering or animal husbandry weren’t classy enough to merit literature. The Library had very little concern for technology.

In any case, the technical secrets of antiquity really were deliberately kept secret: they were _trade_  secrets. The Library was not a place that would have happily admitted tradesmen — but in a world without patent law, the clever tradesman would not have been too eager to publish his secrets in any case. That secrecy really did kill a lot of useful knowledge, because a trade secret dies even more easily than a roll of papyrus.

So the library’s contribution to the history of technology is negligible. It died because people didn’t care enough to preserve what it really did contain: obscure minor poets, the less popular productions of Greek tragedy, philosophical works from sects nobody cared to recall, and innumerable details of history and diplomacy that I’d give my left arm to read but which don’t, in fact, enable anybody to levitate or communicate with Alpha Centauri.

_This is what the Library really contained: it’s a collection of scholarly footnotes about different editions of Homer (from the_ _[Oxyrhynchus Papyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyrhynchus_Papyri)_ _)_ 



* Case in point: the third runner up for the 1929 Oscars existed as only a single copy until it was restored about 20 years ago. It would not have taken much for it to disappear like so much of the works of, say [Georges Méliès](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s)
