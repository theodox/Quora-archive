You can learn a lot by following Quora’s own [Emmanuel-Francis Nwaolisa Ogomegbunam](https://www.quora.com/profile/Emmanuel-Francis-Nwaolisa-Ogomegbunam), who is a very talented writer about African matters, particularly but not exclusively West African material. He’s also got a Patreon here, which deserves more support: [Emmanuel-Francis Nwaolisa is creating Articles, Essays on African History. | Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/emmanuelfrancis)
