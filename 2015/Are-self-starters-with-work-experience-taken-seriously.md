This really depends on the field. Some business or technical cultures respond very positively to evidence that somebody is internally motivated, and self-taught; others are heavily oriented towards formal credentials. 

 In my business (video games) there seems to be a strong correlation between the size of the company and the emphasis on credentials; big studios, where the hiring is often done by HR people rather than technical people, seem to find credentials an efficient way to screen their large pools of applicants, while smaller companies - especially those where employees have to have a broader skill set rather than deep specialization -- seem less worried about the paper trail.
