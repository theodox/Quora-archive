The distinction between a primary and a secondary source is really about the _reader_ , not the _writer:_ it concerns how and why we’d cite a text rather than some quality inherent in the text itself.

To take a famous example:

The writings of Cicero provide a lot of commentary on aspects of life in late Republican Rome. One historian might read ___[In Verrem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Verrem)___ , the speech he gave impeaching the corrupt Roman governor of Sicily, in order to get a sense for things like how the Roman laws on official corruption were interpreted, or what the social attitudes of a Roman jury were like. That’s using _In Verrem_ as a primary source, since it’s a piece of courtroom oratory.

In the next cubicle, however, another historian might be poring over the long list of charges the Cicero reported (it’s quite a tabloid-esque indictment) as part of a chapter on the history of Sicily in the late Republic. This second historian is using Cicero as a collator and interpreter of (presumably) facts, not as an unconscious participant in events. In this case, he’s a secondary source — he’s got both information to share and an agenda which the reader needs to understand in order to assess the value of his assertions.
