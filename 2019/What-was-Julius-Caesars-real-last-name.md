Actually it was _Julius…_ at least if by ‘last name’ you mean ‘family name.’

In the classical Roman naming scheme there were three names — Caesar’s full name was Gaius Julius Caesar. The first name was the ___praenomen___  or personal name, the one you used with your friends and family — Marcus or Lucius or in this case Gaius (if you were one of the later children you weren’t guaranteed a good praenomen: “Quintus” for example means “born in Quintilis”, ie, “in July” — before Quinitilis became “Julius” in honor of Caesar). The second name was the family name, the ___nomen___ __ proper: Caesar was a member of the [Julian family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(gens)), one of the oldest ones in Rome. The third name was the ___cognomen___ , a kind of official nickname. Because there were not that many family names to go around — only a couple of hundred — it became common for different branches of the more important families to add an extra name to distinguish themselves from one another. So, our Gaius Julius Caesar had distant cousins like Lucius Julius Bursio and Gaius Julius Mento — technically part of the same family, but only in the same way everybody in Korea with the family name “[Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_(Korean_surname))” is part of the same family.
