# The Pelasgians are frequently mentioned in Classical and Hellenistic Greek literature as a non-Greek people who lived in Greece in the far past. How likely is it that these references are distorted memories of the Mycenaean era Greeks?

There are a lot of tantalizing hints in the bundle of issues connecting Pelasgians, Ionians, and Mycenae. But — reader beware — the links are murky and have to be regarded as interesting guesses rather than settled facts.

Also, since it’s so confusing, it makes for a longish answer.

__Pelasgoi = ?__ 

Pelasgian eventually became the “generic” word for pre-Greek (which is to say, non-Greek-_speaking)*_  inhabitants of the Greek world. It’s quite frequently used that way in modern times as well.

However it’s unclear if that’s how it the word _started out_ . It might be an exonym applied by Greek speakers (from _pelas ge,_ “close-by-land”) or it might be a Greek rendering of a name from another language.

However it started, subsequent Greek usage is confusing and unsystematic. Homer connects the Pelasgians in passing with Dodona (in Epirus), with Argos, and with Crete — but he also has Pelasgians fighting as Trojan allies, listed in between the Trojan contingents from Asia Minor and their allies from Thrace. These Trojan-allied Pelasgians usually have recognizable Greek names (though then again, so do most of the royal family of Troy).

A few centuries later, Herodotus implies that there are Pelasgoi living all over the north Aegean region: in Greece, the islands and Asia Minor. Most famously of course [he claims (1.57) ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/1B*.html#56)that the Athenians were originally Pelasgoi who adopted the Greek language:

> What language the Pelasgians spoke I cannot accurately say. But if one may judge by those that still remain of the Pelasgians who dwell above the Tyrrheni in the city of Creston — who were once neighbours of the people now called Dorians, and at that time inhabited the country which now is called Thessalian — and of the Pelasgians who inhabited Placia and Scylace on the Hellespont, who came to dwell among the Athenians, and by other towns too which were once Pelasgian and afterwards took a different name: — if (I say) one may judge by these, the Pelasgians spoke a language which was not Greek.

> If then all the Pelasgian stock so spoke, then the Attic nation, being of Pelasgian blood, must have changed its language too at the time when it became part of the Hellenes. For the people of Creston and Placia have a language of their own in common, which is not the language of their neighbours; and it is plain that they still preserve the fashion of speech which they brought with them in their migration into the places where they dwell.

He also references a Pelasgian - Ionian connection in Xerxes naval roster: ([7.94)](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/7B*.html#94)

> The Ionians furnished a hundred ships; their equipment was like the Greek. These Ionians, as long as they were in the Peloponnese dwelling in what is now called Achaia, before Danaus and Xuthus came to the Peloponnese, as the Greeks say, were called Aegialian Pelasgians; they were named Ionians after Ion the son of Xuthus.

> The islanders furnished seventeen ships; they were armed like Greeks; they also were of Pelasgian stock, which was later called Ionian by the same right as were the Ionians of the twelve cities, who came from Athens. The Aeolians furnished sixty ships; they were equipped like Greeks; in former days they were called Pelasgian, as the Greek story goes.

That second passage rather awkwardly contrasts the Ionians and the Greeks (ie ὡπλισμένοι ὡς Ἕλληνες, “they were equipped like Hellenes”) which is an interesting word choice. You can try to read that as if the equation is _Ionians = Pelasgians = “not real Hellenes.”_ 

__Are Ionians Hellenes?__ 

Of course, if you’re familiar with Greek linguistics, the question of whether the Ionians are true Hellenes seems almost perverse: the Ionic dialect is the closest continuer of the language of Homer — and Herodotus, after all, wrote in Ionic.

However you can fit a story around the contrast between Ionian and “Greek” _if_ you believe in the theory that the linguistic map of Greece is ultimately the result of the so-called [Dorian Invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_invasion) at the end of the Mycenaean era. In this view the “Hellenes” are really the Dorian-speakers who overthrew — or at least replaced — the Mycenaean kingdoms and the Ionians would be the heirs of the dispossessed. In this connection it might be important that while Herodotus wrote in Ionic dialect his home town of Halicarnassus was originally a Dorian colony: there might be a vestigial hint of Dorian suprematism in his contrast even though Herodotus is a famously an Athenophile.

Most archaeologists do think that Athens shows the greatest continuity of habitation out of all the mainland Mycenaean sites. The Mycenean fortifications of the acropolis shows no signs of violent destruction or desertion — unlike other centers such as Mycenae, Pylos and Thebes. Thus if you accept the Dorian Invasion hypothesis Athens becomes the last holdout of “Mycenean” civilization. The city’s historic links with the settlement of Ionia might reflect its role as a kind of refugee port funneling “Mycenaean” survivors to safer homes in Asia Minor as the Greek mainland fell increasingly under the rule of Dorians. In historic times there are plenty of instances of Dorians ruling over restive non-Dorians in Greece — places like Sicyon (where an anti-Dorian revolution in the 7th century turned the tables) and above all Messenia, where the Dorian Spartans ruled over the non-Spartan and presumptively “Mycenaean” Messenians.

So, you can view Herodotus’ inconsistent ideas about who’s a real Hellene as a transitional moment between a (Dorian-centric) view of “Hellenes=Dorians” and the later view of Dorians, Ionians and Aeolians as all equally “[children of Hellen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellen#:~:text=In%20Greek%20mythology%2C%20Hellen%20(%2F,of%20the%20adjective%20%22Hellenic%22.)”. After all, the familiar (to us) grouping of all these groups into “Hellenes” took a long time to settle in, at least according to [Thucydides (1.3)](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&query=Thuc.%201.3&getid=1):

> Before the Trojan war there is no indication of any common action in Hellas, nor indeed of the universal prevalence of the name; on the contrary, before the time of Hellen, son of Deucalion, no such appellation existed, but the country went by the names of the different tribes, in particular of the Pelasgian. It was not till Hellen and his sons grew strong in Phthiotis, and were invited as allies into the other cities, that one by one they gradually acquired from the connection the name of Hellenes; though a long time elapsed before that name could fasten itself upon all. …. It appears therefore that the several Hellenic communities, comprising not only those who first acquired the name, city by city, as they came to understand each other, but also those who assumed it afterwards as the name of the whole people, were before the Trojan war prevented by their want of strength and the absence of mutual intercourse from displaying any collective action.

If we accept a gradually widening definition of “Hellenes”, then the ambiguities in Herodotus become easier to grasp. “Pelasgian” is transitioning from what’s essentially a Greek tribal name into a word for more exotic non-Greeks as Mycenaean-language-inheritors and the Dorian-language-inheritors creolize their respective speeches into something they see as dialects of a common language.** Event today the line between dialects and languages is famously muddy : is Scots a language or a dialect of English? And would the answer be the same in 1600 as it its today? So the confusion becomes more natural because we’re dealing with a process, not a fixed definition.

It’s worth pointing out that — Herodotus and Thucydides aside — most Greek writers talk about Pelasgians as if they were at least ambiguously Greek (the [wiki page ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelasgians)has a pretty good run down of the sources). The identity of Pelasgian = pre-Greek-population only really became a standard explanation in the 19th century when mass-migrations and invasions were in vogue as explanations for everything.

…at least, all this is _one_  way to read this murky and ambiguous evidence.

__TLDR__ 

There’s a good case to be made that the “Pelasgian” language of the early Athenians and other non-Dorian Greek groups might very well be the archaic Mycenaean Greek of Linear B. The “adoption of the Hellenic language” that Herodotus refers to could be the process that pushed this speech closer to the Doric speech of Thebes, Argos, and Sparta. The clearly non-Greek Pelasgians of the fifth century BC (in Herodotus, Thucydides, and a few later writers) are a separate group which somehow got tagged with the same name. We are, after all, talking about a literary tradition which had trouble distinguishing Thebes in central Boeotia from “Thebes” in Egypt.

The factual parts are pretty simple: several writers identify Pelasgians as Greeks and the Mycenaean->Athenian->Ionian relationship is at least consistent with archaeology and has echoes in Greek tradition. The main reason for hesitating is the inconsistency: Herodotus (and some later writers) clearly label Pelasgoi as “barbarians.”

To some degree the question boils down to what’s more likely: were there an awful lot of non-Greek speakers in Mycenaean-era Greece (non-Greek communities do show, occasionally, in Linear B tablets)? Or were the fifth-century barbarian Pelasgians just lumped under the same name as a Mycenaean-Greek people for some reason, leading many subsequent readers to assume all Pelasgoi were barbarians?***

In any event, the confusion is very old. Ovid, who of course is way too late to be a primary source, does actually have the Greek army at Troy calling _itself_  Pelagian:

> Thestorides 'vincemus'; ait, 'gaudete, Pelasgi!
Troia cadet, sed erit nostri mora longa laboris,'

> “Rejoice, Pelasgians! We shall conquer!” said Thestorides,
“Troy will fall though it its fated to be a long labor for us.”

Which illustrates that the ambiguity of Pelasgianism was still unresolved half a millennium after Herodotus. The identification of the Pelasgoi is a minor theater in the long, drawn out and apparently endless war over the origins of the Greek language and the family relations between its dialect communities.



* One never-to-be-forgotten point which emerges from this is the difference between language and genetics. Herodotus, after all, is saying that the uber-Greek (and as we’ll argue below, also Mycenaean) Athenians _became_  Greeks by changing language. Language is not the same thing as ethnicity despite the endless amount of sniping it generates in the Balkans to this day.

** John Chadwick, who was one the great drivers of the decipherment of Linear B, claimed to be able to distinguish two distinct dialects within the tablets. He thought the “Dorian Invasion” was a myth designed to disguise the replacement of a Mycenean upper class by a (proto-Dorian) Mycenaean lower class. More on that hypothesis [here](https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/found-the-dorians/)

*** Here it might be worth [reconsidering the question of whether Trojans were really “barbarians” either](https://www.quora.com/What-language-did-Homeric-Trojans-speak/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=e9ccb965&srid=zLvM) — or were they also in an ambiguous spot on a language continuum? Homer has Pelasgians and Trojans with Greek personal names fighting on the same side…
