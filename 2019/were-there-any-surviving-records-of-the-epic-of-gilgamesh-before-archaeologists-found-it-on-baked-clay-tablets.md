You’ll usually heard it said that there was no memory at all of Gilgamesh after the loss of the cuneiform literary tradition.

However that’s not exactly correct. The arc of the story was definitely forgotten — but it left a handful of traces which were never quite fell out of circulation in the intervening centuries.

__Aelian__ 

The third-century Roman author [Aelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius_Aelianus) collected interesting tales. In his book _On The Nature of Animals_ , he includes this tale in passing:

> When Euechorsos was king of the Babylonians, the Chaldeans predicted that a grandson would be born to his daughter, and he would deprive his grandfather of his kingdom. Fearing this thing, and if I may utter something of a joke, he acted as Acrisius toward his daughter; for he ordered the strictest of watches kept over her. But yet the daughter (for fate had outsmarted the Babylonian king) gave birth to the child, having become pregnant by some uncertain man. But out of fear of the king, the guards threw the infant headlong from the citadel where the daughter was imprisoned. In truth, an eagle, seeing the falling infant with its very sharp eyes, before he could be dashed against the ground, flying under received him on his back, and transporting him to some garden put him down with the utmost care. Moreover, he who cared for the garden, when he saw the beautiful little boy, loved him, and reared him; and he, called __Gilgamos__ , was the king of the Babylonians.

The story doesn’t have any obvious connection to the epic as we know it — but given the longevity and numerous variations of the tale in the cuneiform texts, it’s entirely possible that _some_  Gilgamesh adventure included this episode.

__The Book of the Giants__ 

Another reference that was “lost” for a long time is in the [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://www.academia.edu/382953/Gilgamesh_the_Giant_The_Qumran_Book_of_Giants_Appropriation_of_Gilgamesh_Motifs). Gilgamesh shows up as one of the named giants in the [Book of Giants](http://www.gnosis.org/library/dss/dss_book_of_giants.htm). Another of the giants is named Hobabish, which many scholars think is a version of [Humbaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humbaba) — the monster of the cedar forests who Gilgamesh slays in Lebanon in the epic.

__Syriac literature__ 

The Syriac theologian [Theodore Bar-Konay](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bar-konay-theodore-kewanay-saturninus-not-koni-according-to-cambridge-university-library-ms), writing around 600 AD, lists a king Gligmos as the last of a line of kings which — in his chronology — would have ended around the time of the biblical patriarchs.

__Berossus the Babylonian__ 

Around 280BC, a Babylonian priest in the Seleucid Empire wrote a book in Greek which presented a summary of his people’s view of the world and its history. We know him as [Berossus](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/berossus-babylonian-4th-3rd-century-priest-chronicler-whose-work-has-some-bearing-on-iranian-history) but his real name was probably Bel-reushu.

Unfortunately we’ve only got small fragments of the work today — but they include one of the most famous parts of the Gilgamesh story. Here’s part of his account of early human history:

> After the death of Ardates, his son Xisuthrus reigned eighteen sari. In his time happened a great Deluge; the history of which is thus described. The Deity, Cronus, appeared to him in a vision, and warned him that upon the fifteenth day of the month Dæsius there would be a flood, by which mankind would be destroyed. He therefore enjoined him to write a history of the beginning, procedure, and conclusion of all things; and to bury it in the city of the Sun at Sippara; and to build a vessel, and take with him into it his friends and relations; and to convey on board every thing necessary to sustain life, together with all the different animals; both birds and quadrupeds, and trust himself fearlessly to the deep.

> Having asked the Deity, whither he was to sail? he was answered,"To the Gods:" upon which he offered up a prayer for the good of mankind. He then obeyed the divine admonition: and built a vessel five stadia in length, and two in breadth. Into this he put every thing which he had prepared; and last of all conveyed into it his wife, his children, and his friends.

> After the flood had been upon the earth, and was in time abated, Xisuthrus sent out birds from the vessel; which, not finding any food, nor any place whereupon they might rest their feet, returned to him again. After an interval of some days, he sent them forth a second time; and they now returned with their feet tinged with mud. He made a trial a third time with these birds; but they returned to him no more: from whence he judged that the surface of the earth had appeared above the waters. He therefore made an opening in the vessel, and upon looking out found that it was stranded upon the side of some mountain; upon which he immediately quitted it with his wife, his daughter, and the pilot. Xisuthrus then paid his adoration to the earth: and having constructed an altar, offered sacrifices to the gods, and, with those who had come out of the vessel with him, disappeared.

“Xisuthrus” is how Berossus rendered [Ziusudra,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziusudra) the Sumerian (!) version of the flood-story analog of Noah. It’s a sign of Berossus learning that he uses this version rather than [Atra-Hasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atra-Hasis), which is the name he probably would have used in conversation.

This tiny fragment of the old epic remained in circulation because Christian theologian [Eusebius of Caesarea](http://www.attalus.org/armenian/euseb2.htm) used it as a confirmation of the flood story in the Bible.

__Arabic sources__ 

The Arabic cleric [Al-Suyuti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Suyuti), around 1500, used the name “Jiljamish” for a demon.
