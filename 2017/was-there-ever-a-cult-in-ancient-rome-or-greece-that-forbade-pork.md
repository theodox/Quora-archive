No. In fact Jewish abstention from pork was regarded as quite puzzling by Greek and Roman observers. Ethnographers noted it, alongside other “odd” customs like Egyptian animal worship or Scythian tattos. The most common Greek position was that the taboo had to be respected, because it was traditional — but it was a crazy thing to do; that usual Greek posture towards foreign customs since at least the days of Herodotus

Since it was not a common practice, some Greek observers tried to guess — usually quite wrongly — at reasons for the Jewish custom. Plutarch, for example, [has a dialogue in which a bunch of Greeks sit around debating whether the Jews won’t eat pork ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0312%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D1)because they worship pigs (like Egyptians worshiping cats or crocodiles) or because they hate pigs (like Persian magi, who apparently hated water rats).

[Tacitus](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/tacitus/tacitus-on-the-jews/) — writing in the interval between the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and the tremendous violence of the Kitos War — includes the pork taboo in the list of “new customs” which set the Jews apart from other people: not, in his view, a positive trait. Petronius claimed the Jews worship a _porcinum numen_ , a pig-spirit.
