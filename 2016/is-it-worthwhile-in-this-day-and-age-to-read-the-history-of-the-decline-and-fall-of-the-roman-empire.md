It really depends what you are after.

If you're reading for pleasure, Gibbon’s prose is majestic and vivid. It's also a window into the world of early modern scholarship, which is fascinating in its own right — this was the period that invented, among other things, the crabby academic footnote. As an 18th century man of letters his Latin was far more fluent than most modern scholars’, which gives his relations with his Latin sources an intimacy that many modern writers can’t match (his Greek, however, isn’t as good). And above all, Gibbon was a past master of the kind of aristocratic irony that we degraded denizens of the twitter era can only wonder at: his put-downs are unsurpassed. If some of his prose style rubs off on you, be grateful.

On the other hand if you’re reading to actually learn about the way the Roman empire ended it’s probably not the _first_  book you ought to read.

Gibbon was writing more than a century before the modern historical profession really took shape, and he doesn’t share a modern historian’s desire for critical distance. The same ringing judgments which make his writing so enjoyable often disguise the fact that he didn’t always care to understand many of the people he wrote about: if you weren’t an enlightened prince or an aristocratic man of letters (emphasis on the _man_ ) Gibbon didn’t have much time for you. He was very strong on the classic ‘battles and treaties’ side of history, and was informed on the seamy side of church history as only a talented hater can be — but he was pretty much completely blind to many other important aspects of the times: the changing role of women, the complexities of the late-Roman economy, the stirrings of nationalist passions under the superficial guise of imperial order and the rapid assimilation of non-Romans into the Roman world. His treatment of Byzantine history is occasionally inaccurate (he’s never at his best when the sources are Greek rather than Latin) and it’s depressingly unsympathetic and condescending.

Gibbon’s an amazing writer and a brilliant, though far from impartial, scholar. You can trust him to provide at least a defensible — or at least, a decently footnoted — account of events, which already puts him ahead of many historians of his own day and later. He’s just not very sensitive or perceptive about aspects of human life which take place outside the throne rooms and battlefields he really cares about. To be fair, this was also the bias of most of his literary sources; he lived before scientific archaeology and the rediscovery of Roman-era papyri in Egypt which made a huge difference to our understanding of the social and economic life that goes unrecorded in the ancient chronicles. But in the end I’m not sure he would have cared had the material been available; like many of the _philosophes_  he admired, Gibbon’s Olympian point of view was also the point of view of privilege with a capital P.

For all those reasons if you’re in it for the history and not the literature, I’d recommend reading Gibbon after you’ve spent time with more modern scholarship. If you’ve got the basics down — and have enough modern perspectives not to accept his 18th century agendas as if they were the laws of physics — it’s a great read… in smaller bites. _Decline and Fall_  is a big book. A lot of it is devoted to details that modern readers will not particularly care about; the careers of short-lived usurpers or the scandals of imperial courts. Since the book is more or less a chronological retelling (until the last few volumes, when his distaste for the Byzantines in particular led him to start skipping around) it’s sometimes a bit of a slog, particularly if you’re not already familiar enough with the characters and situations and have to follow every plot twist in detail.
