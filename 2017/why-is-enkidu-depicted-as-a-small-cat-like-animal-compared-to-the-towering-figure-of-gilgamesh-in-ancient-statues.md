That’s not Enkidu, thats an actual lion cub. It’s a conventional feature of many images of Gilgamesh, probably reflecting a story or proverb that has not come down to us. It may be an Assryrian addition to the story, I think all of the known examples are fairly late and the heavily-muscled style is characteristically Assyrian. In other Assyrian art, [lion hunting is a pre-eminent sign of royalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_Hunt_of_Ashurbanipal).

Otherwise, Enkidu is depicted as human, on the same scale as Gilgamesh — it’s a reflection of his role in the stories as Gilgamesh’s only true equal. The usual version of the story has him a “shorter in stature” than Gilgamesh, and he’s often described as being like a “younger brother” — but they’re on the same plane, unlike say an Egyptian frieze with a Pharaoh towering over waist-high courtiers.

Here’s an Assyrian example:

And an Akkadian one from at least a thousand years earlier:

_Gilgamesh (left) and Enkidu (right) fighting wild animals_ 

Enkidu is sometimes depicted, as here, with horns and hooves to reflect his origins as a “wild man” raised by animals. This example is Sumerian, from Larsa, and that may be a tradition limited to Sumerian or Sumerian-imitating images.
