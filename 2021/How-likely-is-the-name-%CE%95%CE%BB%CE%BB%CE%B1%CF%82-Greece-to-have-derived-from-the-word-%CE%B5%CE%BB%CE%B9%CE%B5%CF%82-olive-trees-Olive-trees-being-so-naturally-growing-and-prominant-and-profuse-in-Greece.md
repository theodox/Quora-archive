# How likely is the name "Ελλας" (Greece) to have derived from the word, "ελιες" (olive trees)? Olive trees being so naturally growing and prominant and profuse in Greece.

It’s unlikely. If nothing else a Greek speaker would immediately hear the aspiration: ἐλαία starts with a soft vowel sound: _e-lai-a_ whereas Ἑλλάς starts with a [rough breath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_breathing), a semi-consonantal sound similar to “H”: _hel-las._ Modern Greek has lost the sound but in antiquity the distinction between ἐ and ἑ was noticeable enough to be worth recording.

Historically the Greeks were unanimous in ascribing Ἑλλάς to Ἕλλην “[Hellen](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0104:entry=hellen-bio-1)”, the mythological son of Deucalion — the Greek version of Noah, survivor of a great flood which wiped out most of the human race.

The original Hellenes were a tribe in Thessaly:

> Now all those again that inhabited Pelasgian Argos, and dwelt in Alos and Alope and Trachis, and that held Phthia and Hellas, the land of fair women, and were called Myrmidons and Hellenes and Achaeans

> νῦν αὖ τοὺς ὅσσοι τὸ Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος ἔναιον,
οἵ τ᾽ Ἄλον οἵ τ᾽ Ἀλόπην οἵ τε Τρηχῖνα νέμοντο,
οἵ τ᾽ εἶχον Φθίην ἠδ᾽ Ἑλλάδα καλλιγύναικα,
Μυρμιδόνες δὲ καλεῦντο καὶ Ἕλληνες καὶ Ἀχαιοί,

Iliad 2.685

(“Pelasgian Argos” is not the more famous one in the Peloponnese ). Although olives are grown in Thessaly, they don’t have the same central place in the Thessalian world: Thessaly is famous as one of Greece’s few horse-rearing regions, and its economy tended to center on grain, cattle, and sheep.

_A Thessalian coin, with the common Thessalian motifs: A horse and Athena in her warrior guise_ 

There’s no universally accepted etymolgy for Hellen or Hellas; a lot of linguists try to derive the root from a different Greek tribal name, Σελλοί or “Selloi” — but there’s no solid evidence for that and some linguists think the Σελλοί got their name from Ἑλλάς instead of the other way around. There’s not a dominant candidate for an Indo-European root word in any of these, despite many guesses.
