Sulla’s reputation among Romans who portrayed themselves as upholders of aristocratic tradition — the _[optimates,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimates)_ __ his nominal friends, and also the people who left us most of our written sources— was mixed at best. Even in antiquity, he found few passionate supporters and a lot of critics on his natural side of the political spectrum.

Pompey and Crassus both started their careers as Sulla’s lieutenants in the civil war against Marius, but in their later careers they were at pains to distinguish themselves from him. Cato, the aristocrat’s aristocrat, is said to have [fantasized about associating Sulla as a teenager:](http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/cato_you.html)

> Cato was then in his fourteenth year, and seeing the heads of men said to be of great distinction brought [to Sulla’s house], and observing the secret sighs of those that were present, he asked his preceptor, "Why does nobody kill this man?" "Because," said he, "they fear him, child, more than they hate him." "Why, then," replied Cato, "did you not give me a sword, that I might stab him, and free my country from this slavery?" [The tutor] hearing this, and at the same time seeing his countenance swelling with anger and determination, took care thenceforward to watch him strictly, lest he should hazard any desperate attempt.

Cato later started his career by prosecuting many of Sulla’s informers. Cicero (never much of a warrior) served in Sulla’s army as a young man — but he inaugurated his political career with a [daring defence of Sextus Roscius,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Roscio_Amerino) who was framed for murder by one of Sulla’s trusted henchmen. Although the speech was delivered while Sulla was in power, and Cicero avoided blaming the murder directly on the the dictator, it was nevertheless understood by contemporaries as a dangerous display of independence. Later in life he was in the habit of [using Sulla’s name as a verb](http://Cicero uses Sulla’s), meaning essentially “to act like a tyrant.” When he faced off against the populist uprising of Catiline, he still used the conservative dictator Sulla as bogeyman. The conspirators, [he claims,](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0019:text=Catil.:speech=2:chapter=9&highlight=sulla)

> must raise Sulla from the dead… But, I warn them, let them cease to be mad, and to think of proscriptions and dictatorships; for such a horror of these times is ingrained into the city, that not even men, but it seems to me that even the very cattle would refuse to bear them again.

The most favorable things said about Sulla generally fell into the familiar political category of “he’s a son of a bitch, but he’s _our_ son of a bitch.” Conservative opinion never really approved of Sulla, though it often sought to bracket it with the populist violence of Cinna and Marius. After Caesar’s victory Cicero occasionally muttered that at least Sulla had been willing to retire voluntarily — hardly an enthusiastic defense, but an example of the way in which partisan and moral considerations tended to become confused in late-Republican Rome. Nonetheless Sulla remained byword for tyrannical excess on his own side of the political spectrum..

Caesar, on the other hand, had legions (literally and figuratively) of enthusiastic supporters who were unbothered by his own proscriptions and crimes. More importantly, his epigone Augustus created a new, durable political structure which had almost three generations of control over Roman political discourse — the better part of a century in which criticism of Caesar (whether the original or his inheritor, who quite deliberately used the same name) was a extremely dangerous. There may very well have been a arch-aristocrats who were willing to embrace Sulla as a counterpart to Caesar and Augustus — but if they existed, they kept such thoughts wisely to themselves.

It is worth pointing out that Caesar — in contrast to both Sulla and to the younger Octavian — seem to have genuinely disliked racking up a large body count among his political rivals. Even his political enemies generally admitted his _[clementia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clementia)_ _,_ his willingness to go easy on defeated enemies: Cicero knew it was politically astute — he called it _insidiosa clementia,_ “treacherous kindness,” — but he recognized it and availed himself of it.

So it’s not entirely an accident that Caesar has been claimed — usually on a pretty flimsy basis — as a spiritual ancestor by many modern political movements who choose to regard him as embodying a vital historical principle. The fact that the principles he’s supposedly embodying are often diametrically imposed (he’s been frequently fingered as both a proto-Lenin and a proto-Mussolini) don’t change the fact that his generally positive reputation in antiquity and down the succeeding centuries makes him an attractive totem.

Augustus, of course, had the luxury of a long reign in which he had both absolute power and lot of talented writers providing propaganda on his behalf. His earlier crimes were forgotten in the long, relatively benign years of his successful reign. Ironically this atmosphere was a good one for the story of Sulla’s crimes to move from political partisanship to moral examplar: decrying the horrors of Sulla’s dictatorship could be slotted into either praise of Augustus’ pacific reign or criticism of tyranny that could be plausibly distinguished from criticism of any _living_  ruler. It may be that a few of the authors who were denouncing Sulla’s crimes had someone else in mind…. but they were wise enough not to make it too obvious.

We can see that there were still some pro-Sullan sources floating around in the Augustan period. Livy, for example, used pro-Sullan sources for parts of his account of the war between Marius and Sulla. [But even he had this to say:](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/livy/livy-periochae-86-90/)

> Sulla drove Carbo out of Italy, having defeated his army at Clusium, Faventia, and Fidentia, and fought, with the Samnites (the only Italian nation that had not laid down its weapons yet) near the city of Rome at the Porta Collina, and having restored the state, soiled his beautiful victory with a greater cruelty than anyone had ever displayed.

So, ultimately, we are recycling a judgement which was almost universal within a few years of Sulla’s death and which, after more than a century of repetition drowned out whatever other versions might have circulated.. Sulla was condemned by Sallust and Cicero alike — political opponents, but both hugely influential writers. Pompey and Caesar accused each other of wanting to imitate Sulla. Two centuries later Plutarch, the most influential biographer of antiquity, cemented the schizophrenic image of the young war hero turned bloody tyrant into the form that reaches us. We can try to come up with analogies but (unlike Caesar, or Augustus, or Cato, or Pompey) nobody close to events was willing to go to bat for Sulla in antiquity.

_We don’t have any direct evidence that portrait heads resembling this one are really Sulla — but it’s been the most common identification for centuries, based on the literary character._
