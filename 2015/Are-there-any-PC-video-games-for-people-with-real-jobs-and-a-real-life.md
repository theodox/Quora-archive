Judging by the comment, this is about finding games with a low investment model -- stuff that can be picked up and put down pretty easily and played in short bursts instead of long grinding sessions and that doesn't require serious skills training .

Realistically, the PC is not the best place for those kinds of games -- easy-in, easy out games are much more common on consoles and tablets. You can probably find some of what you're looking for by seeking out console ports -- there are several on your list -- because they will have been designed with that in mind. You'll miss out on some PC specific things -- the UI will be much simpler and the range of interactions narrower - but the time required will be less.

You can also avoid the first problem by limiting genres. The comment mentioned a lot of RPG style games, but the RPG model is mostly built up around gradual development mechanics, so most RPGs run long: the core fans want to tweak out their builds and get exactly the right skill sets which takes a lot of experimentation and discovery time. So RPGs are not likely to fit your bill, unless you want a real casual version of the genre. You will find plenty of examples but you will not find many with realistic graphics or super-high production values: it takes a ton of money to make something like Skyrim and it's hard to make that kind of money back on the "softcore" player -- the casual crowd tends to prefer cuter and more graphic styles. 

One thing PCs have, which consoles and tablets don't, is lots of turn based games. These have a natural on-off mechanism which is good for folks with short time budgets. They come in all sorts of varieties from the deep (Civilization V) to the very deep (Europa Universalis) to the much more casual (ports of boardgames or lighter strategy games from Gangs of Deadville to Greed Corp).
