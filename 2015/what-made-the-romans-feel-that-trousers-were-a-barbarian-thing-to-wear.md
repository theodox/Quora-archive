It's definitely a classic example of cultural chauvinism in action. Our way or the highway (or the _via claudia)._ 

 Complaints about pants show up as early as Cicero (Caesar's conquest of Gaul was a major source of pants-wearers; as usually happened, soldiers picked up the habit on compaign). Honorius banned them in the 420's but the bans were reiterated down until the 9th century in Byzantium. Honorius, at least, also organized an anti-German pogrom (see [What were the sackings of Rome in the year 410 by the Goths and Vandals like? Were they organized or did they just ride through the city slashing, burning and pillaging?](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging), and in Byzantium the bans had an element of resentment against Westerners. 

To be fair, the toga had a very close association with Roman citizenship and mores. The _toga virilis_  was the mark of adulthood - putting one on for the first time was an important rite of passage for adolescents. The _toga praetexta,_ with a broad purple border,__ was the symbol of magistrates and priests. Certainly there was a lot of tradition behind it -- even after pants took over, robes remained important ceremonial dress for for magistrates, priests and kings.
