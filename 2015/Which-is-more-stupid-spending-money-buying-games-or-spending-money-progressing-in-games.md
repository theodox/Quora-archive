Poorly done or exploitative designs literally require that you pay to progress. In those kinds of cases, walk away: speaking as a game dev, I'd say that very few designers or developers make games like that for any other reason than milking players of money. The likelihood that the underlying gameplay of a monetization treadmill game will be any good is quite low.

That said, for the majority of games, the difference between paying up front and paying over time is not as big as you'd think. Paying up front is easy to understand, because it's similar to buying a book or a pair of shoes. However it has two big drawbacks: A lot of people expect their games to be free, and even people who are willing to pay don't want to pay full price for games they may not finish (fewer than 15% of games are played to completion, on average ).

 Pay-to-play was created because of software piracy. The overwhelming majority of all video games played on earth are not paid for: even very successful games can see piracy rates of higher than 90% on the PC; mobile games are less pirated but among people with unlocked smartphones or tablets piracy also dwarfs purchase. Obviously, this is different on hardware-locked console platforms. That's why so many developers like consoles! The pay-to-play mechanics evolved in Asia, where the piracy rate for traditional PC market was approaching 100% of all the games played -- Asian devs needed to find a way to get some return on their time. In-game purchases took much longer to catch on in the US, Japan, and Europe where the piracy rates were "only" in the 80-90 % range. 

When the model started catching on in the west, it came with a big side benefit: it broke down the price barrier for many consumers by setting a lower 'try it and see' threshold. A lot of people won't try your game if it costs $20 or $60 just to see if they like it. A 'free' game with in-game purchases is just a more granular way of pricing than a free demo that encourages you to buy a full price game after a level or two. I'm not sure why the psychology of buying games works as it does, but it's statistically true that you'll do better financially if you give away the game and allow people to basically buy it in small pieces than if you sell it in one large chunk. You can make more money buy getting a little bit from a very large number of customers than a lot from a small group.

The short version is: figure out if you really want to see more. If you do, paying a little to see more of the game is a reasonable transaction. If the game feels like it's exploiting you - constantly nagging you, making it impossible to have fun without paying constantly -- move on. There are loads of games which aren't exploitative, so there's no need to waste time on ones that are. When you find a game where paying doesn't feel like a chore, everybody wins.
