Obviously, there’s a lot to unpack there.

I think my taste — which might not be really mass market, alas — is to lean heavily on how _freaking weird_  the ancient Greeks really were. Their reputation for “wisdom” and “science” and “democracy” (all scare quotes intentional) has a lot to do with modern efforts to find a pedigree for what are often pretty recent ideas.

Ancient Greece was a very alien place in all sorts of ways: alongside the beginnings of rationalism and political egalitarianism you had slavery, superstition, and an attitude towards relations between the sexes that would make Saudi Arabia look like a feminist collective. You had great art but also great poverty: your average Greek was lucky to get fish for dinner every week or two, and (apart from some pretty nasty sausages) meat might only be seen five or six times a year, in the context of big religious festivals. It was perfectly ordinary for a wealthy man to walk naked through the streets discussing philosophy. And the most famous and influential woman in town would probably be a foreign prostitute. _The past_ , as the saying goes, _is a different country; they do things_ __differently__ _there._ 

This is a great setting for a fantasy novel — it’s a rich, complicated and (lucky for you!) a very well researched place, with some amazing detail that can be a great catalyst for storytelling. There’s a ton of great work out there but [24 Hours in Ancient Athens](https://amzn.to/32eJG8e) is a good introduction for a non-academic; [Courtesans and Fishcakes](https://amzn.to/3J0r0KE) goes deeper with more attention to scholarly nuance.

If you want a “low magic” setting you can have characters that simply act as if conventional Greek beliefs about magic and divine intervention were real. Since Greek magic didn’t rely heavily on pyrotechnics — no “I cast magic missile!” here ! — you can create a story where the incantations, sacrifices and omens work, or at least seem to work, but without bending the laws of physics.

For a “high magic” setting the challenge would be to find a way to wrap it that was not just Dungeons & Dragons in a toga. The Greeks themselves often acted as if it was their neighbors who knew all about magic: the Egyptians were supposed to be otherworldly and wise; the Babylonians were masters of astrology; the Scythians were scary cannibals and were-wolves.

Gene Wolfe’s [Latro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009E6VSBG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) series is a great example of the low-magic approach: it sticks very closely to a Greek world view centered on omens, mysterious influences, and ambiguous divinities that do things for very inscrutable reasons — and pretty much everything in there is really coming from primary sources (speaking of which: the Latro series is a love-letter to [Herodotus](https://amzn.to/30GcTc0), the most interesting and garrulous of the ancient Greeks, and an incredible goldmine of story ideas)

On a more mundane level, Harry Turtledove’s [Menedemus](https://amzn.to/3e5GcaQ) books offer a pretty down to earth look at day-to-day life that can be very suggestive.

The queen of Greek-inflected romance (not fantasy) is [Mary Renault](https://www.amazon.com/Mary-Renault/e/B000AP5EFQ?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_3&qid=1639812395&sr=1-3), who was very deft at extracting drama from real historical events and pressing it into the service of (not-super-explicit) gay love. And that’s a thing to consider: an accurate Greek setting would impose some serious obstacles to romance of the boy-meets-girl variety unless the girl was a slave or a prostitute or perhaps an especially liberated Spartan of the upper classes. Respectable Greek women didn’t get out much until the later Hellenistic era, when money and colonial conquests eroded the old-fashioned sex-segregation rules. You can get some idea of the flavor from the Roman era novel set in Greece known as the [Golden Ass](https://amzn.to/3FaQP8a) (which incidentally includes a magical transformation as a key plot element).
