Here’s a 6th century snapshot, a fragment of the [Madaba Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madaba_Map), which was originally done some time after the 540’s.

In keeping with the map-making conventions of the time the top of the map is _east_ , not north, so the large street clearly visible in the center of the city is actually the [Cardo](http://www.israelinsideout.com/Things-to-do-in-Jerusalem/the-cardo-the-ancient-heart-of-jerusalem.html), the main north-south artery of most Roman cities. You can see a couple of notable locations nearby : ΑΚΕΛΔΑΜΑ ([Akeldama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akeldama)), ΒΕΘΩΡΩΝ ([Beit Horon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beit_Horon)). The Roman street grid is clearly superimposed over the remnants of the destroyed Jewish city, still visible in the form of the diagonal way at the top (more or less El Wad haGai street today).

The Cardo was the main street of the city, both sides were a covered arcade providing shelter for shops and pedestrians. It was a big street, 25 yards wide.

_A modern model of the Byzantine city, located at the church of_ _[Saint Peter in Gallicantu,](http://www.visionsoftravel.org/jerusalem-oskar-schindler-and-saint-peter-in-gallicantu/)_ _looking south along the cardo (seen from the left side of the mosaic map above). The large building to the right of the Cardo is the_ _[Church of the Holy Sepulchre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre)_ _(begun by Constantine, but evolving over time); the one to the left at the top is the_ _[Nea Ekklesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nea_Ekklesia_of_the_Theotokos)_ _(built by Justinian in the 530’s)._ 

One interesting thing to note is that the Temple Mount is not really visible on the map — late Roman Jerusalem is based on the Roman city built under Hadrian (and which had been quite thoroughly sacked by Titus) rather than any of the earlier iterations. In this period the former Temple area was basically just ruins.

Missing from the map, but probably still present in Constantine’s time, is Hadrian’s Roman forum, which would have been south of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (the inverted-L shape in the map is probably where the mosaicist tried to depict it). There was an east-west _decumanus_  crossing the _cardo_ at that point — but it’s not obviously visible in the map; it’s probably just south of where the Mosque of Omar is today, ending at the Jaffa gate.

The best literary evidence for this period is the [Itinerarium Burdigalense](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itinerarium_Burdigalense), a travel guide written by a Christian pilgrim from Gaul around the year 333. It's got a fairly detailed description of the city’s topography, at least as pertains to pilgrimage sites and biblical history; there’s an [English version here](http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/pilgr/bord/10Bord07aJerus.html).

There is a lot of detail ail about Constantine’s church in Eusebius’ [Life of Constantine, Book III](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/25023.htm), starting at heading 25
