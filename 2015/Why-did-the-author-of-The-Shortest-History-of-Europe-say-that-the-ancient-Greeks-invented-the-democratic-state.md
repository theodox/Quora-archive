The question details say “_The origins of democracy lay in the army”_ 

If that's what they wrote, they are stretching a point pretty thin.

In most early iron age cities -- in Greece, but also in Italy, Phoenicia and western Asia Minor -- the city depended on a militia for defense. In most cases, these cities were too poor to provide arms and equipment, so the militia included only those who were wealthy enough to provide their own armor and equipment. Most of these cities had some limited form of voting -- for magistrates, for declaring war, sometimes to make laws -- but the voting was limited to the militia class and, therefore, to the rich.

The Athenian democracy was the result of the reforms of the [reforms of Cleisthenes](http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_democracy_development?page=4) in 508 BC or thereabouts. The Athenians overthrew the tyrant Hippias and reorganized their government, giving all free-born males an equal share in the government. All offices except for military commands were assigned by lot for one year, and all laws were passed by majority vote of the whole citizen body -- the _demos --_ which did not have a property qualification (although it was not open to slaves or women). This was recognized at the time as very radical, and was very controversial.

It is actually true to say that Athenian democracy had its roots in the _navy._ The navy needed rowers, and it paid them -- it became, in essence, a big public jobs program. During the [long war with Sparta](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/449362/Peloponnesian-War), when an aristocratic group tried to take over the city the solidly democratic navy returned from campaign to overthrow the aristocrats and restore the democratic government.

While there are certainly earlier forms of government which involved voting (there's clearly some form of consultative city assembly in the story [Gilgamesh and Agga of Kish](http://www.piney.com/BabGilgAgga.html), 3,000 years earlier) there is no record of any earlier system which extended direct participation in government as widely -- even today, our elections involve about half the eligible voters and only elect representatives (themselves chosen from a tiny group, pre-screened by fewer than a quarter of the electorate).
