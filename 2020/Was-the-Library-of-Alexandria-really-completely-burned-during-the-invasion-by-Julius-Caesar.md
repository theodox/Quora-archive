The strictly correct answer is “we don’t know for sure,” because the extent of the damage is only known retrospectively.

The strongest statement is Aulus Gellius, writing almost 200 years after Caesar, who says:

> an enormous quantity of books, nearly seven hundred thousand volumes, was either acquired or written in Egypt under the kings known as Ptolemies; but these were all burned during the sack of the city in our first war with Alexandria, not intentionally or by anyone's order, but accidentally by the auxiliary soldiers

Cassius Dio, writing around the same thing, also says basically the same thing.

However, earlier writers closer to the event gloss over the destruction. Caesar’s official account of the battle makes no mention at all — though it expends a suspicious amount of energy explaining how fireproof Alexandria was. We do know that Antony stole about 20,000 scrolls from the library of Pergamon as a gift for Cleopatra and a replacement for the lost library— though there’s no discussion of the fate of those scrolls after Octavian’s conquest, and no later sources allude to an unusually large collection in Alexandria after that.

So, the evidence suggests a total destruction but the evidence isn’t contemporary. It’s possible that, say, large portions were looted (books were an expensive commodity) rather than destroyed, and eventually the dissolution of the institution wss blamed on a folk memory of the fire rather than a sober accounting. The clarity of what Dio and Gellius say is hard to discount but they are quite removed from the events.

There were of course always books — Alexandria was always the “literary capital” of the Greco-Roman world — but the evidence certainly suggests that after Caesar’s war in 47BC there was nothing special about Alexandria’s collection of books compared to those of other cities.
