Well, for a given value of “good idea”… Multilingual institutions definitely benefit from a neutral, reference language — it’s easy for people representing different language communities to walk away from an “agreement” with very different ideas about what has been actually agreed to. There’s a reason almost every international system evolves a _lingua franca,_ whether it’s Aramaic, Greek, Latin, French, Arabic, Urdu, or whatever.

On the other hand, a language needs to be rooted in some kind of larger reality to make a good diplomatic go-to. Latin _was_ the language of international law and diplomacy in Europe until the latter 17th century, when it was displace by French — primarily because Louis XIV and his armies loomed over the continent to a degree not seen since Charlemagne and it was suddenly a very good idea to know French. Technically, the nations of Europe could have used Persian as a reference language instead of French — but it would not have been a practical choice.

The ascendancy of English in the EU reflects the power and influence of the US in the post WWII era. There are some cheap anti-American points to be scored by switching to Latin; there’s even a reasonable case to be made that it’s a return to the EU’s roots (at last as long as you aren’t Norway or Sweden). At least some of the infrastructure needed to promote the language already exists.

However, the costs involved would be astronomical — to be anything more than a weird bureaucratic quirk you’d need to convert the international language of European business to Latin too, which would touch the lives of so many people that the costs are impossible to calculate. While I’d be more than happy to cash in on the big Latinity bucks that would ensue, I somehow doubt it’s going to happen. If I had to bet, I’d say the EU will switch to Chinese before it reverts to Latin.
