# The Neo-Babylonian Empire succeeded the Neo-Assyrian Empire, but isn't it more accurate to say that it was also succeeded by the Median Empire and the 26th dynasty of Egypt?

The Babylonians inherited the core of the Mesopotamian - Aramaic cultural complex. Their primary sphere of influence was in Mesopotamia and Syria, what you might call the “cuneosphere” — places where the Akkadian language tradition was the dominant high culture. Neo-Babylonian imperial “style” relied very heavily on deliberate references to this tradition, including the resurrection of very old art styles and archaic language: Babylon went out of its way to portray itself as the home of the Akkadian cultural tradition.

_This map, for the Assyrian reign of Ashurbanipal, shows the distinction between the core provinces (in dark green) and foreign territories or protectorates (in light green). The Babylonian empire would end up comprising most of the area here shown in dark green along with the yellowish regions of Chaldea and Babylonia.

By contrast, the other breakaway parts of the Assyrian empire were places that were less closely tied to the Akkadian-language heartland. Most of the lands that ended up in Median hands was part of the Assyrian periphery: places like Anatolia, Urartu and the Iranian lands to the east where Assyrian political power was important but where local cultures remained very distinct.

The Egyptians regained their freedom — and, briefly, their imperial buffer zone in Canaan — but again this was an area where the underlying cultures were only loosely tied to the Akkadian heartland. Ironically they were the last allies of the Assyrians: Egyptians stood shoulder to shoulder with the last Assyrian armies at [Carchemish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carchemish) in 605. Their help. however. failed to stop the Babylonians and they were soon confined to their own borders.

So: it’s certainly true that the Medes, Babylonians and to some degree the Egyptians divided up the corpse of the Assyrian empire between them. However the heart of the old Mesoptamian cultural zone passed almost whole into Babylonian hands. The Akkadian political and literary traditions remained vital to the Babylonians and their subjects, although the new dynasty made a conscious effort to portray themselves as restoring an ancient order which the “upstart” Assyrians had defiled. Until the days of Cyrus the great most observers of the international scene would have agreed that the it was the Kings of Babylon who deserved the old Assyrian title: “_King of Sumer and Akkad,_ _[King of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Universe)_ .”

Cyrus, evidently more modest, retained the title to Sumer and Akkad but only claimed the [four corners of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Four_Corners), and not the entire universe.
