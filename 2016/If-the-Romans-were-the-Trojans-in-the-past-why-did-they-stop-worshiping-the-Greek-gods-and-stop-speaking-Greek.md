# If the Romans were the Trojans in the past, why did they stop worshiping the Greek gods and stop speaking Greek?

First off, there is a big and ultimately never-to-be-removed question mark about the question of the historicity of the Trojan War traditions and their relationship to Roman origins. The skeptics have been proved wrong pretty spectacularly a couple of times -- until Schliemann [dug up Troy](http://cerhas.uc.edu/troy/q415.html) in the 1880's almost nobody believed that the _Iliad_  was anything other than a fable, but nowadays the majority position is that there is _[a nugget of historical truth at the core of the Iliad](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-archeologists-think-that-the-Trojan-War-happened)_ _._  I'm personally inclined to think that there is probably a historical connection underlying the Trojan refugee story as well... just not precisely the one depicted in the _Aeneid_ . On the other hand ancient history is all about probabilities, not certainties.

___edit___ _: I had originally linked an article which tries to derive Etruscan from Luwian, the regional language near Troy; but_ _[Thomas Wier](https://www.quora.com/profile/Thomas-Wier)_ _in the comments seems quite certain that reference is bogus. However there’s another Near East > Etruscan theory, the_ _[Tyrsenian hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrsenian_languages)_ _, which also suggests that Etruscan is related to a different language family in western Asia Minor._ 

Assuming -- and it's still got to be labelled an assumption -- that there's some limited factual basis for all this you can see a pretty simple pattern for it all by looking at how the Greeks dealt with their neighbors.

Greek contact with Italy started in earnest around the 8th century BC -- right around the time when the Homeric poems took shape (and roughly 400 years after the consensus date for the fall of Troy.) The Etruscans and the people who would eventually become the Romans got their letters from the Greek cities of Campania and plenty of other trade goods as well. By the 6th century Etruscan tombs are full of Greek-style goods and, significantly, of Trojan War scenes:

_Achilles sacrificing a Trojan prisoner at Patroclus' funeral - from an Etruscan tomb, 4th c BC_ 

Now, Homer’s poems generally leave the impression that the Trojans are not Greeks, though a counter case can be made. But, as Dimitra correctly points out, he was already showing the later Greek habit of simply assigning other people’s cultural practices Greek names. The head of your pantheon must -- by definition -- be Zeus under another name; your love goddess is probably Aphrodite, your warrior might be Ares or Hercules (This is why the "Pillars of Hercules" are in Carthaginian territory -- these must be Phoenician stories about [Melqart](https://www.ancient.eu/Melqart/) that have been 'back-ported' to Hercules and entered the Greek canon. This habit of simply renaming foreign gods is so pervasive that in classics it has its own name: the _[interpretatio graeca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretatio_graeca)/)_ _._ 

In this frame of mind, Homer can happily say that the Trojans prayed to Zeus or had a _Palladion_ for Athena. You or I, though, seeing the same events might never assume any connection at all to Greek culture or religion.

Skip ahead a few centuries to Italy and the same thing happens again. It's really quite hard to tell if how much the Roman and Greek pantheons really overlapped: by the end of the Republic the identification of both sets of deities in the minds of educated people was almost total and completely automatic. Add that Greek habit of insisting other people's religions are just yours under a different name to the Romans' cultural inferiority complex and naturally both sides are pleased to agree that Jupiter was Zeus, Minerva was Athena and so on -- regardless of how things might have looked 500 years earlier.

Of course the interesting wrinkle is that (in this reconstruction at least) the Romans are _not_ really Trojan refugees: if anyone is, it's the Etruscans. Given that the Etruscans ruled Rome for some centuries before the city rose to prominence, though, it's not hard to imagine some of that origin story rubbing off on the newly-minted Romans. Or, equally likely, both Romans and Etruscans bought in to the the Greek point of view and they deliberately took some native tradition and shoe-horned it into the Trojan war narrative to help locate themselves on the Greek cultural map.

Either way, the narrative version in the Aeneid is unlikely to be literally true. However it’s not a wild guess to think it does reflect real contacts between Italy and Western Asia Minor in the Bronze Age. The cultural continuity in both Homer and Virgil is an illusion, though, born of the _interpretatio Graeca_  and the huge loss of continuity between the end of the Bronze Age and classical times.
