For a long time the 'first pharaoh' was believed to be [Menes](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Menes), who shows up in Egyptian king lists, in the Egyptian writer [Manetho,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho) and in the Greek history of [Herodotus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus) Traditionally Menes (or _Min_  or _Meni_  in some sources) united Upper (southern) and Lower (northern) and established the basic outlines of Egyptian government that would last for the next 2500 years. His reign is usually dated some time around 2900 BC.

However, nobody has ever found direct evidence of king with any of those names; nowadays we tend to think that "Menes" is a half-legendary figure created by later Egyptian writers trying to make sense out of contradictory stories and evidence.

Modern scholars have found archaeological evidence for several different kings who might possibly be the basis for the Menes story. Because much of this evidence comes before Egyptian writing evolved into its familiar form, we don't know as much as we'd like about these pre-Pharaonic rulers.

This fellow is known to us as [Scorpion I,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion_I) although the name is a modern one assigned on the basis of the symbol associated with with him -- true writing was still in its infancy. He reigned some time in the 32d century BC (ie, about 5300 years ago).

We know about him primarily from a pair of [carved mace-heads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion_Macehead#The_Major_Scorpion_macehead). One depicts a figure wearing what would later be the known as the White Crown of upper Egypt; the other shows a figure wearing something that looks like the Red Crown of lower Egypt. That suggests that Scorpion may have controlled both halves of the country making him a good candidate for the role of first Pharaoh.

Another more well-known candidate for the role of Menes is [Narmer,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer) who seems to have ruled around a century after Scorpion. The famous [Narmer Palette ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer_Palette)is a very striking example of early Egyptian art in what would come to be the classic style.

Narmer is clearly depicted here and in other sources as king of both upper and lower Egypt and is frequently identified as 'the first pharaoh'.

Egypt was inhabited for a long time before the Pharaohs. Distinctive 'Egyptian' traits start to show up as early as [Naqada culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqada_culture), around 6500 years ago. Some symbols from this period eventually formed the basis of Egyptian hieroglyphs; as you can see, well before Narmer and Scorpion the Egyptians already had important political traditions such as the two crowns, and religious traditions (note Horus, the falcon, on the Narmer palette). Already in this period Egyptians were trading for good from as far away as Afghanistan .

_The blue in this statuette is lapis lazuli, which could only be gotten from Afghanistan, 3000 miles away. Around 3600 BC._
