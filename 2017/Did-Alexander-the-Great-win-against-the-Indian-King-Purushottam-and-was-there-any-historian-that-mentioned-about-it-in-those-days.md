If you’re referring to the king usually anglicized as [Porus,](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/porus/) then the traditional version has always been that Alexander defeated and captured Porus in a hard-fought battle at the river Hydaspes (the modern Jhelum, more or less). After the battle Alexander befriended Porus, who retained his kingdom as a vassal of Alexander’s. There’s a modern theory that the post-battle friendship is a story made up to excuse Alexander actually _losing_  to Porus, although there’s no surviving evidence. Since Alexander continued eastward after that battle, rather than turning back, the modern version seems unlikely.
