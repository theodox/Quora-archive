Not really - certainly not by the standards of his era.

Alexander’s two worst war crimes were the destruction of [Thebes](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/diodorus/the-sack-of-thebes/) in 336 and [Tyre ](https://www.ancient.eu/article/107/alexanders-siege-of-tyre-332-bce/)in 332. The survivors of both of these cities were enslaved en masse, and both sites were repopulated by others.

These two conquests were, however, unusually harsh for Alexander. His treatment of conquered people was noted by his contemporaries as particularly chivalrous. For example, he [captured the Persian queen mother and royal harem](http://quehttp://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/royal-bonds-how-mother-wife-and-daughter-darius-iii-became-family-alexander-021139) at the battle of the Issus, and treated them with great deference. They retained their Persian households and guards, and Alexander made a point of offering them royal honors whenever he visited. Eventually the Queen mother, [Sisygambis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisygambis) referred to Alexander as her “son” and he called her “mother”.

This was part of his overall policy of incorporating conquered peoples into his armies, a brand of imperialism he copied from the Persians. He found it more efficient to co-opt local elites into allegiance than it was to subject them to brute force. The most famous example is how he treated the defeated Persians themselves: after the death of the Persian emperor Darius (murdered by his own Persian noblemen) Alexander incorporated Persians into his army at all levels. This culminated in a [very public mass-marriage](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/arrian/anabasis/the-weddings-in-susa/) between his Macedonian commanders and Persian noblewomen intended to help unite the Persians and Macedonians as a single people.

_Alexander marries Persian princess Stateira to unite the Macedonians and Persians (this painting was made as an allusion to a different political marriage,_ _[that of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa](http://historyandotherthoughts.blogspot.com/2015/04/maria-theresa-of-spain-first-wife-of.html)_ _in 1660)._ 

Alexander’s generous policy did not outlast his brief time on the throne. The rival generals who carved up his empire after his death were much less interested in running their empires in partnership with the indigenous people.
