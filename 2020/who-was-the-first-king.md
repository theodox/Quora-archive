The oldest example of a named king who we’re sure is historical is [Scorpion I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion_I), a very early Egyptian king in the ballpark of 3150 BC. He’s not as ‘pharaoh’ — that title is almost two thousand years in the future at the time of Scorpion I’s reign.

We don’t know much about him. Even the name is really more like a “logo” than an inscription — Egyptian hieroglyphs would not become capable of writing real sentences for another 500 or so years. However the symbol is used in enough places that we’re reasonably certain its a way of asserting royal authority.
