Large parts of modern Romania were part of the Roman empire, but not the entire modern country. The Romans conquered the independent kingdom of [Dacia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacia)after two wars in the years 101–2 and 105–6. This was an extremely lucrative conquest because of the region’s huge resources of gold and silver: the Roman triumphal celebrations lasted an unprecedented four months

The Roman province of Dacia was mostly located in what is today the Romanian regions of [Transylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvania), [Oltenia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oltenia)and the [Banat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banat). The Roman provinces of [Moesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moesia) also included parts of modern Romania, particularly modern [Muntenia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muntenia)and (Romanian) [Dobruja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobruja).

The exact relationship between the modern Romanian identity and ancient Rome is _heavily_ debated (the [Wiki page ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_Romanians)gives a rundown on the competing theories; you can also get the flavor in [this Quora question](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-origin-of-Romanians-so-controversial-Are-they-descendants-of-local-Romanized-Dacians-Are-they-medieval-immigrants-from-the-Balkans?ch=10&oid=52603698&share=eb75ee3f&srid=zLvM&target_type=question) and [this one](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-modern-day-Romanians-are-descendants-of-the-Dacians?ch=10&oid=46381243&share=02c05bfd&srid=zLvM&target_type=question)). However what’s hard to dispute is that the modern Romanian language is strongly connected to Latin. This localized version of Latin emerged from the interaction of indigenous people and the Roman state over a long stretch of time — including a long time after the Roman army withdrew from to the southern shore of the Danube in 271. The Danube frontier remained heavily militarized into seventh and eighth century, and the Latin-language culture of the Roman army extended through the regional trade networks and the vestiges of old Roman settlements well outside the Roman (or later, Byzantine) political control.

So, to answer the question precisely: modern Romania wasn’t “founded” by the Romans, but large parts of its territory were Roman occupied, and the broader Roman influence in the central Balkans was a key contributor to the modern Romanian language. How that translates into the identity of modern Romanians beyond all that is… complicated.
