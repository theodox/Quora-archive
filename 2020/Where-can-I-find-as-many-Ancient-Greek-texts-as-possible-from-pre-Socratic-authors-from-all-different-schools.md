The standard collection of all the known Pre-socratic texts is available in a few places online, such as [here](https://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/Die_Fragmente_Der_Vorsokratiker.pdf.) (in Greek with German notes).

The most modern English edition is [The Texts of Early Greek Philosophy: The Complete Fragments and Selected Testimonies of the Major Presocratics](https://www.amazon.com/Texts-Early-Greek-Philosophy-Presocratics/dp/0521608422) which unfortunately comes with a scandalous academic-publishing markup. Interlibrary loan is the way to go if you can. It’s not as exhaustive as the full _Die Fragmente Der Vorsokrater_ above but it’s quite broad and comes with modern notes and commentary (a full review [here](https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/the-texts-of-early-greek-philosophy-the-complete-fragments-and-selected-testimonies-of-the-major-presocratics-2/))

_A Presocratics Reader_  by Patricia Curd — from, I think, 1996 — is available online [here ](https://www.hrstud.unizg.hr/_download/repository/Curd,_A_Presocratics_Reader.pdf)(I _hope_  that’s a legal version and not just a scan-and-upload of copyrighted material). It’s less exhaustive than the other two — but of course it’s right there and free.
