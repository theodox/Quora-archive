# Where did the term 'sophist' come from - did the people we now think of as the sophists refer to themselves that way?

It was originally a neutral team for a professional educator or teacher.

 By Plato's time. the sophists were quite common but not always in the highest repute: his critiques share the pretty common Athenian view that the sophists undermined morality and "made the weaker argument the stronger" rather than teaching valuable truths. The poorer citizens thought they were slick and "sophisticated", many richer ones worried that they undermined traditional values. As Aristophanes shows, the distinction between what, say, [Gorgias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgias) was doing and what Socrates was doing was not very clear to contemporaries -- you will notice though that Aristophanes mistakenly thinks Socrates was interested in natural philosophy as well: he's not a great witness for what Socrates was actually up to, only for popular notions about him.

The distinction that Plato and Aristotle draw between philosophy and sophism is an effort to separate out what they are doing from a somewhat dubious stereotype: like a politician portraying himself as a non-partisan "public servant", Plato is trying to create a more respectable aura while doing many of the same activities. 

 It's not clear how long it took for the distinction between "philosophers" and "sophists" to become commonplace. By the time of the [Second Sophistic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sophistic) (around the same time as the Roman conquest of Greece in the 2d C BC), the distinction was clearly well known but the negative connotation of sophism had also been mellowed and refined. [Philostratus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philostratus), a self-described sophist and author of [Lives of the Sophists](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eunapius_02_text.htm#PLOTINUS) said that the philosopher investigates truth; the sophist embellishes it, and takes it for granted. In the later empire, sophists where teachers of rhetoric and oratory and a mainstay of upper-class education.
