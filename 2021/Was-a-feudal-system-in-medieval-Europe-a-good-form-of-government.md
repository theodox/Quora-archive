Ah… but _was_  it a system of government at all?

The rulers of post-Roman Europe had a couple of really serious problems to deal with (even if you discount their recurrent, endemic conflicts with each other).

The first problem was the lack of administrators. The post-Roman ruling class was primarily made up of warriors: most of the reason they ended up as rulers in the first place was because of their access to the means of violence. It’s not quite correct to see them all as “barbarians” — during the long transition from Roman rule to medieval kingdoms quite a few upper-class Romans abandoned the life of the civilian bureaucrat for that of the warlord. Urban life and literacy were in steep decline — so it was hard for any post-Roman state to find lawyers, tax-collectors, and book-keepers to keep managed a government in the old Roman style. Almost all of the successor states tried to maintain a version of the old Roman system, but it was difficult without a large class of educated, literate, and socially connected people to manage the details. Within three or four generations the new kingdoms had to outsource all of their most complex diplomatic, legal, and administrative work the the Church, which was the only reservoir of literate people available.

The difficulty of keeping a functioning state together was compounded by a second problem: poverty. The old Roman system had been integrated to a degree that would not reappear in the west for many centuries: good transportation, low tariffs on trade, and the easy availability of money (both cash and credit) made it many aspects of government easier: if an emperor wanted an aqueduct built in Gaul, he had access to the tax revenue and the labor of a hundred million people to draw on. He could borrow money to cover the immediate cash costs, and he could bring in labor and technical specialists from a wide area. For a post-Roman king, things were much tougher: there were fewer people to tax, the machinery available to actually handle the taxation was falling apart, and Europe was desperately short of actual _money_ , ie, of precious metals. That limited supply of gold and silver was particularly important if you wanted access to any of the luxuries of the rest of the world, since in the post-Roman world long distance travel was too fragmentary to support bulk commodity trades: if the king of Burgundy wanted some nice Byzantine silk or glass from Egypt he’d have to buy it with silver: none of the traders he dealt with would have the ability or the desire to haul away tons of agricultural produce.

Together the shaky administrative structure and the cash-poor economy were a very hard problem for your average post-Roman ruler. It’s tough to prosper as a warlord if you can’t pay your armies! Sure, there’s prestige and maybe some degree of inherited family glamor but in the end you need to be able to put a roof over the head of your army if you plan on a future in the warlording industry.



Enter: __feudalism__ . Not as a system of _government_ : rather, as system of _payments_ : a __medieval crypto-currency__ .

A fief is, essentially, a _privatized form of taxation._ Instead of paying you a salary in cash, I as the king will grant you, my retainer, the equivalent value in the form of my tax revenues.

> Fritigern, you can have all the taxes I am owed in Avaricum: that should cover you and a couple of hundred of your men; you work out the details with the local bishop.

In theory that’s all feudalism is: swapping tax liens for cash.

On paper (er, vellum) the king is still responsible for the law of the land and defense of the realm. The classic feudal titles are really just late-Roman army ranks: a duke is a _[dux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dux)_ , something like a major-general or a marshal. A count is a _[comes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comes#Imperial_Roman_curial_titles_and_offices_styled_Comites)_ , literally a “companion” of the duke but in practice a general officer capable of field command. [Baron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron\) originally meant “soldier,” and the “chivalry” of a knight comes from the same root as _cavalry._ 

In theory these were simply offices, bestowed by the king and the associated tax revenue was simply the salary which came with those offices. For a cash-strapped post-Roman king trying to keep his army fed, clothed and housed without a lot of cash and a sophisticated bureaucracy, “feudalism” was a lifeline: a cheap, low-maintenance way to keep the government functioning.



There is, however, one important catch.

In a fairly poor, agrarian society there aren’t a lot of great candidates competing for the next generation of offices. There’s no officer training school or bootcamp: you have to learn how to be a _dux_  or a _comes_ or even a _baron_ on your own. Most other professions were already more or less hereditary — a legacy of the late-Roman command economy — so it made sense that soldiering would be hereditary too. After all, as an heir you had the chance to learn on the job, and you had social connections and on-the-ground knowledge of the region on which your family’s influence was based.

Unfortunately for his highness the king, however, you were also very _present_ , while he was most likely an almost mythical figure whom nobody in your neighborhood had ever seen. Thus, it didn’t take too long for those “government-offices-with-salaries-in-kind” to morph into _inheritable personal possessions._ 

Duke succeeded Duke and Count succeeded Count and the family in the local manor started to look like the “natural” rulers of a given area. The fortifications which had been thrown up hastily to slow down the Vikings or the Magyars or the Saracens turned out to be just as good at discouraging the king himself from being too assertive about his rights. There were limits — in most of Europe, “high justice” (serious offences meriting the death penalty) remained in the hands of the king and his appointed judges. However a lot of everyday law (family law, property disputes, and misdemeamors) were handled by someone closer to hand. This put a lot of power in the hands of the local hierarchy. Add a couple of centuries of repetition and voila, it’s _[Ivanhoe](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ivanhoe-novel-by-Scott)_ with scheming barons and so on (though here again: you’ll notice it’s still Bad King John who’s behind the exorbitant taxes, and his appointed Sherriff of Nottingham).

If you look at this from the standpoint of modern political science, it’s more like the slow-motion implosion of government than a “system”: it’s a long low point in the sophistication and reach of governmental institutions across most of Europe. On the other hand, if you look at it as an evolutionary adaptation to the realities of a cash-strapped, de-urbanized, and very dangerous world it’s actually quite successful. If nothing else, the feudal military complex managed to harness enough of Europe’s very limited resources to stave off quite a few aggressive neighbors: the Vikings, Saracens, Magyars, and Slavs would all have to admit that those somewhat dubious feudal monarchies managed to hold on under very trying circumstances.

You might also add on the plus side of the ledger — remember Ivanhoe again ! — that it was feudal pluralism of power which laid the stage for modern constitutional government: it was King John’s barons who forced him to sign the [Magna Carta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta). The modern concept of rights is, ultimately, descended from the medieval idea that the king had bargain with his nobles, rather than simply ordering them around. It took a few centuries to generalize “rights” from the rights of the barons to the rights of the populace at large… but you have to start _somewhere._

_King John promises to respect the rights of his barons — having just lost a war to them. Not governance at its finest, but still a notable step on the road to democracy._
