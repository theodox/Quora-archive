Yes, but it’s hard for us to gauge their real level of awareness.

Greeks were very much aware of the existence of a Persian wise man named Zoroaster (Ζωροάστρης in Greek , _Zaraθuštra_ in Avestan) and they referenced variants of Ahura Mazda by name (usually as Oromasdes, Ὠρομάσδης) . However their familiarity was rather limited: t was more common to foist Greek concerns onto a vaguely defined, exotic eastern wisdom than to discuss any actual details of belief or practice.*

__Ritual__ 

__Zoroaster__ was widely known as the founder of Persian religion, but beyond that acknowledgement confusion reigned. Some writers place him in remote antiquity: Plutarch, for example, [puts Zoroaster five thousand years before the Trojan war](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0239%3Asection%3D46) (so, roughly our 6200 BCE) . Other sources placed him in the time of Hystaspes (Persian _Vištāspa_ ), identified as the father of the undeniably historical [Darius I ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_the_Great)which would bring him forward to the middle of our 6th century BCE and make him a contemporary of [Cyrus the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great). Modern estimates, by the way, range from the 7th to about the 16th century BCE, without a strong consensus; in this sense we’re not much better informed than the Greeks.

In __Herodotus__ there are some details of contemporary Persian practice, but it’s not clear even to specialists how well they correspond to todays’ Zoroastrianism. He [notes the aniconic Persian rites ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D131):

> It is not their custom to make and set up statues and temples and altars, but those who do such things they think foolish, because, I suppose, they have never believed the gods to be like men, as the Greeks do

On the other hand his account of who exactly they were worshipping isn’t always an easy fit for later Zoroastrian beliefs::

> they call the whole circuit of heaven Zeus, and to him they sacrifice on the highest peaks of the mountains; they sacrifice also to the sun and moon and earth and fire and water and winds. From the beginning, these are the only gods to whom they have ever sacrificed; they learned later to sacrifice to the “heavenly” Aphrodite from the Assyrians and Arabians. She is called by the Assyrians Mylitta, by the Arabians Alilat, by the Persians Mitra.

Mithra — better known in western sources as [Mithras](https://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/mithras/display.php?page=main) — is an important figure in later Zoroastrianism but despite what Herodotus wrote he’s male and typically associated with the sun.**** Some of the ritual details he provides are recognizable (the role of fire, the use of [excarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Silence#:~:text=A%20dakhma%2C%20also%20known%20as,the%20soil%20with%20the%20corpses.)) others not so much.

__Theology__ 

The most striking omission in Herodotus’ version is any mention of [theological dualism](https://iranicaonline.org/articles/dualism) — the cosmic struggle against the “destructive spirit”, [Ahriman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahriman) and the [daevas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daeva#:~:text=A%20daeva%20(Avestan%3A%20%F0%90%AC%9B%F0%90%AC%80%F0%90%AC%89%F0%90%AC%8E%F0%90%AC%8E%F0%90%AC%80%20da%C4%93uua,(to%20be)%20rejected%22.) who personify chaos and evil. This was, of course, quite alien to the classical Greek view but it didn’t go unnoticed forever: it ended up having a strong influence on Persian-era Judaism, on early Christianity, and was also manifested in the popularity of [Manichaeism ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism)in the Roman era. __Plutarch__ , for example picked it up in his book on [Isis and Osiris:](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0239%3Asection%3D47)

> The great majority and the wisest of men hold this opinion: they believe that there are two gods, rivals as it were, the one the Artificer of good and the other of evil. There are also those who call the better one a god and the other a daemon, as, for example, Zoroaster the sage […] He called the one Oromazes [=Ahura Mazda] and the other Areimanius [= Ahriman]; and he further declared that among all the things perceptible to the senses, Oromazes may best be compared to light, and Areimanius, conversely, to darkness and ignorance, and midway between the two is Mithras ; for this reason the Persians give to Mithras the name, of ‘Mediator.’

This summary would not likely satisfy a modern Parsee theologian, but it clearly catches a notable aspect of the Persian approach earlier Greeks failed to call out. What’s interesting to note is that for Plutarch (writing in the second century of our era) “The great majority and the wisest of men hold this opinion” — a tribute to the spread of Persian-influenced dualist ideas in the six centuries since Herodotus.

Eventually the Greek and Roman world would encounter the evolution of Persian religious thought as well. The Sassanid-era version of Zoroastrianism has some features which are markedly different from the modern faith. Our understanding of the differences is complicated in interesting ways by the fact that most of the significant differences are only reported in non-Persian sources (Greek, Syriac, Armenian and Arabic).. The whole history of Sassanid-flavored Zoroastrianism, sometimes known as [Zurvanism](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/zurvanism) — is poorly attested in actual Zoroastrian sources: it was to some degrees a dead end in Zoroastrian religious history. Thus, it’s visible mostly in outside texts which describe Sassanian beliefs. It’s a complex and ambiguous piece of history that’s not well understood at all but it again does show that Roman-era Greek (and Syriac and Armenian) writers engaged with Zoroastrian ideas in some detail.

__Practical matters__ 

However, the most common approach was less perceptive and more naïve.

For the most part Hellenistic Greeks and Romans were less interested in Persian theology and more interested in the supposed powers of the ___[magoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magi)___ , the Persian “wise men” who appear in the Bible and in Greek and Roman texts as symbols of esoteric knowledge. This reputation for spiritual powers was so widespread that _magos_ replaced the older Greek word _goes_ (γόης ) as the standard word for “sorcerer” — our word “magic” comes directly from that reputation. Zoroaster, as the nominal inventor of both the religion of the magoi and of astrology, became the best-selling “brand” in later Greek and Roman esoteric circles. [As Pliny said](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D30%3Achapter%3D2), “There is no doubt that [magic] originated in Persia, under Zoroaster, this being a point upon which authors are generally agreed.” *****

With that reputation spreading widely in the Roman era, [it became fairly common to attribute philosophical, mystical, and astrological texts to Zoroaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroaster#In_classical_antiquity) . This was so popular that a Greek scholar in Alexandria was credited with [providing an index for the “two million verses” of Zoroaster’s poetry.](https://iranicaonline.org/articles/hermippus-of-smyrna)

The Persian prophet’s authority was sometimes attached to Greek sages or philosophers — even quite early Aristoxenus (writing around the time of Alexander) had the Greek Pythagoras studying with “Zaratas the Chaldeaean,” clearly a misnomer for Zoroaster. Democritus, Plato, and Empedocles were among the other philosophers said to have traveled east to learn from the magoi. The actual contents of works attributed to Zoroaster or other Persian wizards generally seem like a mishmash of Babylonian astrology, Egyptian hermeticism, and Greek ideas rather than a reflection of contemporary Persian ideas — though, given the complex cultural cross-currents in the Mediterranean/Mesopotamian world it’s not really easy to tell. Plutarch (a priest of Apollo!) evoked an eminently Zoroastrian set of ideas — but then went on to foist them onto Osiris and Isis. It’s a perfect example of the complex cross-currents of thought in the early Roman era.

The most famous and visible impact of Persian cultural stylings in the west was [Mithraism ](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/mithraic-mysteries)— definitely not an orthodox version of Zoroastrianism, essentially an entirely different faith but one which claimed Zoroaster’s authority and borrowed many Persian trappings.

__TLDR__ 

Greeks and Romans were acquainted with contemporary Persian thought, but with highly variable degrees of insight and sophistication. The cultural boundaries were clearly quite porous, but the exchange of ideas didn’t reach a level of precision or detail that we could wish for. It’s also very difficult for us to know exactly how to evaluate the Greek and Roman evidence because we have so few other sources for contemporary Persian practice and belief: Darius’s inscriptions definitely _sound_ very Zoroastrian — certainly, he was a devotee of Ahura Mazda and eager to denounce the _daevas —_ but we don’t really know how he or his contemporaries thought or behaved apart from what we read in Herodotus. That makes it hard to know if Herodotus or another Greek author was was misreporting, or if things were simply different in the Persian religious world they knew. The first-hand Persian sources really only pick up under the Sassanids, generally from the fourth century on.

The first great survey of Persian thought in Greek sources is Bidez and Cumont, _[Les Mages Hellénisés](https://www.amazon.com/Mages-Hell%C3%A9nis%C3%A9s-Zoroastre-tradition-Anciennes/dp/2251443312https://amzn.to/3BEFDiU)_  in French. The key thesis about how the texts were spread is not very popular any more but it’s a broad survey of the sources. The last chapter of Arnoldo Momigliano’s _[Alien Wisdom](https://www.amazon.com/Mages-Hell%C3%A9nis%C3%A9s-Zoroastre-tradition-Anciennes/dp/2251443312)_  is a good, digestible survey in English (and the book is just great, generally!)



*A good comparison is the equally cavalier Greek treatment of Judaism, another belief system which the Greeks were able to name-check but about which they seem never to have been well informed despite centuries of close contact. 
** In the Avesta, Zoroaster is patronized by a wise man named _Vištāspa_ . But the Gathas seem to date on linguistic evidence to the previous millennium . On the other hand, the Zoroastrian _Bundahishn_  puts Zoroaster 258 years before Alexander — maybe a Greek guess based on the name, that got adopted by a later Persian writer? Everything to do with Zoroaster’s date is dicey.
*** It’s typical of the confusion that a few apocalyptic prophecies attributed to Hystaspes circulated in the Roman Empire. It’s worth noting that, in a very typical Roman reaction, the being caught with a copy of the _Prophecies of Hystaspes,_ which predicted the downfall of the Roman empire and the rise of global savior “from the east” was a death-penalty offense.

**** A not entirely implausible explanation for Herodotus’ mistake, however, here:



***** Magic was both extremely popular and also extremely dubious in Greek and Roman eyes. Pliny’s discussion calls it “that monstrous art” and depicts the Greek interest (naturally, good Romans were supposed to be above such things) as “madness”.
