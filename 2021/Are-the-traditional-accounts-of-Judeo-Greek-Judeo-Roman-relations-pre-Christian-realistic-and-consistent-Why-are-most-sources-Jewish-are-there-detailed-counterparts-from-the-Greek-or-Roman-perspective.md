They are interestingly asymmetrical, which is hardly surprising given the imperial power dynamics involved.

For the Greeks and Romans, Jews were just one of hundreds of “obscure”, “minor” ethnic groups with odd customs who had to be incorporated into the various empires under which they lived. For the Jews, on the other hand, the realities of Hellenizing and later Roman life were inescapable realities. It’s a relationship that should be anybody familiar with the perspective of post-colonial societies today.

Here’s a brief rundown of the sources — the scantiness should give you an idea of how comparatively obscure the Jews were from the Greco-Roman perspective. There’s generally more non-literary material after the first century but given the fragmentary nature of the sources this answer will give them short shrift — most of them are collected in the _Corpus papyrorum Judaicarum_ edited by Viktor Tcherikover, Alexander Fuks, and Menahem Stern ([available for timed free loan from archive.org](https://archive.org/details/corpuspapyrorumj0001tche))

__Early years (before the 2d century BCE)__ 

__Herodotus__  [mentions in passing](https://www.quora.com/What-did-the-Greek-historian-Herodotus-refer-to-the-Jews-as/answer/Steve-Theodore) that “the Syrians of Palestine” practice circumcision and claims they learned the custom from Egypt. It’s not clear that he’s referring to Jews or only to Jews.

__[Hecataeus of Abdera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecataeus_of_Abdera)__ (circa 350 BCE) wrote a history of Egypt, which included an account of the Hebrews. Given the timing and the tradition which associates Hecataeus with Ptolemy I, it’s likely that he had Jewish or Jewish-Egyptian informants. A long extract or paraphrase from this is included in the works of __Diodorus Siculus__  ([book 40, 3ff](http://attalus.org/translate/diodorus40.html)) includes the story that is recognizably related to — but quite different from — the traditional version of the exodus:

> Since we are about to give an account of the war against the Jews, we consider it appropriate, before we proceed further, in the first place to relate the origin of this nation, and their customs. In ancient times a great plague occurred in Egypt, and many ascribed the cause of it to the gods, who were offended with them. For since the multitudes of strangers of different nationalities, who lived there, made use of their foreign rites in religious ceremonies and sacrifices, the ancient manner of worshipping the gods, practised by the ancestors of the Egyptians, had been quite lost and forgotten. 2 Therefore the native inhabitants concluded that, unless all the foreigners were driven out, they would never be free from their miseries. All the foreigners were forthwith expelled, and the most valiant and noble among them, under some notable leaders, were brought to Greece and other places, as some relate; the most famous of their leaders were Danaus and Cadmus. But the majority of the people descended into a country not far from Egypt, which is now called Judaea and at that time was altogether uninhabited.

> The leader of this colony was one Moses, a very wise and valiant man, who, after he had possessed himself of the country, amongst other cities, built that now most famous city, Jerusalem, and the temple there, which is so greatly revered among them. He instituted the holy rites and ceremonies with which they worship God; and made laws for the methodical government of the state

DIodorus’ summary (which again, he attributes to Hecataeus) is fairly positive, with Moses portrayed as wise legislator in the mold of Solon or Lycurgus. Diodorus also touches (in a less complementary way) Pompey’s dealings with the Hasmonean dynasty in book 40.

Aristotle’s student __[Theophrastus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastus)__ __,__ writing around the same time, discussed Jewish sacrificial customs (cited in Josephus, [Against Apion 1.167](https://lexundria.com/j_ap/1.167/wst) and Porphyry, [On Abstinence from Animal Food, 2.26](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_abstinence_02_book2.htm)) . He apparently regarded Jews, or at least Jewish priests, as “belonging to the class of philosophers”. The details provided don’t line up perfectly with the biblical instructions for sacrifice — it’s not obvious if this is an accurate account of a tradition no recorded or a garbled secondhand account.

About a generation later __[Megasthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megasthenes)__ — a Seleucid ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya is quoted (albeit much later — by Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria) as putting Jews in the same intellectual category as the Brahmins of India and the philosophers of Greece. (Megasthenes [Fragment XLII](https://archive.org/stream/ancientindiaasd01mccrgoog/ancientindiaasd01mccrgoog_djvu.txt)). Megasthenes however has a fairly mixed reputation for accuracy — it’s not clear how much of this stems from his own writing and how much comes from later additions foisted on his name. It is worth noting, however, that the term Megasthenes used for Buddhists (θερᾰπευται, therapeutai, “helpers” or “healers”) is the same one the Jewish writer Josephus would later use to describe the Essenes and other rigorist Jews).

The more or less favorable view from the early Hellenistic period is also visible in the later 2d century BCE writings of __[Hermippus of Smyrna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermippus_of_Smyrna)__  claimed, in a biography of Pythagoras (which survives only in quotations) that the philosopher had borrowed doctrines from Judaism. This is an interesting twist on the common Greek assertion that this or that famous philosopher travelled to Egypt (or occasionally, to Babylon or India) in search of important ideas.

A last vestige of the positive view of Moses the lawgiver is visible in the geography of __Strabo__ in the early years of our era ([book 16, 34ff](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16B*.html)).

The Ptolemies conquered Palestine around 300 BCE — the resulted in the arrival of large numbers of Jews in Egypt, first as slaves but shortly as immigrants as well. There had been a notable Jewish community in Egypt under the Persians but the early Ptolemaic years saw a notable uptick: Jews would eventually be one of the largest minority group in Egypt, perhaps an eighth of the population. The [traditional Jewish account of the translation of the Hebrew scriptures into Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Aristeas) — that Ptolemy II commissioned a translation for the Library of Alexandria — is often regarded as embellished but it was widely circulated at least as early as the mid-2d century BCE. This period marked a significant uptick in Jewish-Greek contacts, particularly in Alexandria.

__From Antiochus IV to Tiberius__ 

Unfortunately that closer association was not always a happy one. Hecataeus — despite his generally positive relation of the origins of Judaism, he characterized Jewish exceptionalism like this:

> as a result of their own expulsion from Egypt, he (Moses) introduced a kind of reclusive (apanthrôpos) and inhospitable (misoxenos) way of life.

Over time the charge of “misanthropy” — of dislike of everybody else — became central to Greek and later Roman opinion of Jews. The turn for the worse seems to emerge in the second century BCE as a side-effect of the war in Seleucid Judea between __[Antiochus IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes)__  (r 175–164) and the [Maccabees](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-maccabees-heroes-or-fanatics/) — a war known only from the Jewish sources: Greek histories of the period are far more concerned with the clashes between the Seleucids and Rome.

This conflict spawned a number of hostile tropes which circulated widely in the Greek world, most infamously the assertion that Jews practiced ritual murder of outsiders (Josephus, [Against Apion, II.8](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/apion-2.html)) and the peculiar claim that the in temple of Jerusalem the Jews worshiped the head of a donkey ([Against Apion, II.7](http:// Against Apion, II.8 (https://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/apion-2.html))) . Both of these slanders circulated widely in the Roman world for the next several centuries — __Fronto__ , Marcus Aurelius’ beloved tutor, and __Tacitus__ both repeat the bit about the donkey’s head though transposed onto Christians. Accusations of ritual murder became a common justification for the persecutions of Christians as well. We even have a letter from much later, during the Kitos War of 115–117, from a Greco-Egyptian mother praying that her son not be “cooked” by the Jews against whom he was fighting.

_[An anti-Christian graffito from Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexamenos_graffito)_ _, around 200, recycling the anti-semitic trope about the donkey’s head which first emerged three and a half centuries earlier. Photo: Wikipedia._ 

Alexandria — the center of Greek literary culture in the Hellenistic and Roman eras — was known for particularly virulent antisemitism. The foremost examples are two Hellenized Egyptians: __[Manetho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho)__ ____ and __[Apion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apion)__ __.__ Most of what we know about these two writer’s attitudes towards Jews comes from Jewish writers attempting to refute their charges, such as the examples cited above by Josephus. Manetho offers an interesting twist on the story of the exodus as recorded by Hecataeus: in his version the exiled Jews are lepers expelled at the command of the Egyptian gods and — in another twist — they conquered and terrorized the Egyptians as well as barbarously eating sacred animals ritually protected by Egyptian custom. (Summary and sources [here](https://vridar.org/2015/05/26/moses-and-exodus-according-to-the-egyptian-priest-manetho/), both as quoted by Josephus). __[Chaeremon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaeremon_of_Alexandria)__ and __[Lysimachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysimachus_of_Alexandria)__ (both “of Alexandria”) were other notable Greco-Egyptian anti-Semitic writers also quoted by their opponents, particularly by Josephus and [Philo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo) .

In addition to the ancient version of trolling, however, the Alexandrian anti-Semitic tradition had a deadly dimension: Apion attempted to incite Caligula against the Jews of Alexandria — effort which failed, but which set the stage for [violent confrontations in 38 and 40 CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandrian_riots_(38)), a presage for the violence which killed (according to Jospehus) 50,000 in 66 and finally the annihilation of the Egyptian Jewish community in the [Kitos War of 115–117](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War). Some of the less famous examples of Alexandrian attitudes towards Jews are collected in the so-called “__[Acts of the Pagan Martyrs](https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/alexandrian-martyrs-acts)__ ” — a collection of Alexandrian texts recording various conflicts between Alexandrian Greeks and Roman authority, usually over the desire of the Greeks to do something about (or to) their Jewish neighbors (not online, as far as I can find). Many modern scholars think these documents paint a misleadingly rosy picture of Jewish-Roman relations: the fundamental agenda was anti-Roman and the alleged fondness of the Caesars for the Jews is intended to make the Caesars look bad, not to make the Jews look good.

You can see vestiges of both the older, more positive treatment of Judaism and the post-Seleucid climate of hostility in Strabo ([16.37](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16B*.html)):

> [Moses’] successors for some time abided by the same course, acting righteously and being truly pious towards God; but afterwards, in the first place, superstitious men were appointed to the priesthood, and then tyrannical people; and from superstition arose abstinence from flesh, from which it is their custom to abstain even to‑day, and circumcisions and excisions​ and other observances of the kind. And from the tyrannies arose the bands of robbers;​ for some revolted and harassed the country, both their own country and that of their neighbours, whereas others, co-operating with the rulers, seized the property of others and subdued much of Syria and Phoenicia. But still they had respect for their acropolis, since they did not loathe it as the seat of tyranny, but honoured and revered it as a holy place.

He goes on to describe Pompey’s conquest of Judaea. The conquest of Judaea also triggered some controversy at Rome, recorded in __Cicero__ ([Pro Flacco 67.ff](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0019%3Atext%3DFlac.%3Asection%3D67)) — Pompey generally kept his hands off the temple treasury but Cicero’s client Flaccus was accused of confiscating money the Jews of his province were trying send to Jerusalem. Cicero defends his client saying

> to resist this barbarous superstition were an act of dignity, to despise the multitude of Jews, which at times was most unruly in the assemblies in defence of the interests of the republic, was an act of the greatest wisdom.

A quote which suggests — beyond its casual hostility — that some kind of organized pro-Jewish voice could be heard in the Roman assemblies in the last decade of the Republic. The context of the speech implies that Cicero’s opponents in the case, whose arguments have not survived, appealed to Roman respect for Jewish tradition as part of their case: a good reason to remember that ancient opinions were no more homogenous than our own.

__Wars of the first century and their aftermath__ 

Whatever the Alexandrians might have thought, Roman-Jewish relations deteriorated rapidly after the reign of Claudius.

The [Judean revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_wars#First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War), which culminated with the destruction of the Jewish temple and the sack of Jerusalem in the year 70, is described in Tacitus (Histories, parts of books 2, 4, and 5). Tacitus’s ethnography in [Histories 5, 1–10](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Histories/5A*.html) is generally hostile and repeats several familiar Greek tropes, such as the business about the donkey’s head — despite some paragraphs later noting Jewish aversion to images. He mentions in passing that some contemporaries identified the Jewish god with Dionysus, and idea also found (in a less hostile frame) in __Plutarch’s__ [Convivial Questions (4.6)](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0312%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D6%3Asection%3D2). Tacitus offers a kind of survey view of the anti-Semitic tradition, re-emphazing ideas of Jewish misanthropy and dubious origins, adding for good measure the accusation that Jews won’t sleep with gentiles but that there’s “nothing they won’t do” with one another.

Another account of the war appears in __[Cassius Dio, book 65](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/65*.html)__ , but without the negative commentary.

Dio also chronicles ([68.32](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html)) the Kitos War of 115–117, which broke out while Trajan was campaigning against the Parthians in Mesopotamia. The Parthians generally had pretty good relations with the large Jewish communities in their territories, and it’s likely that war stemmed in part from Roman Jews supporting their cousins in return for the foreign volunteers who had fought in the revolt fifty years before. Here the Greek rather than the Jewish sources predominate: Dio’s account focuses on the brutality of the Jewish guerillas in Cyrenaica, Egypt and Cyprus. He also records Hadrian’s destruction of Jerusalem ([69.12–14](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/69*.html)) in the Bar Kochba war. There are numerous Jewish accounts of this last conflict — mostly traditional, but there are [a few contemporary letters from the rebel leader](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/oriental-varia/four-letters-of-bar-kochba/), though they are not particularly revealing. Unsurprisingly both sides are eloquent about the atrocities attributed to their enemies in this brutal conflict.

__Jews in Rome,__ 

It’s possible that Tacitus’ hostility also reflects the visible presence of Jews in Rome itself in the first century.

Several Roman writers in the first century noted — generally with disapproval — the spread of Jewish customs and observances in Rome, brought by immigrants and slaves. For example __Horace__ ([Satires 1.4](https://latinintranslation.wordpress.com/2011/09/10/horace-satires-1-4/)) tries to induce a friend to join his literary circle like this:

> A great band of poets shall come which should be to my
Aid, for we are many by the more, and we shall compel
You , just as the Jews did, to concede to this crowd.

He also makes fun of a Roman friend who doesn’t want to go roistering on the Sabbath for fear of offending his Jewish aquaintances. __Ovid__ encourages his love-lorn readers not to give up chasing after women “where the foul drove on Sabbaths rest from everything but love,” repeating the stereotype of Jewish promiscuity (_[Ars Amatoria, I](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0069%3Atext%3DArs)_ ). Most famously __Juvenal__ ([14.96](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/juvenal_satires_14.htm)) thinks Romans who have adopted the Jewish Sabbath have just done so to get out of work:

> Some who have had a father who reveres the Sabbath, worship nothing but the clouds, and the divinity of the heavens, and see no difference between eating swine's flesh, from which their father abstained, and that of man; and in time they take to circumcision. Having been wont to flout the laws of Rome, they learn and practise and revere the Jewish law, and all that Moses committed to his secret tome, forbidding to point out the way to any not worshipping the same rites, and conducting none but the circumcised to the desired fountain. For all which the father was to blame, who gave up every seventh day to idleness, keeping it apart from all the concerns of life.

You’ll note he repeats the hostile stereotype of Jews unwilling “to point out the way to any not worshipping the same rite.”

Somewhat more seriously, __Seneca__ (as quoted by Augustine, [City of God 6.11](http://amitay.haifa.ac.il/index.php/Augustinus,_De_Civitate_Dei_6.11)) disparages the Sabbath as a subversion of hard-working Roman tradition:

> Yet the customs of this most base people have so prevailed that they are adopted in all the world, and the conquered have given their laws to the conquerors

(he also left a [peculiar swipe at the tradition of lighting lamps ahead of the sabbath](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_95): “let us forbid lamps to be lighted on the Sabbath, since the gods do not need light, neither do men take pleasure in soot”) .

Its interesting that despite the significant visibility of the Jews in Roman life from the first century onward, most of our sources seem not to have bothered to acquire much detailed acquaintance with the people they stigmatized. Tacitus — a contemporary of Juvenal and a later than Seneca — still repeats the business about the donkey’s head; Plutarch, around the same time, is genuinely puzzled by Jewish aversion to pork and to graven images, even though it can’t have been that difficult to simply ask for an explanation. It’s noted that there are most of the rumored Jewish converts in Roman high society were women like [Fulvia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulvia_(wife_of_Saturninus))or [Flavia Domitilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavia_Domitilla_(saint)) — the public stigma of association with Jews was more of a deterrent to the kind of men who wrote our literary sources.

__Years of crisis (70 -136)__ 

The Jewish war which culminated in the destruction of the Second Temple is chronicled by Tacitus (as above), and of course also survives in a variety of physical remains: the copious coinage issued by Vespasian and Titus and most visibly the [Masada Ramp](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-evidence-to-prove-that-Titus-Josephus-an-Jewish-revolts-against-Romans-are-forged-historical-accounts-created-by-later-Christian-Judaistic-and-Islamic-authors-to-create-a-history-for-their-new-found/answer/Steve-Theodore) and the [Colosseum](https://www.quora.com/Where-did-the-money-come-from-to-finance-the-building-of-the-Colosseum/answer/Steve-Theodore), built mainly on the spoils of the campaign. The Arch of Titus is still off limits to orthodox Jews since it visibly celebrates the spoliation of the temple:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3827dad63fd0f3e41f14b0a56637e27a)

_The arch of Titus_ 

However it was the terrible events of the years between [115 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War)and [136 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt)which seem to have hardened Greek and Roman attitudes towards significantly. The Kitos War was a brutal guerilla conflict which left hundreds of thousands of civilians dead on both sides; receipts from the _[fiscus judaicus,](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/fiscus-judaicus/)_ __ the punitive tax levied on Jews after the first Jewish War, effectively disappeared in Egypt after 115: a stark testimony to the near extinction of a large community, at one time something like 10–15% of the whole population. The historian __[Appian of Alexandria](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/appian/)__  narrowly avoided being killed by Jewish raiders as a young man — but, unfortunately for us, he didn’t leave a record of the conflict and concentrated on much earlier Roman wars.

At the peak of the conflict, under Hadrian, the Romans flirted with the complete suppression of Judaism; this period is documented, with great resentment, in Jewish traditions. The key Greek and Roman sources here are Cassius Dio [(69.12 ff),](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/cassius-dio/cassius-dio-on-bar-kochba/) and the somewhat dubious __[Historia Augusta](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/historia_augusta/hadrian/1*.html)__ . This too is unsurprisingly embroidered on in Jewish tradition.

To sum up: there are plenty of Greek and Roman sources detailing interactions with the Jews. They tend to fall into four large clusters:

early sources which regard the Jews primarily as an exotic ethnographic curiosity

Sources from the early Hellenistic period that are somewhat better informed and slightly positive in tone

Sources from the second century to the early Roman imperial period that are increasingly hostile on a social level — in Greek these tend to be very antisemitic, in Latin they are more bemused while still negative.

Imperial era sources that chronicle the very violent conflict between Rome and the Jews.

None of these are “objective” — the Jewish alternatives, of course, aren’t either. However they can be understood as part of comprehensible, if tragic, evolution from the early contacts through two very confrontational periods with an interesting — but largely under-recorded — set of cultural exchanges happening just outside the spotlight of our sources.

It’s worth remembering that the Jews only received serious attention from the dominant Greco-Roman culture during serious clashes: when things were proceeding in a less dramatic fashion, little was being recorded. Throughout this period archaeology shows a large Jewish diaspora in the eastern Mediterranean and Italy (less so in Greece, interestingly). There we see much more evidence of ordinary cultural crossovers, whether it’s the Hellenistic paintings adorning a [synagogue in Dura-Europos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura-Europos_synagogue)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3b0a0cddaee35e3784aafe99d6607690)

or Jewish invocations in Greco-Egyptian magical formulae, there’s a whole realm of interactions that are hard to see in the written sources but were clearly going on.
