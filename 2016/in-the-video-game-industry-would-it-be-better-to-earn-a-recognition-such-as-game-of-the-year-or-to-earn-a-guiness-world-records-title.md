Both sets of honors are pretty "honorary". There are dozens of 'Game of the Year awards' from different media outlets, none of them has the global prestige of the Oscars or Emmys in traditional media. Guinness is just another one of them -- unless of course the World Record is something like "Best Selling Video Game Of All Time" -- in which case, Guinness FTW!
