There are three Roman emperors who were born in Africa, and two (though one of these murdered the other) who were the children of one of the first group. By far the most famous of these is [Septimius Severus](https://www.quora.com/Was-Septimius-Severus-Romes-black-emperor/answer/Steve-Theodore), who ruled from 193 to 211.

All of the African born emperors were from the coastal regions of what is today __Tunisia, Algeria,__ and __Libya__ . To the extent we know their family backgrounds, they all seem to have been part of the general population mix in that area: a mix of the people who we today know as Berbers with a sprinkling of the descendants of Carthaginians, who many centuries earlier had come to the region from the Middle East.



Almost all the time when you hear “African” in a Roman context the reference is not to the modern continent of Africa but to the Roman province of Africa — which consisted of the coastal parts of Tunisia and western Libya.
