There were actually three competing sets of coinage (four, if you count the huge number of older issues that were still in use) at different points in the 6th century. This wasn’t much of a problem, since ancient coins were almost always valued for their metal content and not their face value. But the coinage actually throws an interesting light on the strange state of sixth century Italy.

Italy was half-Roman borderland, no longer the heart of the empire. It was ruled by the [Ostrogothic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogothic_Kingdom), which emerged after the imperial succession ended in the west in 476. However, the Roman cast of Italian life remained strong. In theory, the Ostrogoths were imperial subjects, allowed to operate their own ‘kingdoms’ in return for military service to the emperor. In practice, however, the Ostrogoths were an independent power ruling over a Roman citizenry — sometimes amicably, and sometimes not.

The ambiguous relationship is reflected in the coinage. Ostrogothic coins were clearly modeled on Roman ones. This is a [solidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_(coin)) of Ostrogothic king [Theoderic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoderic_the_Great) I, aka. “the Great”.

The inscription reads D N ANASTASIVS P F AVG, “Our lord Anastasius, Dutiful and blessed emperor” on the front and “VICTORIA AUGGG” , “Victory of the emperors” on the back. Theoderic ended up in Italy at the invitation of emperor [Zeno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_(emperor)), Anastasius’ predecessor who decided that Theoderic in Italy could help defeat a different Germanic king, [Odoacer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer) — and that Theoderic was less of a threat in Italy than he had been in the Balkans.

That solidus was the reference unit for sixth century money, like the dollar today. However it was worth much more: it was about 3.25 grams of gold (roughly $125 at today’s gold prices ). Most ordinary people rarely saw one: a single solidus would pay a soldier’s salary for six months or so, or buy a couple of pigs, or maybe 8 bushels of wheat.* There were also smaller gold coins, _[tremisses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremissis)_ __ or ‘thirds’ which were 1/3 of a solidus — perhaps not everyday coinage for ordinary folk, but more likely to be seen in the market.

Most day-to-day coins were variants on the _[nummus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nummus)_ a tiny bronze coin which was supposed to be 1/7200th of a solidus — a trifle over 1/100th of a cent today. A loaf of bread probably cost around 20 or 30 nummi; a liter of wine maybe 15.

Because a single nummus was as impractically small as a solidus was impractically large, a number of denominations were introduced in the early sixth century to make things easier. Here’s a 5-nummi coin (note the large roman numeral on the reverse) from Theodoric’s son Althalaric.

A very common denomination was the _[follis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follis)_ _,_ worth 40 _nummi._ The follis was done in bronze and was about half an inch or 13 mm in diameter. This example is from the Gothic king [Theodahad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodahad). It reflects his efforts to reach a rapprochement with the Roman upper classes — the S C on the reverse is the ancient Republican (!) motto _senatus consulta_ , “with the advice of the Senate.”

It’s worth mentioning in this context that old coins remained in circulation — sometimes for a very long time. Here’s a perfect example, a “double follis” (=80 nummi) which is actually a coin of Trajan issued four centuries before an Ostrogothic moneychanger scratched “LXXXIII” (for 83) into it in the sixth century. Notice the SC on this one too.

Silver coinage was less common in the sixth century after the loss of Spain and Gaul. Old silver continued to circulate freely, and the Ostrogoths did mint some of their own. Silver coins usually came in two sizes, about 1.4 and .7 grams. These are usually called half- and quarter-[siliquae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siliqua) in modern books, though the actual ancient name is not known. Their value probably fluctuated relative to the solidus but the usual ratio in Roman times was between 12:1 and 14:1 silver: gold. A half-siliqua probably represented something like a week’s wages for ordinary people.



Despite the changes of politics there was a lot of continuity as far as coinage went. However, the East-Roman emperor [Justinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I) was determined to re-unite the empire. In 535 he invaded Italy, launching off a [generation of warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_War_(535%E2%80%93554)) which proved to be more devastating to Italy than the previous 50 years of ‘barbarian’ rule.

_A 20-nummus coin of Justinian. The “K” on the reverse is the Greek numeral for “20” (instead of “XX”) showing the gradual Greekification the East Roman state._ 

As a side effect, the local minting of coins slowed down during the long war years — most of the coinage entering circulation came from the mints of the east or from the Roman bastions in Ravenna and Rome.

The bitter reconquest, in any case, did not last long.

After 568 the invasion of the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombards) undid almost all of Justinian’s gains. Italy — devastated by war, depopulated by plague, and thinly defended as the Byzantines wrestled with the Persians — was quickly divided into a series of feuding mini-states, nominally ruled from Pavia but rarely acting as one nation. Only Rome and Ravena remained in Byzantine hands, while the rest of the peninsula was divided up by the Lombards.

Unlike the Ostrogoths the Lombards made no pretense of submission to Constantinople — but even so they still retained Roman style coinage. This Lombard coin is a silver quarter-siliqua of 0.7 grams, very much in the old style and including the head of the Eastern emperor, Justin II.

However if you look carefully you can see that this coin is misspelled: it says IUSTNUS PP AIIO (wrapping around beneath) where it should read IUSTINUS PP AUG (“Justin, Father of the country, Augustus”).

This Lombard tremmissis is a little later — it’s an imitation of a coin of Heraclius, so maybe around 620 — but it shows how quickly the Italian coinage had degenerated into crude copies.

When you compare it to the Byzantine original you can see that the Lombard die -cutter may not have been literate:

Under the Lombards trade contracted and smaller denominations became less common as barter replaced cash in the poorer, more rural Italy they ruled. They still imitated Roman and Byzantine types until the arrival of the Franks introduced Frankish-style denominations.



_* Price data is very spotty for this period. It’s compounded by the fact that Italy was a battleground for half of the sixth century, and was cut off from its traditional sources of cheap grain. These numbers are probably on the optimistic side._
