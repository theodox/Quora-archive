A _[proconsul](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Proconsul.html)_ operated, more or less, as a kind of free-roving consul. In the republic the consuls were, above all, war leaders. Eventually the frequency and scope of Roman military operations made it impossible for the armies in the field to depend on regularly elected consuls, who were very strictly limited to single year terms. So, a former consul who had experience of command would be dispatched to manage a distant army on behalf of the current sitting consul, who might be home at Rome on domestic business or fighting elsewhere.

As a quasi-consul, a proconsul had a lot of broad powers since the consuls were the highest executive officer. In the last century or so of the republic, Rome began to use proconsuls as governors in various provinces. This was a natural extension of the earlier military proconsulate.

A [legatus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Legatus.html), on the other hand, was a generic term for anybody who held delegated authority on behalf of a regularly constituted Roman magistrate; it equates, more or less, to a generic term like “representative.” It could cover a subordinate military commander, an ambassador, or somebody sent to conduct an official investigation. A common use of _legatus_  is for what you might call “staff officers” — privileged assistants of a legally empowered field officer. Many young Roman aristocrats did their military service as volunteer _legati._ 

In the imperial period, when the empire was divided between civilian “Senatorial” provinces and militarized “imperial” ones, _proconsul_ was redefined to become a purely civilian governor of a pacified Senatorial province — the kind of places where trouble was not expected (and where the emperor didn’t worry about a potential rival monopolizing a strategic location). The governors of military provinces, on the other hand, were _legati propraetores._ The use of “_legatus”_ in this context emphasized the fact that they were ultimately acting as personal representatives of the emperor (not as independent officers of the Roman state) and the _propraetor_  emphasized that their office was military rather than civilian in nature but still included judicial functions.
