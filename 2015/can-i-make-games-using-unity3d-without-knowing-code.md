As the other answers correctly point out: no. 

All Unity games require some programming. The only difference is the means of creating the program: visual scripting systems like Playmaker will let you create games without 'code' -- but not without logic, variables, loops and control flow, In other words, its programming for people who don't like to type. 

While that works for some people, the usual arc of systems like that is that they are easy to start with but top out pretty quickly: for most big projects, code scales up better than graphical alternatives. Plus when things go wrong -- particularly when you get a weird bug or one of your systems needs to be redone because it doesn't perform -- code is easier to change, fix and expand.

_No 'code' - but it's sill pretty complex :)_ 

 So, flow-graphs like Playmaker are great if you need to get over the fear of typing, or if you're just experimenting . If swapping in lines and boxes for typing gets you going, it's more than worth it. However the likelihood of outgrowing it is pretty high if your project really makes progress.
