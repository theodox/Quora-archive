Yes — sourced primarily in the vicinity of Armenia and northern Iran, although given the fact that they imported Rhinos from as far away as Sumatra, Indian tigers were not unheard of. Augustus was famously displayed a tame tiger ; Claudius exhibited a set of four (presumably untamed). Much later [Elagalabus had a chariot pulled by tigers](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/historia_augusta/elagabalus/2*.html) as a break from his usual lions.

Pliny’s _Natural History_ , Book 8.25, includes a somewhat dubious story about tiger hunting which might be set in [Hyrcania ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrcania)(by the Caspian Sea) or India.

> The tiger, which lives in Hyrcania and India, can run with terrific speed. To take the tiger's cubs, the hunter prepares a fast horse and steals the tiger's entire litter, and rides away, changing to fresh horses as necessary. The tiger, seeing that her cubs are gone, tracks them by scent and chases the hunter. When the hunter sees the tiger catching up, he drops one cub. The tiger stops to pick up the cub before resuming the chase. The hunter repeats this ruse until he reaches his ship; in this way he escapes with at least one of the cubs, leaving the tiger to rage impotently on the shore.
