The stereotypical image of “barbarians” in furs and leather pouring out of the frozen north isn’t really very accurate. Most of the barbarians who entered Roman territory had long associations with Rome. The Goths, for example, who captured the city of Rome in 410, had been been Roman allies as well as Roman enemies, on and off, for two centuries at that point; [Alaric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_I) also bore the Roman rank of _magister militum_ , sort of a 5-star general. His successor [Ataulf ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataulf)actually married a daugher of the imperial family. Other “barbarians” — particularly those with military talent and political skills — were able to operate freely at high levels of Roman society.

This was possible largely because the “barbarians” were part - even if a peripheral part - of the Roman world before they crossed the border. Trade, diplomacy and immigration bound the different sides of the line even though the relations were not always peaceful. That meant that the religious and social changes inside the Empire percolated outwards.

_These Roman-looking fellows are “barbarians” —the half-Goth, half-Alan_ _[Aspar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspar)_ _and his son Ardabur, who in this picture is holding the Roman office of praetor (mis-spelled, since this is Constantinople in 434 and Latin is losing ground to Greek)._ 

Some nations were already converted before entering Roman territory en masse. The Goths, for example, had their own version of the Bible (translated into their own characters by [Ulfilas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulfilas)) by around 350, only a generation after Christianity was legalized in Roman territory. The Goths, though, tended to be of the [Arian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism)* rather than the Orthodox persuasion — which was often a source of friction with the Orthodox Romans. In this period the line between theological controversy and political parties is very hard to find, and adhering to the wrong view of Divine Essence or Original Sin was as socially significant as having the wrong views on abortion or gun control are today. One of the reasons the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals) have such a bad name is that they were very enthusiastic Arians, given to harassing their Orthodox subjects — who were the ones who wrote the histories that come down to us. Often when historical sources from the 5th -7th century talk about ‘converting ‘ a barbarian they’re really talking about converting them from Arianism to Orthodoxy.

_A great illustration of the complexities… the_ _[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Sant%27Apollinare_Nuovo)_ _was built as an Arian church by Theoderic the Ostrogoth around 504. Would you class this as “barbarian art?”_ 

Other groups retained their traditional beliefs. A few years before Alaric’s invasion of Italy [Radagaisus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radagaisus), another Goth but also an ardent pagan, swept down out of the north claiming he would burn the city of Rome and sacrifice the Senate to his gods; but he was stopped by a Roman army under the Romanized (but also Orthodox) Vandal general [Stilicho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho). Missionary activity on the outer fringes of the Roman world was frequently dangerous - Ulfilas, for example, fled to Roman territory to translate his Bible, in fear of the Gothic king [Athanaric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanaric) who was a bitter anti-Christian) The Saxons were particularly staunch in their traditional belief until they were conquered by Charlemagne around 800. The Saxons were unusual in that they more or less annihilated the Roman (and Christian) civilization they conquered. Almost all of the other groups that came into the empire assimilated rapidly into Roman society, adopting the languages, laws and religion of their Roman neighbors.

Frequently it was women who were the first converts, since they were less tied to the traditional warrior codes of most Germanic societies. The Franks are usually said to have converted under [Clovis ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_I)around 500, but the real instigator was his wife, St. [Clotilde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clotilde), who worked for years to convert her warrior husband.



* Arian with an ‘i’, after the Arius the theologian; no connection to Aryan-with-a-y racial stuff.
