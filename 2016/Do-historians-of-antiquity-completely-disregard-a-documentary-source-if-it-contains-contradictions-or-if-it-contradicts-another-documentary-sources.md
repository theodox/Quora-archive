Absolutely not. The whole job consists of sifting through the inevitable contradictions and proposing interpretations which accord as well as possible with the evidence we have (which, as any ancient historian will tell you, is woefully scarce).

If you spend any time with the sources you very quickly learn that no source is completely reliable, completely unbiased, and empirically 'correct' -- between the inevitable differences in viewpoint and agenda, the vagaries of transmission and scribal error, and the imperfect flow of information in the ancient world there is an irreducible amount of debate that goes on. If you tried to rely only on sources which contained neither internal nor external contradictions you'd have so little to work with you'd be better off sticking to stamp collecting (and even there: [Inverted Jenny ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_Jenny)anyone?).

That is absolutely __not__  to say that there everything is up for grabs and it's all a matter of interpretation, There are a wide range of tools and techniques that have been evolving for the last 500 years which can reduce the level of uncertainty to manageable levels. It certainly helps a lot to know who an author was and why he was writing; how close he was to the events in question; whether or not he's borrowing from another source and if so, how faithfully; and how good our manuscript tradition is. It's also a good idea to be able to actually read the original languages: every translation is also a distortion. 

 Above all, no author, modern or ancient, is a free-floating observer without a fixed viewpoint; you need to know that Livy is a proud Roman patriot; that Thucydides is bitter about his treatment by Athens; that Caesar was writing to make himself look good, or that Procopius played both sides of the fence in a Kremlinesque political environment. Even a scrap of bureaucratic papyrus may be a priceless glimpse of unvarnished truth -- or it may a be as mendacious as the economic statistics from Pravda. 

In short - there's no magic to it: you should apply the same set of skeptical lenses you'd take to versions of the same story reported on Fox and MSNBC. It's only harder to do because the issues are not a constant part of your daily environment and you need to be more conscious about your efforts to get at the truth. 

In any case even texts with overt biases contain a lot of useful information. Even texts with obvious agendas were, after all, attempting to persuade people -- the most mendacious ancient authors still had to face an audience that was, of course, far better informed of the realities of life back then than we are; they had a wide variety of motivations but "getting caught out in obvious blunders" was rarely one of them. History literally begins with people calling out each other's factual "errors" -- Herodotus borrowed liberally from [Hecataeus of Miletus](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/hecataeus-of-miletus/), but was always willing to call out his predecessor for mistakes; while Herodotus himself was being picked apart by Thucydides a generation after his death and was a common target for complaints throughout antiquity. Ancient writers were no more inclined than modern ones to agree about everything in nice, tidy ways. 

The case of Herodotus also offers a really good example of why it's a good idea to approach any ancient text with some reserved judgemens. For centuries people have laughed at some of Herodotus's stories and deemed him too credulous -- but some of his oddest claims have actually turned out to be possible. He tells of giant ants which dig gold out of the ground in India, for example, which sounds pretty ridiculous (it should be pointed out that he does mark this as a 'traveller's tale'). However it has recently been noted that there is a [species of marmot](http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodotus/hist06.htm) in Kashmir which does, apparently, get gold dust on its fur -- and the locals do, apparently, raid their nests for gold dust. It's not "proven" that Herodotus was right, but he has not as wrong as many modern and ancient critics believed based on their own ideas about plausibility or his character. 

That is just how things work in ancient history -- there's a lot to try and sleuth out and the best you can do is make a strong case and expose your sources for others to pick at.
