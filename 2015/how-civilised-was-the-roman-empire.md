It would be nice if Quora had a "loaded questions" tag, since this one's a doozy. Civilized means a lot of different things, and many of them are highly subjective.

In the narrowest sense it just means "living in cities", as opposed to nomadism or a dispersed rural lifestyle. In _that_  sense the Roman world was very civilized, in a way that the Mongols or the Zulus were not, simply because their settlement patterns and economy favored cities and urban life. Everywhere they went the Romans imposed a city-centric view of life; they were tended to disdain nomadic and pastoral lifestyles and believed that people who lived away from others were primitive, impoverished and incapable of living a fulfilling life. 

In a somewhat broader way, civilized contrasts a complex, articulated society with a broad range of possibilities -- social, political, economic and intellectual -- with a simpler one where the range of roles is very narrow. This one is tricky because it involves a question of scale. Taken as a whole, the Roman world was extraordinarily rich and varied: at its height it involved people from hundreds of different ethnic groups across a huge territory from the North Sea to the Red Sea. For many people it offered incredible opportunities (not only to ethnic Romans: the Roman world produced people like[ Lucian of Samosata](https://lucianofsamosata.info/), an Assyrian from modern Iraq who wrote brilliant satires in Greek on the politics of Rome and gave lectures in Italy and Gaul; or the half-Berber, half-Greek antiquarian and naturalist [Juba of Mauretania ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II)who corresponded with scholars from Morocco to Turkey). Of course, those possibilities were not equally distributed: the wealthy and well-connected could travel, study, conduct business or pursue their educations in a vibrant, cosmopolitan world, but most people were still peasant farmers or slaves with very narrow horizons. Compared to many societies (ancient and even modern) Rome offered significant social mobility -- it was a common complaint of disgruntled aristocrats the Roman society was overrun by foreigners and parvenus -- but it was still an agricultural and more importantly a slave society in which the majority of the people were not free to choose their own destinies.


Of course the most common, if also the least useful, meaning of 'civilized' is simply as a proxy for 'admirable'. That one is infinitely arguable, since their is so much room for both differences of opinion and for the impossible job of deciding how to weigh the contradictions and failures of any society.

The elegant salons of Pompeii certainly seem 'civilized' -- but[ brutality of the gladiatorial arena](https://www.quora.com/Were-colosseum-battles-really-as-bloody-and-deadly-as-theyre-portrayed-to-be-in-the-modern-media-were-they-more-like-sporting-events-and-why) hardly seems to merit the word. 

 Rome was a conquering empire -- but one which granted equal citizenship to the conquered and which uncomplainingly accepted emperors from a dozen different nationalities. 

Romans prided themselves on the majesty [of their legal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Juris_Civilis), which remained a model for well over two thousand years -- but the Roman empire was more often than not [a military dictatorship run by self-appointed generalissimos](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires). 

Rome lauded poets and philosophers, creating lasting works that still inspire and challenge readers today; it also wiped several notable cities off of the map, including Carthage, Corinth, and Jerusalem. 

Its hard not to remember that throughout it all a significant slice of the population were slaves who could be worked to death, sexually abused, or left to starve on a whim -- but its also true that Roman law eventually granted significant legal protections to slaves, and that many slaves ended up free (and some quite wealthy and powerful).

_Both eminently Roman. How to judge between them?_

Passing judgement on all of that -- on more than two thousand years for most of the mediterranean world. on uncounted millions of people good, bad and indifferent -- is a question that's interesting to ponder but impossible to answer.
