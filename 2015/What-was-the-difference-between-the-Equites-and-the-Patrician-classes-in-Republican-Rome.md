This changed over time. Originally patricians were a hereditary aristocracy with exclusive control the political and military institutions. Over time they lost their monopoly and plain old wealth became more and more important for social status.

In very early Rome, equites were almost synonymous with patricians, however by by the 5th century BC equestrian status was defined by wealth instead of heredity. Any citizen male above a certain level of property was an eques (this was suppose to be audited in the census, about every five years). This originally represented the amount of property needed to support a cavalryman on campaign; later on the qualification went up until it represented a substantial fortune. 

You had to be an Eques to run for political office or hold high military command. Once you had held office you became a senator (for life, unless expelled for dropping below the property qualification or becoming a public scandal.). Senators had a different legal status -- they could not engage in some kinds of business, for example, but they also had special legal rights. Even though all senators were one-time equites, the Romans usually said _equites_ to mean "rich people who were not in politics" while senators meant "rich people who were in politics"; these two groups were socially similar but politically and legally separate and sometimes had different interests. For example the equites made a lot of money off of the tax-farming industry: a consortium of equites would pay the taxes for province X and then go collect their debts (plus fees). This was a great way to make money but also extremely unpopular in the provinces, and senators with strategic or political ambitions might come into conflict with equites who wanted a free hand to squeeze the provincials. 

 In early Rome political office was exclusive to men who had both the property of a eques and patrician descent. In historic times (particularly after the 5th and 4th centuries BC) the patricians lost their monopoly and non-patrician rich people could hold office. By the end of the republic, only a few offices (mostly some priesthoods) remained purely patrician. Like the European nobility in the 19th century the patricians remained socially influential and powerful but they were no longer the only people who could hold office or own landed property. Under Augustus and later -- when the Senate stopped being politically important -- senatorial status effectively became just a higher property qualification. The civil wars of Caesar and Augustus, followed by the various purges under the Julio-claudian emperors, devastated the traditional aristocracy: by the third century or thereabouts 'patrician' became a purely honorary title that didn't reflect a connection with the traditional Roman aristocracy. It survived as an appointive title down to the end of the Byzantine empire.
