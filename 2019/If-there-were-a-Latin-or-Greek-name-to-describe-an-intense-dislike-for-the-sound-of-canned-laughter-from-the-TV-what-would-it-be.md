You could try _mesochorophobia_ or _misomesochoria._ A _mesochorus_  was originally more or less a conductor or choral leader, as the name suggests, but eventually the word came to apply to the leader of a theater claque: a paid group generated applause and cheers in a Greek theater, the epitome of antique “astroturfing.” The _miso-_  variant expresses intense dislike; the _-phobia_ is of course familiar.

You could also try _keramidophobia._ Literally that would be “fear of ceramic roof tiles” — but in antiquity “roof tiles” was one of the recognized forms of hired theater claque which insecure performers ([most famously, the Roman emperor Nero](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#ref57)) hired to fill the stands at their performances. “Roof tiles” got their name by clapping with cupped hands to the most noise. Other kinds of hired applauders were “bees,” whose job was to make approving murmurs (that would be _bombyliophobia)_ and “bricks” who clapped with the flats of their hands (_plinthophobia_ ).

Besides being a conversation piece, discussing your keramidophobia also offers a salutary chance to reflect on the role of vanity and _la_  _plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose_ in human affairs.
