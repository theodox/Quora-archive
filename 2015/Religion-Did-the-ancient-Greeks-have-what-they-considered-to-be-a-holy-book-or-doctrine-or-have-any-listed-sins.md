The short answer is no: the Greeks didn't have any central, authoritative source of moral authority -- religious or otherwise.

There were, instead, a very wide variety of religious practices all over the Greek world with no central authority or overarching doctrine holding them together and [no professional priesthood](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-there-no-priestly-class-in-ancient-Greece/answer/Steve-Theodore) to pass the doctrines along. Greek society was incredibly fragmented: The Greek world was literally never united in a single political entity until it was conquered, one piece at a time, by Rome. Compared to cultures that came before and after the Greeks were extremely prone to argument, disagreement, and debate: a trait which has ensured them a high place in the history of philosophy, but wasn't conducive to creating either a unified state or a centralized religion. 

The Greeks definitely shared some core values and they elaborated them in literature and philosophy (as some of the other answers show). The standard list of moral admonitions known as the [Delphic maxims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphic_maxims) circulated pretty widely, and commentaries on some of those are a sub-genre of Greek literature that somewhat resembles, say, the Rabbinical tradition in Judaism -- with the very important proviso that Delphic injunctions are more like a collection of good advice rather than commandments. There was a pretty strong [social consensus about being temperate and self-conscious](https://www.quora.com/What-moral-values-were-considered-most-important-in-ancient-Greece/answer/Steve-Theodore), famously embodied in the two maxims "know thyself" and "nothing to excess." But again, this was conceived of as simply the smart thing, not the Right Thing. The dominant moral code was based on aristocratic notions of honor (its' no accident that one of Socrates' debate partners defines justice as "doing good to one's friends and evil to one's enemies") rather than abstract ideas about Right and Wrong. Many philosophers did try to establish or discover universal laws of conduct -- but these were self-consciously human projects even when, as they often did, the philosophers asserted that their philosophy reflected the true will of the gods.

_One of the many inscriptions of the Delphic Maxims. Not quite the Ten Commandments._ 

There were also a lot of things which _were_  regarded as important divine commandments, but they weren't moral injunctions so much as plain old decrees: you can't enter this grove wearing animal skins, or use a knife made of steel in this ritual, or wear your hair in this fashion. Despite the philosophical radicalism of many famous Greeks, for ordinary people the main presence of divine commandments was in the form of ritual taboos. We tend to think of these the Greeks as hyper-rationalistic -- due largely to the bias in our sources -- but ordinary people took these kinds of quasi-magical injunctions quite seriously: the penalty for publicly discussing the rituals of the [Eleusinian Mysteries](http://Eleusinian Mysteries), for example, was a gory public death; the career of the brilliant Athenian general Alcibiades was destroyed when he [accused of desecrating sacred statues of penises.](https://sites.google.com/site/neoherm/mutilation)

However "Sin" -- a transgression that was believed to contravene a divine moral order -- was not a key part of Greek tradition. Most Greeks thought that piety was a good thing, and that respect for the the gods was a sign of virtue (or at least, an important sign of conventional good breeding) Socrates, famously, was put to death for _asebeia:_ literally, "impiety." Socrates was associated in the popular mind with the authors of a recent aristocratic coup, so his 'guilt' was not really based on the charges -- but it is significant that he could be charged and executed on that pretext. Philosophers and poets could debate the nature of the gods -- but to openly deny them was -- if nothing else -- usually seen as an attack on cherished local traditions and probably a sign of dangerous radicalism. Religious sentiment was very important to most Greeks. It just didn't have a clear proscriptive element.

Partly that reflects the fact that the Greeks had a difficult time trying to reconcile the many contradictory and often scurrilous stories they had inherited about the gods with a strong moral code: it takes some work to portray Zeus, famous for seducing so many mortal ladies, as the authority who condemns adultery. Plato is the best (but hardly the only) example of a Greek thinker scandalized by the stories attributed to the gods -- in the Republic he has Socrates effectively proposes to censor Homer and re-write traditional Greek religion in order to promote virtue: in practice, turning the idea that moral authority derives from God around and instead proposing to subject God to the moral authority of philosophy. 

Over time, several strands in Greek philosophy evolved in directions where the idea of sin made more sense. [Neo-Platonism](http://www.iep.utm.edu/neoplato/), by the 3rd or 4th century AD had acquired a concern with personal salvation and along with it, attitudes toward right and wrong that could rightly be described in terms of sin; and some strands of [Stoicism](http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicism/#H4) also ended up with moral absolutism (justified more often by "reason" rather than a personal god, but conceived of as inherent in human nature.) Not surprisingly several elements of Neo-Platonic and Stoic thought were found congenial by Christians in later antiquity.
