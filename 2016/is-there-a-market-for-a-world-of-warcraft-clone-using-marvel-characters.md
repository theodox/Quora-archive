The folks behind [MarvelHeroes](https://marvelheroes.com) certainly hope so, although they probably would resent the “World of Warcraft clone” label.

The WOW business model - based on monthly subscriptions - has been out of favor for several years; in the more competitive games business of today the drug of choice is F2P + microtransactions; thats how MOH2016 works. The initial release in 2013 wasn’t well received, with a metacritic in the 50′s; but several rounds of reworking seem to have made the game a more polished offering and the rebranded [Marvel Heroes 2015](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/marvel-heroes-2015) score is a more than respectable 81. [DC Universe Online](https://www.dcuniverseonline.com/register?cid=1065706&gclid=CjwKEAjwmdu5BRCg1O3a-tDY0AQSJACKPgRKjh416Twy-QYIYr0ge64MA79eUrSPlecLZNIBgZEfqhoCWhnw_wcB) follows a similar format

There have actually been several superhero-themed MMOs . [City of Heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Heroes) did pretty well for a while in the mid 00′s but was shuttered in 2012 for a variety of reasons — mostly because the gradual decline in all subscription based MMO’s hit mid-level contenders first. [Champions Online](http://www.arcgames.com/en/games/champions-online) — which actually started life as “Marvel Heroes Online” but had to change when the licensing deal fell through in 2008 — continues as an F2P action MMO with unlicensed characters.

One of the interesting sidelights of this business is the role of the IP lawyers: At one point [Marvel sued the publisher of City of Heroes](http://www.out-law.com/page-5381), alleging that the character creation system allowed players to clone copyrighted characters (to be fair, I saw at least 900 different variations on Wolverine and I myself played a huge green guy in torn purple pants whose handle was “The Infringer”). The suit was settled in 2005 but seems to have been the genesis of the first “Marvel Heroes” incarnation of _Champions._ 

Making games with licensed characters is incredibly hard — the ownership of a known figure like ‘Spiderman” may be spread in bits and pieces over several legal entities and tied to contracts signed long ago when the realities of game-making were less well understood; you may, for example, need sign-off from canon doctors in many different organizations before you can put some words in Spiderman’s mouth, or let him fight and lose against somebody else, or whatever else you might want to do to make your game better. A pal of mine was the art director on a _Lord of the Rings_ game and dealing with different legal owners of different aspect of “Tolkien-ness” was a full time job.

And compared to the lawyers, the _fans_  are even more controlling!
