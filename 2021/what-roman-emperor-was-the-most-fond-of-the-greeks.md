It’s probably a tie between Hadrian and Nero.

__Hadrian__ was a famous philhellene — among other things, he was the first Roman to really rock a faux-Classical beard since the days of the Republic. He was very proud of his Greek education; even before he became emperor he earned the nickname _graeculus_ , “the little Greek” (at least if we can believe the somewhat seedy _[Historia Augusta](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html)_ _)._ As emperor he indulged his Greek preferences by having himself initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries, and by presiding over the Olympics (he took the title of “Olympicus”).

But Hadrian was not the first emperor to indulge in Greek posturing. __Nero__ didn’t attach himself quite as successfully to the Greek tradition: his own [efforts to compete in the Olympic games](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/TB025EN.html) were regarded as scandalous — both their Greek cultural stylings and his pathetic efforts to look like a great Olympian were intensely unpopular with Romans (at least, with the kind of Romans who wrote our sources.) Greek traditionalists were not amused either when he moved the date of the Olympic festival — a continuous tradition going back more than seven centuries — to suit his own schedule. On the other hand, Roman chauvinism was a stronger force in Nero’s day than in Hadrian’s: a century of imperial rule had definitely diluted the “Roman” character of the imperial ruling class — you might give Nero a few extra points for sailing against the wind.

Interestingly there’s reason to believe that it was Nero, not Hadrian, who really captured the hearts of this Greek world. After his death, [the peculiar legend that Nero was going to come back from the dead ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_Redivivus_legend)was surprisingly widespread in the Greek-speaking parts of the empire; evidently it survived into the fifth century.
