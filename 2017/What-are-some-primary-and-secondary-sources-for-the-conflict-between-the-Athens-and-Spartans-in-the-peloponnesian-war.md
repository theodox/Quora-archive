The contemporary primary sources consist mostly of [Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides) and [Xenophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon), although there are a bunch of literary works from the war period which bear on the popular perception of the conflict, particularly in the works of [Aristophanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes). There are also epigraphic records, like the [Athenian Tribute Lists](http://fromstonetoscreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ATLbackground.pdf), but there’s not much: the only records that survive from this period are those that are literally carved in stone; a lot of what little there is collected in [Archaic Times to the End of the Peloponnesian War](http://amzn.to/2hkfguy) by Charles Fornara.

There are also “secondary primary” — ie, ancient, but non-contemporary — sources. The most famous are [Diodorus Siculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus), a historian from the first century BC, and [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch), a biographer from the mid-second century AD. Bits and pieces of related info are scattered around in various fragments and quotations.

For modern secondary sources, there’s quite a lot: this is a well studied conflict. Donald Kagan’s [The Peloponnesian War](https://www.amazon.com/Peloponnesian-War-Donald-Kagan/dp/0142004375) is a good place to start — Kagan is the dean of Peloponessian war studies in English. Victor Davis Hansens’ [War Like No Other](https://www.amazon.com/War-Like-Other-Athenians-Peloponnesian/dp/0812969707/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0812969707&pd_rd_r=20V3ZF8AXMKVAA6RDHMY&pd_rd_w=HAqh9&pd_rd_wg=b8G1z&psc=1&refRID=20V3ZF8AXMKVAA6RDHMY) is a very military-history oriented look, if you’re looking for a miltary-technical perspective. I haven’t read [A New History of the Peloponnesian War ](http://amzn.to/2yG0WUA)by Lawrence Trittle but it bills itself as aimed at non-classicists.
