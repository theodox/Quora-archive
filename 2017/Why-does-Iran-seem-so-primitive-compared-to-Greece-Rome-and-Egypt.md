The question might be put better as _seems primitive to you._ 

In antiquity, at any rate, Persia (in its various incarnations under the Achaemenids, Parthians, and Sassanids was a wealthy and sophisticated place. The Greeks themselves — who had reasons not to be overly kind to the Persians — always referred to the Persian emperor as “The Great King”; even though they defined themselves in opposition to a lot of what they saw in Persian culture they couldn’t help respect the majesty of the Persian monarchy and the might of the Persian empire. They also tended to hunger after Persian gold, which financed quite a few of the wars and monuments of classical Greece. The Persians were one of the Great Powers of the ancient world — before and after Alexander’s conquests they were one of the most powerful and influential ancient cultures. Perhaps just as noteworthy, the were formidable antagonists to the Romans for more than half a millennium — they were the only neighbor state that Rome had to treat as an equal.

So they were hardly “primitive”. However, unlike the Greeks and Romans _we don’t know them first hand_ . We have quite a lot of Greek and Roman and even Egyptian literature, but have very little pre-Islamic Persian literature apart from the [Avesta](http://www.avesta.org/) (which isn’t super approachable for the non-specialist). Between three centuries of Greek influence after Alexander’s conquest and a deliberate effort in the early Islamic period to root out literature that smacked of Zoroastrianism or other non-Islamic religions, _[there are almost no native Persian voices from before the 9th century or so](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iran-viii1-persian-literature-pre-islamic)_ _._ 

It also doesn’t help that ancient Persia’s periods of power usually saw Persians ruling over large, polyglot empires where other languages were the way a lot of people expressed themselves. The Persian elite were military aristocrats ruling over a wide range of subject people who continued to live their lives in a very different cultural style without much interference from above. Among the writers who would have been “Persian” if you had to go by the colors on the map would be famous names like [Herodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus) and[ Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus); the authors of the Biblical books of [Esther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Esther), [Tobit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Tobit), and [Ezra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Ezra) as well as parts of the [Talmud](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/talmud-persian-elements-in-2); and many anonymous authors in Egyptian, Aramaic and Babylonian.

Because none of these people wrote in Persian, about “Persian” subject matter, we don’t count them as reflecting Persian culture — even though the political and economic framework under which they all lived and wrote was a Persian creation. If you did include all the cultural work produced under Persian rule, you’d see everything from Greek philosophy to Babylonian astronomy to Egyptian temple-building to Biblical commentaries. But — since the Persians tended to impose only their taxes and not their culture on subject people the obvious marks of cultural “success” aren’t as obvious in their case.

It is also worth pointing out that a lot of Greek and Roman cultural touchstones have strong Persian influences. There was more interchange than you might think. One of the most popular works of Greek educational literature was the [Cyropaedia, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyropaedia)which pretended at least to be about the boyhood of the Persian emperor Cyrus the Great. When the Persian victory over Rome at [Carrhae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carrhae) was announced to the Parthian emperor Orodes, he was watching a performance of Euripides’ _Bacchae_ ; and when Justinian closed the Academy of Athens the remaining philosophers fled to the court of Persian emperor Khosrow. And Persia was the birthplace of religions like Mithriasm and Manichaeism which spread widely in the Greco-Roman world.

So, in short, the relative poverty of Iran or Persia is an illusion. The impression owes far more to the accidents of literary survival than to the historical realities of antiquity.
