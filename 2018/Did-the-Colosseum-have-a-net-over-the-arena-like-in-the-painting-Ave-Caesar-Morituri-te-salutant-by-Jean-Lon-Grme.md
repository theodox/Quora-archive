That was not a net — it was the rigging for a sun awning, known as a [velarium.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velarium) We don’t have any real technical details on how it was done, although we do know that for emperor Caligula liked to torment crowds at gladiatorial shows by [ordering the velarium withdrawn](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0132%3Alife%3Dcal.%3Achapter%3D26), leaving the spectators broiling in the Roman sun.* The awnings were operated by sailors from the Roman fleet, who were experts in both ropework and managing canvas.

_A hypothetical modern reconstruction of the velarium in operation._

* Caligula’s amphitheatre was not the Colosseum, but the idea was evidently common to many Roman arenas
