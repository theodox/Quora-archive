There were connections, but they weren’t intimate. The “known world” of the Romans extended about 15 degrees south of the equator on the east and maybe 4 degrees north of the equator in the west. However the contacts were not very intensive — certainly not on the scale of the much more elaborate Roman relationships with the Near East, with India, or with Central Europe. The Sahara was not a complete barrier to the movement of people and goods — but it was a formidable obstacle nonetheless.

__Borders__ 

If you draw a line from Agadir in Morocco to Aswan in Egypt, you’ve got approximate limit of political contacts. Roman settlement and influence were generally confined to within a couple of hundred miles of the coast; the only exception is the Nile valley where the Roman border usually sat at Aswan.

There were local polities on the other side of that line who of course were familiar with their northern neighbors — but (especially since most of the “frontier” was not densely habitable) there was fairly little regular warfare or intensive diplomacy. The norm was a mix of small scale raiding and equally small-scale trading with the mostly nomadic people who lived in the habitable fringes of the Sahara. There were really only two full-blown interstate conflicts along the southern borders of the Roman empire: the short-lived Roman occupation of [Germa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germa) (in southern Libya) in the early 3d century and the [war between emperor Augustus and the queen of Meroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_relations_with_Nubia) (in modern Sudan) in the first.

__Exploration__ 

There were a few moments when military units or explorers went farther south: maybe as far as Senegal in the west, as far as lake Chad in central Africa, and as far as the Sudd in southern Sudan in the east) . There’s [more detail on times and places in this answer](https://www.quora.com/How-far-or-deep-into-Africa-did-the-Romans-reach).

However the Roman’s didn’t run their empire on the model of a 19th century enterprise: “expeditions” and “exploration” gives a somewhat anachronistic idea. Individuals — sometimes for political and sometimes for economic reasons — travelled southward but the practice wasn’t really institutionalized. It’s not uncommon to find a piece of apocryphal information from the Greek writer Herodotus (~ 450 BC) being recycled verbatim in a Roman geographical work five centuries later: a tribute to the sluggish flow of information. As far as we know, no Roman ever set out to circumnavigate Africa, even though Herodotus recorded a story (widely doubted in antiquity, but most likely true) o[f a Phoenician expedition which sailed from the Red Sea all the way around to Carthage in the sixth century BC.](https://www.quora.com/Did-Ancient-Egyptians-circumnavigate-the-continent-of-Africa-How-difficult-is-it/answer/Steve-Theodore)

__East Africa__ 

Rome inherited Ptolemaic Egypt’s discovery of [a viable sea-route to India](https://www.quora.com/Did-any-Roman-during-the-Roman-Republic-or-Empire-set-foot-in-India/answer/Steve-Theodore). This created a thriving trade across the Indian Ocean — with the added bonus of bypassing the rival Parthian and Sassanid empires, who sat squarely across the land trade routes to the east. While the core of the trade was oriented towards southern India, the booming maritime industry passing through the Horn of Africa eventually touched a lot of the East African coast.

From modern Eritrea down to at least as far as modern Tanzania, there was a fairly robust and routine trade in spices, ivory, gold and exotic animals. The most valuable component was the spices, particularly cinnamon, cassia, and myrrh from modern Somalia and Ethiopia. The Roman naturalist Pliny has a vivid account of the lengths to which the people of what is today Eritrea went to to get their spices to market:

> [they] convey it over the wide seas in ships that are neither steered by rudders nor propelled by oars or drawn by sails, nor assisted by any device of art: in those regions only man and man's boldness stands in place of all these things. Moreover they choose the winter sea about the time of the shortest day, as an east wind is then chiefly blowing. This carries them on a straight course through the bays, and after rounding a cape a west-north-west wind brings them to the harbour of the Gebbanitae called Ocilia [in southwestern Arabia]. On this account that is the port most resorted to by these people, and they say that it is almost five years before the traders return home and that many perish on the voyage.

_[Pliny, Natural History, 12.42](https://topostext.org/work/153)_ 

The trouble was worth it, because cinnamon was extraordinarily valuable — quoted prices ran as high as 1500 denarii per pound, about the price of five year’s skilled labor.

There was also a slave trade in east Africa, but that seems only to have become prominent later — after the fourth century or so. This might reflect the demographic troubles of the empire after the plagues of the third century, or perhaps the warfare that attended the rise of the [Axumite Empire](https://kcts9.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/65020a47-68b4-457d-a4e7-0bf306450605/the-aksum-kingdom-trade-and-ancient-africa/), based in modern Ethiopia. Trade around the Horn of Africa proper was mostly controlled by Axumites, farther down the coast were trading posts belonging to various South Arabian states. The only Roman military foothold south of Egypt was a naval base in the [Farasan Islands](https://havechanged.blogspot.com/2017/10/the-farthest-outpost.html), tasked with customs and anti-piracy patrols in the Red Sea. At roughly the latitude of Khartoum, this was the southernmost patch of ground ever claimed by Rome — 4,000 miles south of Hadrian’s Wall.

The left hand side shows the coast of east Africa from the Red Sea down to the limits of Roman knowledge, about 15 degrees south of the Equator. The markers on that coast indicate known trading posts, mostly controlled by the Axumite empire or various Arabian kingdoms.

The southernmost Roman record of a sailing to the south refers to the “Cape of Leeks”, said to be 15 degrees south of the equator. The largest major trading destination for Greek or Roman sailors was [Rhapta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhapta), which hasn’t been conclusively identified but is [most likely near the delta of the Rufiji River in Tanzania](https://atavist.mg.co.za/finding-rhapta/). South of the spice-lands near the Horn of Africa, ivory, tortoise-shell and exotic animals were the primary commodities.

__West Africa__ 

On the west coast, however, seaborne trade was less developed. Before their conquest by the Romans, the Carthaginians had sailed south in search of trading opportunities — as early as the sixth century BC [Hanno the Navigator](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/hanno-1-the-navigator/) explored the Atlantic coast as far south as Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. Small scale trade continued up and down the coast in Roman times but it was much smaller in scale than the equivalent trade on the east coast of the continent; we only very sketchy records of place names and notable sights, not the more detailed economic information we have for the eastern coast.

The southernmost coordinate that shows in Roman geography seems to be the “Hesperian gulf”, what we’d call the Gulf of Guinea, so a few degrees north of the Equator. A [handful of Roman coins](http://www.strangehistory.net/2015/02/10/roman-coin-congo/) are the only identifiable traces of contact on the west coast, and there’s no way to be sure how or when they arrived.

__Central Africa__ 

[Trade did cross the Sahara during Roman times,](https://www.caitlingreen.org/2017/10/saharan-and-trans-saharan-contacts.html) but it was smaller in volume and sophistication than it would be after the Arab conquests. The prime pathway led through the desert kingdom of the Garamantes in southern Libya. During periods when their relationship with Roman Africa was friendly, they acted as middlemen on a route which connected the Mediterranean with the upper Niger area (unsurprisingly, near the later caravan destination of Timbuktu, Mali). The distribution of Roman goods — common in the Garamantian oasis of Germa, but much rarer farther south — suggests that the trade proceeded through various local sub-networks: it’s unlikely that many Romans personally made the trip to Mali, or many Malians made the reverse trip.

In addition to the usual African staples (exotic animals, precious metals, and ivory) there was a trade in slaves, which the Garamantes captured from farther south.

One big obstacle to intensive cross-Sahara trade in this period was the fact that none of the potential customers on the far side of the Sahara used gold or silver coinage. Unlike the cash-fueled Indian Ocean trade the caravan routes required barter. We find Roman glass beads in Mali, indicating their popularity as a trade item. Only high-value, compact commodities were worth transporting across the desert by land.

Overall, Roman contact with the world on the far side of the Sahara was real but strictly limited.

On the western side of the continent, there was a trickle of activity but the “known world” really ended around the border of modern day Morocco. In the central Sahara, trade mediated by the Garamantes reached as far as Lake Chad and Niger, but most of it was not conduced by Romans themselves. On the east coast there was a more developed seaborne trade which reached as far south as Tanzania and which tied east Africa into a complex web of trade that reached all the way to Southeast Asia, prefiguring the pattern that would become better known after the Arab conquests. On the whole, though, if you asked a Roman about exotic trade destinations they’d be much more likely to speak of India, and on its farther side exotic destinations like Serica (China) or Cattigara (Vietnam) than of Africa.

_This map is covers the roughly the era of Justinian (mid 6th-century) but it gives a graphic example of the density of Roman finds outside the empire. Africa’s share is considerably smaller than those of India, China, Central Asia or even Ireland, which was never part of the Roman empire.
