I've done some teaching of kids in this area, including my own. Six is pretty young for programming - only a _very_ few kids will be able to manage the abstractions involved in traditional programming, particularly in a system like Unity or PyGame which requires typing. 

I have seen kids work pretty successfully with more limited frameworks in the 8-9 year age bracket. Scratch, mentioned in one of the other answers, is a fun start -- Most kids will hook up a sprite to some sounds or an animation and leave it be, but it's a stretch. Multimedia Fusion isn't too challenging for kids who already are familiar with PC computing)

One easily overlooked way in is _Minecraft_ . It's very tactile and immediate, which kids love. Creative mode allows them them to build things (and, like lego, the severely limited palette makes it easier to do something 'pretty good' since there' no way to do 'perfect'. My 5 year old can set up interesting behaviors using pressure plates and redstone. Unfortunately the CraftBukkit kerfuffle has thrown a big wrench into the otherwise very vibrant minecraft community, but you can do very simple Minecraft modding using Python and either the Raspberry Pi version of Minecraft or -- if you can find one, despite all the lawyers -- using CraftBukkit and Raspberry Juice
