As usual in ancient history, a lot depends on what you decide to include as evidence.

As far as the literary evidence goes, the author closest in time to Hannibal’s career is Polybius, who wrote two generations after Hannibal. Polybius was born about twenty years after Hannibal crossed they Alps. He was in his teens when Hannibal died in far-off Asia Minor, and didn’t take up his pen for another couple of decades.

There were originally several contemporary historians who chronicled Hannibal’s exploits at first hand ([Sosylus of Lacedaemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosylus_of_Lacedaemon) and [Silenus of Caleacte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silenus_Calatinus) were friendly with Hannibal; [Q. Fabius Pictor ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Fabius_Pictor)and [L. Cincius Alimentus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cincius_Alimentus)on the Roman side). None of these works survive — we only know of them because they were quoted in later writers we do have, such as Polybius, Livy, Appian, or Cornelius Nepos.

So, if you were constitutionally inclined to conspiracy theories or had a deep seated need to believe Hannibal was not historical, you could make much hash out of this somewhat embarrassing fact. If you wanted to lay it on particularly thick, you could also lean on the fact that actual manuscripts for our surviving accounts are usually much later: [the oldest physical copy of Polybius comes from the 10th century](http://www.mss.vatlib.it/guii/console?service=shortDetail&id=205050).

So — if you were a diehard skeptic, you could make the case that Hannibal was another invention of those scheming medieval monks. You’d have to do a little fancy footwork there: Livy wrote much later than Polybius, but [the oldest copies of his work are much earlier](https://www.quora.com/When-were-the-books-of-Titus-Livy-first-discovered/answer/Steve-Theodore) — a few short pieces can be found from the fourth century, a mere six hundred years after Hannibal’s supposed career. Nonetheless, this kind of argumentation is bread and butter for a lot of ancient conspiracy theorists.



In this case, however, one does not have to respond with [a long explanation about paucity of surviving ancient sources or the vagaries of manuscript tradition](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-scholars-use-Greek-sources-like-Homer-and-Herodotus-when-studying-ancient-history-even-though-not-a-single-manuscript-has-been-found-that-was-actually-written-by-them/answer/Steve-Theodore). If all you did was google Hannibal primary sources, you’d be quite correct to note that this fellow — at least a tie for the title of “most important figure of his age” — has not, in fact, got any contemporary literary mentions. For an ancient general raised on dreams of glory, this must be intensely frustrating: drag your goddam elephants over the Alps, chase the Romans from one end of Italy to the other, cruise around the Mediterranean _[firing freaking poisonous snakes from your catapults](https://sites.psu.edu/hannibal/allies/)_  and what do you get? Crickets!

However, as slightly exasperated ancient historians will labor to explain, _this is how the game is played._ The lack of sources is a crying shame — but it’s part and parcel of the way all ancient history has to be approached. We’re assembling a jigsaw puzzle with many, many missing pieces and the essence of the art is trying to fill in the blanks as carefully — but also as tentatively — as appropriate. The absence of contemporary eye-witness accounts is the _norm_ for most of ancient history. Learning how to work with the fragmentary, mutilated pieces of evidence that survive requires a lot of patience (and the ability to admit your limitations). Above all, it takes a dab hand at estimating relative probabilities. Is it possible that somebody really would invent this charismatic-yet-morally-ambiguous figure and insert him into the historical record for sinister purposes of their own….? Perhaps_._ 

Is it _likely?_  No, it’s not.

In this case you can demonstrate that quite clearly with two — though only two! — pieces solid archaeological evidence. These are the only two surviving contemporary mentions of Hannibal.

The point here is not simply “_checkmate, Hannibal deniers!_ ”

The archaeology in this case merely confirms what a 17th century scholar who didn’t have either of these pieces would have guessed: that the web of cross-textual references and historical memories which grew up around Hannibal had a solid historical core, even if most of the words which reach us were written long after his death. If nobody had found that Etruscan tomb, if the Fabius epitaph had been re-used, face down, as a paving stone the textual situation would be the same.

It’s comforting to have this physical touchstone but it’s also _rare —_ the spotty textual record is the norm in antiquity. Polybius claims to have read a large inscription erected by Hannibal at the temple of Juno in Croton, which told the story from the Carthaginian side in Greek and Punic. Unfortunately this monument has not come down to us — even bronze tablets (so attractive to recyclers down the ages) are fragile vessels for historical information. For that reason have to assess the veracity of ancient accounts as part of a complex network of evidence… not like some cheap history-channel gotcha piece.
