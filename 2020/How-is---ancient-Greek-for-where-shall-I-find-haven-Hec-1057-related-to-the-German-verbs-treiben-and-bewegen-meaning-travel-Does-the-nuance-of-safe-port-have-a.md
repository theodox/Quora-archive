# How is "πᾷ κέλσω", ancient Greek for "where shall I find haven" (Hec.1057), related to the German verbs "treiben" and "bewegen", meaning "travel"? Does the nuance of safe port have a correlation with the idea of navigation in general?

κέλσω comes from __[κέλλω](https://lsj.gr/wiki/%CE%BA%CE%AD%CE%BB%CE%BB%CF%89)__ __,__ the word you’d use for beaching a ship. Since most Greek mariners had to run their ships onto the beach at night (tying up at the dock was a luxury) the idea of “landing” was deeply tied up with the physical action of actually running the ship onto the shingle.

The imagery here is all about _footing_ — Polymnestor is floundering around trying to get a toehold. You can see it looking at the verbs and also at the emphasis on “four-footed beast in 1058:

> ὤμοι ἐγώ, πᾷ βῶ,

> Alas for me — where can put a foot down [[βῶ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=bw%3D&la=greek&can=bw%3D0&prior=pa=|&d=Perseus:text:1999.01.0097:card=1056&i=1#lexicon)]?

> πᾷ στῶ, πᾷ κέλσω;

> where can I stand [here’s [στῶ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=stw%3D&la=greek&can=stw%3D0&prior=pa=|&d=Perseus:text:1999.01.0097:card=1056&i=1#lexicon)]? Where run ashore [κέλσω]?

> τετράποδος βάσιν θηρὸς ὀρεστέρου

> (my reward [[ἐπίχειρα](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=e%29pi%2Fxeira&la=greek&can=e%29pi%2Fxeira0&prior=tiqe/menos&d=Perseus:text:1999.01.0097:card=1056&i=1#lexicon), below]) the stance [[βάσιν](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ba%2Fsin&la=greek&can=ba%2Fsin0&prior=tetra/podos&d=Perseus:text:1999.01.0097:card=1056&i=1)] of a four-footed mountain animal

> τιθέμενος ἐπίχειρα κατ᾽ ἴχνος;

> planted [[τιθέμενος](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=tiqe%2Fmenos&la=greek&can=tiqe%2Fmenos0&prior=o)reste/rou&d=Perseus:text:1999.01.0097:card=1056&i=1#lexicon)] on their track

The root κελ- probably comes from and old IE root meaning to “drive” or “push”; it’s usually said to be cognate with Latin _[celer](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=celer&la=la&can=celer0#lexicon)_  where the conventional meaning of ‘swift’ is derived from the idea of being driven or hurried or urged. So here I think the import of the original is _urgency;_ the related verbs __[κέλομαι](https://lsj.gr/wiki/%CE%BA%CE%AD%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B1%CE%B9)__ ____ and __[κελεύω](https://lsj.gr/wiki/%CE%BA%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B5%CF%8D%CF%89)__ ____ are used for expression of command or constraint. That’s where _antrieben_  comes in. In this context there’s a background image of the officers yelling and hustling the crew of a ship as they haul it on to the shore through the surf — a difficult and arduous job.
