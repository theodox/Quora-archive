# In Ancient Rome, were crowds in the Coliseum rooting for the gladiators or the imported exotic animals (alligators, tigers, etc) to win?

The answer will of course vary for individuals. Roman crowds were notoriously fickle as well - baying for blood one moment, weeping with sentiment the next.

Pliny, who was very fond of elephants, recorded a particularly pathetic spectacle (_[Historia Naturalis, VIII.7](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D7)_ );

> In the second consulship of Pompeius, at the dedication of the temple of Venus Victrix, twenty elephants, or, as some say, seventeen, fought in the Circus against a number of Gætulians, who attacked them with javelins. One of these animals fought in a most astonishing manner; being pierced through the feet, it dragged itself on its knees towards the troop, and seizing their bucklers, tossed them aloft into the air: and as they came to the ground they greatly amused the spectators, for they whirled round and round in the air, just as if they had been thrown up with a certain degree of skill, and not by the frantic fury of a wild beast.… When, however, the elephants in the exhibition given by Pompeius had lost all hopes of escaping, they implored the compassion of the multitude by attitudes which surpass all description, and with a kind of lamentation bewailed their unhappy fate. So greatly were the people affected by the scene, that, forgetting the general altogether, and the munificence which had been at such pains to do them honour, the whole assembly rose up in tears, and showered curses on Pompeius, of which he soon afterwards became the victim*

Another variable was the nature of the people in the rings. Hunts or _venationes_  could pit professionals against animals — dangerous or not — in a demonstration of skill. As with the top-billing gladiator bouts these were watched carefully and attracted the attention of fans who followed the techniques and careers of individuals. In these kinds of contests, a popular _venator_  was probably a crowd favorite, particularly if the match was not obviously rigged in favor of the human participants.

As time went on, however, the games involved more and more novel forms of execution for a variety of crimes — that’s where the stereotype of ‘throwing Christians to the lions’ comes from. In cases like that the sympathies of the crowd would depend a great deal on the nature of the crimes involved. In this form the “sporting” element is pretty much absent.

Interestingly the use of animals for executions is apparently (unlike fights between human gladiators) an import: the Carthaginians used it before the Romans, who picked up the practice around the end of the second Punic war. This might reflect that fact that they had a wider variety of dangerous animals to choose from in their home territory.
