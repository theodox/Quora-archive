# Why did the Greeks abandon most of their temples, letting them fall into ruin? Why do we find remnants of large cities deserted and abandoned, while there are populated cities all around them? What made the Greeks just stop going to these areas?

Most of the ruins we see today are in places that were basically abandoned. 

The population of the Greek and Roman world declined pretty severely from its peak in the 2d century -- in most places, the p0pulation didn't hit that peak again until the 1700s. Some cities are abandoned due to destruction like wars and natural disasters; others because of economic or political changes. 

In the areas where people stuck around, most of the temples were converted to other uses. Some became churches, others were used for storage or even as barns. The Parthenon in Athens was a church for a thousand years or so, but it was being used as an ammunition locker by the Turks when it was blown up by a Venetian artillery shell in 1687.

When you see ruins in a populated area nowadays, it's a conscious choice -- those areas are preserved as archaeological sites or tourist attractions.
