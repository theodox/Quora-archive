Traditionally, Tarquin’s reign is 24 or 25 years, from, 534 or 535 to 510 or 509 BC¹.

We don’t have any solid data on the reigns of any of the Roman kings. The thorough Gallic sack of Rome about 120 years after the founding of the Republic destroyed any records that might have provided a more accurate accounting of the Roman Kingdom. Although [archaeological evidence is consistent with the existence of a monarchy that lasted about 250 years and ended around the traditional date](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-archaeological-evidence-for-the-Roman-Kingdom/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=338494680&share=3eef5a96&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer), we’re really just repeating what Roman oral tradition passed down about those years with a collective shrug. The oldest mention of Tarquin is a quotation from the history written by [Fabius Pictor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Fabius_Pictor) around the time of Hannibal — that is, about three centuries after Tarquin’s day.²



¹ There are a few competing candidates for the timing. The fact that some historians might have chosen to end Tarquin’s reign with his expulsion and others with his abandonment of the effort to reclaim the throne makes it more wobbly.

² Pictor’s date for the foundation of Rome is different from the most commonly cited one. We usually follow the traditional date of 753 BC, but Pictor’s would be our 747.
