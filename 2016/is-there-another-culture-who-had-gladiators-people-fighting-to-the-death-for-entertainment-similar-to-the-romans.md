A lots of cultures had combat sports or martial arts which_might_  kill one of the participants, but there are few in which a lethal outcome is certain. The Greek Olympics, for example, featured the _[pankration](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/TC007cEN.html)_ , a mixed-martial arts fight which killed participants fairly often — in fact the Olympic judges eventually ruled that a pankratiast who died in the ring would automatically be declared _victor_ in order to discourage to much bloodshed. However the pankration (like most other sporting variations of real combat) did not include anything like the Roman ‘thumbs up / thumbs down’ for a defeated fighter.

There are also numerous examples of cultures where staged combats could lead to death for some kind of ritual purpose. The Roman themselves guessed that gladiatorial games had their origin in long-forgotten funeral sacrifices. But the Roman version is unique in having long outlasted whatever ritual or theological justifications gave it birth: The Roman arena of historic times, anyway, was a big, sophisticated commercial enterprise with complex logistics and a sophisticated financial infrastructure. The [reasons for it were still complex](https://www.quora.com/Why-were-the-games-important-to-the-power-of-the-emperor), but they were ultimately pragmatic and not ideological or theological.

It’s known that the Carthaginians staged fights to the death among captured Roman prisoners, and also pitted them against wild animals (including a solo combat against an elephant, which tradition says the Roman prisoner defeated single-handedly) . This probably reflects Carthaginian practice at home; at leas there’s some evidence for the animal fights as a form of judicial punishment at Carthage. However we don’t have evidence that makes a clear Carthaginian analogy to the routine commercial exhibitions in the Roman arena; it seems more closely tied to elaborate forms of execution with the sporting element removed (Hannibal had the Roman who defeated the elephant killed, even though he’d been promised his freedom if he won: pretty much the definition of “unsporting”).

The closes analogy for routine use of forced combat is in Central American cultures — the Mayans and Aztecs both had ‘blood sports’ which ended with the death of the losers; but our evidence doesn’t really allow us know how much of a role entertainment and profit played in the games. We fall back on religious or cultural explanations, because that’s how our (scanty) sources treat the subject — but it’s probable that there was a mix of motives in play.

The Mayan form of the [ōllamaliztli ball game ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_ballgame#Human_sacrifice)(_pitz_ in Mayan) ended in human sacrifice: the game was frequently ‘played’ by captives who appear to have been sacrificed after the game was ended:

It’s probably significant that the Maya epic [Popol Vuh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popol_Vuh) includes a sacrificial ball game and a decapitation as key cosmological events — however it’s hard to be sure how this reflects the practice of depicted in surviving artwork. Our version of that story was collected seven or eight centuries after the [collapse of the Classical Mayan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Maya_collapse) civilization which built the ball courts: there are many centuries for the meaning of the original game to be obscured. Maya ball courts included spectator seating — were they reserved for religious functionaries? Or were tickets sold to fans who wanted to see the action?

The Aztec version of [ōllamaliztli ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_ballgame#Human_sacrifice)definitely had aspects of a professional sport. Spectators gambled on on the outcome and many players were highly trained professionals. It’s not clear, though, that the Aztec variety involved any intentional deaths (the heavy rubber ball could be deadly — but unlike the Mayan case the evidence for human sacrifice in ōllamaliztli is ambiguous). If the game really did have mortal stakes it would be the closest analogy for the Roman arena, since it included a commercial element that we can’t be sure was part of the Maya version— but we can’t know for sure.

The Aztecs also had a practice known as [Flower wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_war), which was a ritualized form of limited warfare which ended with the sacrifice of captives. As with _pitz_ , it’s not completely clear what the balance of forces involved really was: Flower wars could be a method of avoiding all-out conflict, resolving disputes by ritual combat; a religious ritual designed to harvest captives for the Aztec gods; or something akin to a [spectator sport](http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/aztecs/Aztec-wars.pdf).

The Aztecs also had a form of human sacrifice in which [the victim was given blunted weapons and allowed to ‘fight’ against fully armed Aztect warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xipe_Totec#Human_sacrifice). Again, the mixture of motives is hard to untangle.

So — there are vague analogies in Central America, but the Romans get the prize for this particular piece of inhumanity.
