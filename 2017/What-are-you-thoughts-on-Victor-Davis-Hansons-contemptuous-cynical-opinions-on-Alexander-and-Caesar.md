I think he’s pretty clear about his opinion of military adventurers in general. Rather than sum up, it’s [easier to quote](http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/the-little-tyrant/):

> Napoleon and Alexander were money-driven thieves _par excellence_ , perhaps the difference being only that the looted imperial treasuries at Susa, Babylon, and Persepolis yielded more specie than the Swiss banks at Berne. The Great's "Brotherhood of Man" was about as genuinely utopian as the _Code Napoléon_ . Both strongmen dazzled their immediate circle with lapidary self-infatuation—for example, Napoleon's "At twenty-nine years of age I have exhausted everything. It only remains for me to become a complete egoist." Or Alexander's reply to Parmenio's urging before the battle of Gaugamela to take the terms offered by Darius III: "And I would accept them too—if I were Parmenio."

> In the end, their real legacies were millions dead and empires that crumbled the second they were gone. I suppose the only real difference was that Alexander loved horses and named a city after his steed Bucephalas, whereas Napoleon rode to death dozens of mounts and exhausted Europe of its horseflesh.

I don’t recall anything he’s ever said about Caesar, but it would be surprising if the tone were any different.

It’s easy to see how this fits into Burkean conservative politics: skepticism about world-remaking Great Men of History is close to the core of that outlook. Perhaps more importantly, Hanson is a disciple of Thucydides and of Tacitus: two grim realists who looked first at the hard realities of power, rather than the verbal justifications in which power likes to clothe itself.

Closer to the present day, Hanson is also an admirer of [Ronald Syme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Syme) and [Ernst Badian](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/07/ernst-badian/), whose approaches to ancient history were founded on profound suspicions about traditional hero worship*. Syme’s [Roman Revolution, ](http://amzn.to/2fIADET)written under the looming shadow of Hitler and Mussolini in 1939, envisioned Julius Caesar and Octavian in the mold of interwar fascists and gangsters. Badian was an escapee from Nazi Germany — his father was briefly interned in Dachau — and throughout his professional career [he regarded Alexander’s career as a ‘unifier of mankind’ in only a slightly more gentle light than Hitler’s ](http://amzn.to/2xcJKFq)(he also regarded the Roman Senate of Caesar’s day as [little more than a gang of robbers](http://amzn.to/2xXjPAw): he was an equal-opportunity critic of imperialist adventures).



* by a bit of cosmic irony, these two critics of hero-worship both studied in Christchurch, New Zealand — not far from the Shire and Mount Doom.
