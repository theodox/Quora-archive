I think this is probably a reference to the book [Black Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Athena), by Martin Bernal. It’s a [not-very-widely-accepted](https://www.quora.com/What-if-any-is-the-part-of-truth-to-Martin-Bernals-Black-Athena) argument that the roots of Greek culture were fundamentally “African” (the subtitle is ‘Afroasiatic’, but Bernal really only cares about trying to prove that Greece was a sort of colonial offshoot of Egypt). The linked question covers the ups and downs of the thesis.

As for an actual, non-hypothetical black Athenian there aren’t a lot of examples in the ancient period but there are a few. This is one:

Memnon was a pupil and adopted son of [Herodes Atticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodes_Atticus), an Athenian philosopher and statesman from the early 2d century. He went by the Greek name of _Memnon_ after a [character in the Iliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memnon_(mythology)), but we don’t know what his given name might have been, or whether he grew up in Athens or moved there as an adult.

[This one’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_funerary_relief_(NAMA_4464)) an unnamed groom, leading a horse. It’s much older, probably 4th century BC:

Unlike Memnon, this boy is probably a slave: that job was almost always performed by slaves.

There was also a vogue for decanters in the shape of African heads; it’s not clear if any of these were done from life or if they were purely conventional. This example is quite old, it’s dated to around 525 BC. Even at that early date contact with Egypt will have given Athenians some idea of what Africans looked like, though the number of African individuals actually living in Greece before the Roman period will have been quite small.
