[Panda 3D ](https://www.panda3d.org/) is a free engine that uses Python alongside a C++ core. Disney used it to make ToonTown and several other titles.

You can also use [Unity](http://unity3d.com/5?gclid=CjwKEAjw6IauBRCJ3KPXkNro1BoSJAAhXxpy0_LxrMA9_S7MchzV4H4QBCOhw-seHVhU1V-uXKh3TRoCqGnw_wcB), and do you scripting in the [ Boo](http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2015/05/boo-who.html) language, which is a strongly typed dotnet language which is almost, but not quite identical to Python (although Boo is no longer promoted by Unity it still works in Unity 5, despite what some people write on the web).
