A good contender for the oldest known personal name in history is [this cuneiform tablet](https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/archival_view.php?ObjectID=P005289):

It records the names of two slaves, named En-pap (the “X” is an unreadable sign) and Sukkal-gir (gunu indicates the hashmarks, it’s not clear what they mean in context).

This tablet dates from the [Jemdet Nasr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemdet_Nasr) period in Mesopotamia, somewhere between 2900 and 3100 BC in round numbers. We don’t know the precise legal status of these two people. In later Mesopotamia (our [first written law codes are several hundred years later](https://www.ancient.eu/Ur-Nammu/)) slave status was inheritable. On the other hand slaves could also be manumitted, and were allowed to have marry and have families. In those days most slaves will have been prisoners of war (from neighboring communities) or debtors who were enslaved to pay off their debts.
