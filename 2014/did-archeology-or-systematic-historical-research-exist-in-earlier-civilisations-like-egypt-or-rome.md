Mesopotamia was much more interested in what we would call 'archaeology' than the Greeeks, Romans, or Egyptians were. In fact, much of our knowledge of older Mesoptamian cultures (Sumer in particular, but also early Babylon, Elam and other powers) derives from the very exhaustive efforts of later kings, priests and scribes to re-copy important inscriptions. School children were taught to copy very old texts for practice, which provided both a strong sense of continuity and also helped preserve many old texts (proverbs, prayers, myths or laws) in multple copies. 

For one example, Asshurbanipal, the last emperor of Assyria, amassed a huge library of ancient texts in multiple languages (we know of more than 20,000 tablets) which forms the core of our knowledge o the literature and history of Mesopotamia -- including not only Assyrian material but Sumerian, Babylonian and I think Elamite as well.Other kings in earlier eras dd the same, scouring temple and palace archives for important documents and inscriptions. Some of this was done for propaganda purposes (to emphasize the legitimacy of a new dynasty, for example) but a lot of it seems to have been done out of curiosity and admiration. Other famous antiquarians include king Nabonidus of Babylon, and Enheduanna, daughter of Sargon the Great.

The Mesopotamian religious practice of rebuilding and restoring temples also contributed to the interest in preserving the past. Restoring or upgrading a famous temple was an act of public piety - thus good propaganda - but also an opportunity to systematically catalog the possessions and records of the older structure. When temples were rebuilt they were generally dismantled carefully, catalogued, and their foundations (and some key artifacts) were carefully sealed before the new structure was built on top. This taught each generation a lot about the practices of the past. 

Greece, Rome and Egypt all had antiquarians and people interested in historic preservation. In Greece and Rome the process tended to be much more haphazard, being mostly confined to the preservation of religiously important texts (such as the Roman Sybilline books -- which were preserved but kept secret) and the physical structure of old temples. 

Egypt had a much longer recordkeeping tradition than Greece or Rome (remember the story in Herodotus about the temple with an unbroken collection of statues of former high priests that went back 900 years!) Some Pharoahs did restorations of temples and monuments as well, but AFAIK this was usually a straight up renovation without the preservationist ethic you find farther east. We have much less understanding of how well written information was preserved: Papyrus is much less durable than the clay tablets used in Mesopotamia, so there may very well have been a huge library of historical material but we don't know about it. However it's also possible that the Egyptians didn't care enough about secular recordkeeping to preserve it.
