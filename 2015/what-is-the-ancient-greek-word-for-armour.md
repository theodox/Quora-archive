In its most general meaning Όπλον (_hoplon)_ means 'equipment' so it's probably what you want if you want to say 'armor' in the sense of a medieval knight's armor: it's the closest since it includes the whole equipage. The full set of shield, helmet, greaves, cuirass and weapons was the πανοπλία or "complete equipage", but only the wealthiest could afford the whole thing. 

Neither one is not a perfect match for our 'armor': most often _hoplon_ (particularly in the singular) would make a Greek reader think of the big round shield preferred by Greek foot soldier. Even in antiquity people mistakenly believed that _hoplon_  was the word for shield -- the proper name for that is the [ἀσπίς](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CF%83%CF%80%CE%AF%CF%82), _aspis --_ but the mistake shows that it was the key piece of equipment that defined a heavy-armed soldier in Greek terms.

This image of the Olympic Ὁπλιτόδρομος or 'fully equipped race' may not be perfectly accurate but as you can see the runners in this race wear helmets and carry shields but are otherwise... under-armored... while still being "equipped". This points out the fact that the shield was the most important part of their equipment: in the scrum-like push and shove a melee it mattered more than body armor. A soldier who threw away his shield was a _Rhipsaspides,_ a "shield thrower" -- this was the ultimate disgrace; the famous Spartan epigram was to come home [with your shield... or on it](http://www.translatum.gr/forum/index.php?topic=5293.0), since the shield was big and sturdy enough to be used as a stretcher.

The same root shows up in Όπλίτης (_hoplites)_ is the usual term for armored soldiers who were the backbone of Greek armies. Hoplites were recruited from the propertied classes who could afford the full equipment (_hoplon)_ which gave them their name, but most hoplite-class citizens could not afford a full suit of metal armor. Helmets were probably the first thing to purchase after the shield, followed by greaves (κνημίδες ) since the shield didn't cover the legs well. 

Full metal armor was comparatively rare, because it was extremely expensive: padded linen or leather were much more standard. Fashions came and went as well; the Peloponessian war showed (eg at [Sphacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sphacteria)) that lighter, more mobile forces could defeat the traditional heavy phalanx under many conditions. Interestingly, the warriors of the Bronze Age often wore more and heavier armor than their classical-era counterparts; the Bronze-age warriors specialized in single combat and had to find all-around protection, while classical-era Hoplites were trained and equipped for close-order formation fighting. This Mycenaean-era suit ( ca 1200 BC) is much more complete than most classical era warriors would have fielded.

By contrast a light armed soldier without the heavy shield would be a _peltast,_ taking his name from the light wicker shield or _pelta._ Peltasts were usually from a lower social class (or recruited outside of Greece).
