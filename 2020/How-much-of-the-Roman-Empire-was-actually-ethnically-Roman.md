It’s not possible to answer with any precision, because _Romanitas_  was such a fluid concept.

The Romans [prided themselves on that fact](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Emperor-Claudius-ban-druidism). Unlike, for example, Athens or Sparta they were good at assimilating former enemies. The idea of incorporating new people goes all the way back to Rome’s founding myths: the legendary [kidnapping of the Sabine women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rape_of_the_Sabine_Women) ends with the union of the Romans and Sabines into one community. In historic times the Romans expanded their power largely by successfully assimilating first the elites of the rest of Italy and then gradually the lower classes as well. Many famous “Romans” did not descend directly from the original inhabitants of the city: to pick a few names at random Pompey the Great was from Picenum, and his family was probably originally Oscan-speaking; Cicero and Marius were both from Arpinum — Cicero’s enemies sometimes derided him as a “foreigner” and both families were probably of Samnite origin; Ovid probably a Paelignian by birth: his hometown fought on the other side in the Social War only 50 years before he was born.

As the emperor Claudius (his Claudian ancestors were Sabines, and he was born in Gaul)[ put it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon_Tablet):

> What was the ruin of Sparta and Athens, but this: that mighty as they were in war, they spurned from them as aliens those whom they had conquered? Our founder Romulus, on the other hand, was so wise that he fought as enemies and then hailed as fellow-citizens several nations on the very same day. Strangers have reigned over us. That freedmen's sons should be intrusted with public offices is not, as many wrongly think, a sudden innovation, but was a common practice in the old commonwealth. But, it will be said, we have fought with the Senones. I suppose then that the Volsci and Aequi never stood in array against us. Our city was taken by the Gauls. Well, we also gave hostages to the Etruscans, and passed under the yoke of the Samnites. On the whole, if you review all our wars, never has one been finished in a shorter time than that with the Gauls. Thenceforth they have preserved an unbroken and loyal peace. United as they now are with us by manners, education, and intermarriage, let them bring us their gold and their wealth rather than enjoy it in isolation.

> Everything, Senators, which we now hold to be of the highest antiquity, was once new. Plebeian magistrates came after patrician; Latin magistrates after plebeian; magistrates of other Italian peoples after Latin. This practice too will establish itself, and what we are this day justifying by precedents, will be itself a precedent.

The spread of the empire and the practice of colonization muddles the waters even further. Hundreds of thousands of Roman citizens were planted around the empire as colonists, first in Italy and then overseas. However, since the most common route to citizenship was service in the _auxilia (_ non-Roman military units which served alongside the citizen-only legions) many of these “citizen” colonists won’t have been ethnic Romans. The colonies absolutely encouraged the spread of Latin language and Roman culture — but they don’t seem to have had a genetic impact comparable to their numbers. This suggests the colonists were as likely to be Romanized auxiliaries as Romans being sent overseas.

In fact, the Roman practice of assimilation runs so deep that it’s almost impossible to identify “Roman” genetics at all. The enormous population concentration in Rome itself (starting in the later Republic and culminating in the famous million-person population mark in the first century) [seems to have largely swamped “native” Roman genetic signatures](https://www.genengnews.com/news/dna-analysis-suggests-ancient-rome-represented-a-genetic-crossroads-of-europe-and-the-mediterranean/) — scientists looking for “Roman” genetic markers have had a difficult time finding a time when Rome did not resemble a kind of running average of the Mediterranean basin as a whole. This is not surprising, given that Roman self-presentation always included assimilation and in-migration as key markers of Roman tradition. The genetics of Rome — at least after the second century BC — are as complex as those of New York or Los Angeles.

To make a long story short: I’ve seen a figure of 10% used as a ballpark approximation for the “Roman” population of the Roman empire around the first century but I don’t think it’s more than guesswork and it might be too high.
