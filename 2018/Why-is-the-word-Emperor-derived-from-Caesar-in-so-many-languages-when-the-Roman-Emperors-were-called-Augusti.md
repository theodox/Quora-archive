It is indeed Caesar—but only indirectly from the famous Julius. Emperor Augustus, who really created the Roman empire as an institution, called himself _Gaius Julius Caesar,_ exactly the same name as the Julius of Rubicon and Shakespeare fame—he was that Julius’ adopted heir and his status as a Caesar was critical to his political fortunes. He rose to power starting as a teenager with little to go on except the borrowed magic of Caesar’s name; avenging Caesar’s murder was his first great campaign.

Since Rome was very uncomfortable admitting that it had become a monarchy, the new emperor maintained the pretense that he was just another Roman Senator. Rather than being addressed by title—least of all by the dreaded title of “king”—he insisted on being addressed in the proper republican fashion: by name, as “Caesar.” This charade was carried on for the first century or so of the empire, even after Augustus’ family had died out and the throne had passed to others. “Caesar” morphed into a title because it played the valuable role of meaning “king” without saying it openly.

After about 285 the official titulature envisioned a senior and a junior ruler in each half of the empire, with the seniors as _Augusti_ and the juniors as _Caesares_ . The Byzantines [retained the title “Caesar”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_(Byzantine_title)) and bestowed it on heirs apparent and foreign rulers as an honorific title: that’s how it entered Slavic languages, Turkish, Arabic and Persian. It looks like it entered German directly from Latin in the early imperial period: it may be the oldest Latin loanword in German.

_Emperor_  comes from _imperator_ , “commander” or “field marshal”—another of the titles that early Roman emperors used to disguise their autocratic power.
