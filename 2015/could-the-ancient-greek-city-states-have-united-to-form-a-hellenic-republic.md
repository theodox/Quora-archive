It's very unlikely. 

Disunity was the great curse of classical Greece -- within cities, factions fought constantly and the different cities had a very difficult time uniting for any purpose. The Persian invasion under Xerxes, for example, saw many Greek cities siding with the Persians -- some out of fear but others (particularly Thebes) in order to settle scores with their neighbors. Even within the Greek coalition there was frequent argument; Herodotus's [account of the battle of Salamis](http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Herosal.html), for example, shows Greek admirals arguing ferociously over trifles and threatening to quit the alliance -- as it played out, Themistocles had to leak Greek plans to the Persians in order to forestall a hasty retreat by ships from Corinth and the Peloponessus. 

After the Peloponessian war (430 - 400 BC), and the drag-down-the-leader politics which followed the Spartan victory, several smaller cities did form federal states to counter the power of Sparta (and Thebes, and evnetually of Macedon). The most successful of these groups were the [Achaean League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaean_League) and the [Aetolian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetolian_League), both of which were important actors in Greek politics down till the Roman conquest (but both of which still suffered from intense factional politics internally). 

 Both leagues were more effective at running large territories than any of the traditional city states -- but neither could stand alone against Macedon and the Greeks as a whole never united sufficiently to get out of the Macedonian shadow. Greece proper was never a united state and, divided into many small hostile units, was constantly subject to interference from Macedonia -- only support from outside (usually from the Ptolemies or the Seleucids) kept Greece even nominally independent. 

Fittingly the final Roman conquest in 146 was itself an offshoot of a conflict between pro- and anti-Macedonian factions in several parts of Greece, and the army. The Achaeans declared war on Rome because Rome refused to recognize their annexation of Sparta.

So... you get the picture. Some idealists did dream of a 'united Greece'. This started with an ideal of cooperation among the city states -- but the most common practical proposal was always 'Greek unity under a strong (Macedonian) king,' an ideal which most Greeks rejected.
