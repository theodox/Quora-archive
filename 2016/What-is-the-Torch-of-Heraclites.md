The one word answer is "the sun". But it's a bit more complicated....

[Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus) was a very early Ionian philosoper : one of the group known as 'pre-Socratics' -- early philosophers who tended to focus on cosmology and physics, rather than logic and ethics like Socrates and Plato. 

His work work exists only in quotations from other writers. His big idea was summed up as πάντα ῥεῖ , or "everything flows" ; the idea that the world is constantly being recreated from new sensations and appearance. He's also famous for the quote we usually recycle as 'you can't step into the same river twice'

 Like most of the other pre-Socratics he was intensely interested in finding a root principle or underlying, basic core out of which the universe was made. His explanation was that fire (this was of course long before the word 'energy' had been invented) was the basic building block of everything:

> All things can become Fire, and Fire can be converted to all things: like goods for gold and gold for goods.

Fragment 90

>  This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But it always was, is, and will be: an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out. 

> Fragment 30

Since Heraclitus believed that human minds or souls were also, essentially, 'fire' (that is to say 'energy') it was no big step for him to see 'intelligence' or 'life' in the natural world. A Roman author named [Aetius, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetius_(philosopher))writing in the second century so 800 or so years after Heraclitus quotes him as saying 'that the sun is a great intelligent torch born from the sea.' That's the origin of the phrase. 

 But since he had few words to work with -- Greek had only just begun to evolve a philosophical vocabulary -- the lines between 'sun', 'torch', 'light', 'energy' and 'being' are all pretty fuzzy and so what seems like a very primitive metaphor is more like an effort to get past the limits of an early iron-age vocabulary. The torch of Heraclitus is... __everything,__  Or at least 'the universal principle that binds everything together'.
