The _reigning_  emperor….? only if you were _very_ brave. Some emperors allowed a modicum of free speech, but most did not.

The emperor’s predecessors…?

Well, then it really depended on how the current emperor got his throne. If the current emperor’s legitimacy depended on being the rightful successor of a previous emperor, then see the previous paragraph. On the other hand if, as often happened , the current emperor had replaced the previous dynasty — in that case you could be as critical as you wanted.

The best example of this is the work of [Suetonius](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/suetonius), who wrote early in the second century. His book [Twelve Caesars](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/home.html) really only has consistently good things to say about two of them: Augustus and Vespasian. He was writing under Trajan and Hadrian (neither of whom figure in the book, which was a safe choice). Likewise [Tacitus](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/tacitus/) is quite harsh concerning Tiberius, Caligula, Nero and Claudius and later Domitian — under whom he had once worked as a civil servant.

Tacitus’s biography of his father-in-law starts off with this passage,[ which gives a good idea of the constraints an imperial-era historian had to consider](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/tacitus-agricola.asp):

> We have read that the praises [of Domitian’s critics] were made capital crimes; that not only their persons but their very books were objects of rage, and that the triumvirs were commissioned to burn in the forum those works of splendid genius. They fancied, that in that fire the voice of the Roman people, the freedom of the Senate, and the conscience of the human race were perishing; while at the same time they banished the teachers of philosophy, and exiled every noble pursuit, that nothing good might anywhere confront them. Certainly we showed a magnificent example of patience; as a former age had witnessed the extreme of liberty, so we witnessed the extreme of servitude, when the informer robbed us of the interchange of speech and hearing. We should have lost memory as well as voice, had it been as easy to forget as to keep silence.

He goes on immediately to say this about _his_ reigning emperor:

> Now at last our spirit is returning. And yet, though at the dawn of a most happy age Nerva Cæsar [=Trajan] blended things once irreconcilable,—supreme power and freedom

Which is nice but, perhaps, a bit _too_  nice.
