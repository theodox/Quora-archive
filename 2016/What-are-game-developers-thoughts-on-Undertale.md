I feel like it's the game equivalent of a really good children's book. 

 The art and music style do a wonderful job of giving the player permission to let down their shields and engage without all the cynical min-max reflexes that games usually force us to develop. It has all the virtues of a good children's book: simplicity, directness and emotional openness. And like a good children's book it makes you think -- at least a bit -- about moral issues like video game violence and agency. 

It has some of the limitations of kid lit as well: it's simplistic and not very subtle and sometimes the music gets on my nerves for repetition. As a former animator I sometimes have to suppress a big part of my hindbrain screaming for more frames: some of those blinky one-two cycles drive me nuts.

Still, overall I love it. I get a huge kick out of watching my 3 kids (15, 10, and 6) crowded around a monitor while the middle one plays and the eldest voice-acts all the characters. Papyrus is a household name in our house.
