# Why are most of my Quora answers getting no views besides my own? I only ask because I spend a lot of time writing them.

Are you sure you’re reading the view count correctly?

The stats page suggests you’ve gotten 730K views to date, which suggests you’re (a) getting more traffic than you think or (b) checking your own _really_  often, which seems unlikely.

It does seem like most of your answers cluster in high-volume topics — it is easy for an answer to disappear into the second or third page of results on topics that attract a lot of posts — those kinds of topics are tend to be dominated by people with big follower counts who semi-automatically monopolize the first page or two of results. Those topics are hard proving grounds: smaller. more obscure topics are often a good place to attract followers.
