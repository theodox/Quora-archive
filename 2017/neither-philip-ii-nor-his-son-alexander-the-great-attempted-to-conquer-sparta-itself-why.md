Philip actually did. In 338, having defeated a last, desperate alliance of the central Greek city states at [Chaeronea](https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Chaeronea), he brought his army down into the Peloponnese.

He sent his messengers to Spartans demanding their surrender in no uncertain terms:

> You are advised to submit without further delay, for if I bring my army into your land, I will destroy your farms, slay your people, and raze your city

To which the Spartans proudly replied

> _If._ 

As it happened, Philip declined to press the issue. He did invade Spartan territory in Laconia but deliberately chose not to try and take the city. Instead, he peeled off a number of territories which the Spartans had taken from their neighbors and distributed them to the other states of the Peloponnese which had voluntarily submitted to him. This not only weakened Sparta, it gave all of Sparta’s neighbors a vested interest in staying on Macedonia’s good side. and Philip had is sights on a far more tantalizing prize: Persia. But, whatever else he had planned, we can’t know: Philip was assassinated in 336.

Alexander courted the Spartans, but — for obvious reasons — they were unenthusiastic. He, in any case he had other problems when assumed the throne. He had to cow Philip’s unhappy Greek “allies” into obedience, [put down a rebellion in Thrace ](https://thesecondachilles.com/2015/08/09/the-thracian-campaign/)[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander%27s_Balkan_campaign#Thebes) and finally [destroy Thebes](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/diodorus/the-sack-of-thebes/) when it made a forlorn bid for freedom. The Spartans were aloof, but not an obvious threat. Alexander was definitely irked by their attitude: when he eventually sent the spoils of his victory at the Granicus to Delphi, the inscription was

> Alexander, son of Philip, and the Greeks (__except the Lacedaemonians__ ) dedicate these spoils, taken from the Persians who dwell in Asia

That was still in the future in his early years, however — when he had finished restoring the Macedonian power-base in Greece, he opted to ignore them in pursuit of the eastern dream.

The Spartan king, [Agis III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agis_III), was still new to the throne when Philip had first arrived (he took power on the same day Chaeronea was fought). Once Alexander was actually across the Aegean, however, Agis decided to gamble on a chance to restore Sparta’s power. In 333 he secretly contacted [Pharnabazus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharnabazus_III), the Persian satrap of Asia Minor, and offered to help cut Macedonian supply lines in the Aegean if the Persians would provide money and men.

As the plan was getting underway, however, Alexander defeated the Persians at [Issus](http://www.ancient.eu/Battle_of_Issus/), changing the equation; Agis took his men and money to try conquering Crete (which, not coincidentally, would be a valuable buffer against Alexander in Phoenicia). But it’s important not to use too much hindsight here: the key Spartan preoccupation was not with Macedonia, but with recovering the territories lost to Philip after Chaeronea. So, when Agis finally decided to make an open move (in 331) it wasn’t against Alexander, it was to seize [Megalopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Megalopolis) in the central Peloponnese — a position that was critical to Sparta’s regional position but hardly a bold stroke to cut off Alexander’s army.

This was, of course, a declaration of war on Macedonia. Agis defeated the Macedonian garrison in the Peloponnese, but the Macedonian commander-in-chief for Greece, [Antipater, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipater)quickly organized a decisive response. Given the timing it’s unlikely that the initiative came from Alexander — but given the nature of the challenge, and the shaky foundations of Greek support for Alexander’s project in Asia, it’s hard to imagine any different response. Antipater brought 40,000 troops against Agis’ 25,000. Despite a creditable showing on the field the Spartans were defeated.

True to the ancient Spartan code, Agis died on the field

> _He had fought gloriously and fell with many frontal wounds. As he was being carried by his soldiers back to Sparta, he found himself surrounded by the enemy. Despairing of his own life, he ordered the rest to make their escape with all speed and to save themselves for the service of their country, but he himself armed and rising to his knees defended himself, killed some of the enemy and was himself slain by a javelin cast. He had reigned nine years._ 

Diodorus 17.62

The League of Corinth referred the fate of the Spartans to Alexander directly — it’s not clear if this represented unwillingness of Greek states to punish Sparta for doing what they lacked the courage to do themselves, or if it was an an effort to put the blame for what many expected to be the annihilation of Sparta on someone else’s shoulders.

In any case, Alexander surprised everyone by his leniency — he levied a fine of 120 talents (a fraction of what the Spartans had gotten from Pharnabazus) and obliged them to join the League. The Spartans probably helped their case by being the first Greek state to offer him divine honors* a measure of how far they had fallen from the proud days of Thermopylae and Plataea.

It was a fitting coda to Spartan power. Sparta was never again to be a first-rank power in Greek politics. Alexander himself later said that Agis’ war was “a battle of mice”.



*The Spartans had at least the excuse that they were notably devoted to the oracle of Ammon at Siwa, well before Alexander used it to proclaim his own divinity in 332
