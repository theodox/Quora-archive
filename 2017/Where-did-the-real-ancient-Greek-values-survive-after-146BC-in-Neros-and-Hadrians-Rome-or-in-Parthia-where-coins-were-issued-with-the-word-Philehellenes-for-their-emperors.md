# Where did the real ancient Greek values survive after 146BC, in Nero's and Hadrian's Rome or in Parthia where coins were issued with the word "Philehellenes" for their emperors?

It would be an overstatement so say the Parthians were the real inheritors of Greece.

The Parthian empire — as the successors of the Seleucids in Mesopotamia and Iran — did make an effort at conciliating their Greek subjects. [Seleucia on the Tigris](http://www.livius.org/articles/place/seleucia-on-the-tigris/) was the biggest city in their empire, not quite on a par with Alexandria but — at about 400,000 people — in the same league economically as Antioch. [Susa](http://www.livius.org/articles/place/susa/), which had been rebuilt as a Greek city after Alexander’s time was also a critical part of their state: just as the Seleucids had to retain some of the Aramaic administrative apparatus of the Persians, the Parthians had to pick up some of the Greek habits of the Seleucids (in their Greek correspondence, anyway, they even kept up the [Seleucid calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_era))

Like the Persians before Alexander had done, the Parthians also made use of Greek artisans and architects. The fondness of some of the Parthian nobility for Greek culture is well illustrated by the famous story that about [Orodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orodes_II_of_Parthia) learning of the battle of Carrhae [during a performance of Euripides’ Bacchae. ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/crassus*.html)The same Orodes cemented his alliance with Artavasdes of Armenia — which would go on to trigger another Roman-Parthian war — thanks to the two Iranian kings’ shared love of Greek poetry.

Still, royal Philhellenism didn’t change the basic fact that the Parthians were an Iranian dynasty (they pretended, at least, to be descended from the royal line of Darius). The social basis of their power wasn’t the Greek cities of their realm, it was the horseback nobility of Iran and the steppes. Parthians ruled a complex, polyglot empire and their policy was devoted to keeping their subjects complacent — they were philhellenes to the Greeks, but also philosemites to the Jews, and patrons of the temples in Babylon.

The [Sassanids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire) — who overthrew the Parthians after around the year 200 — took a very different approach to empire. They were aggressive centralizers in both political and social terms. Particularly in later times they promoted their state version of Zoroastrianism and suppressed rival religions, particularly Christianity and Manichaeism. This went hand in hand with a strong emphasis on Iranian cultural traditions and styles. They were not completely isolated from Greek culture — the [Academy of Gondishapur ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Gondishapur)which they created certainly had Greek works in Pahlavi translation —but in general their approach to culture was a nationalist one centered on their own world view.
