At first, they didn’t get anything worse than snark. After Alexander’s victory at the [Granicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Granicus), he sent home 300 suits of captured Persian armor to Athens to be dedicated as trophies in the Parthenon, with the inscription

> “Alexander, son of Philip, and all the Greeks except the Lacedaemonians, present this offering from the spoils taken from the foreigners inhabiting Asia.”

([Arrian, 1.16](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/46976/46976-h/46976-h.htm#Page_47))

The Spartans were the most prominent holdouts, though few of the Greek “allies” were really enthusiastic about Alexander’s adventures and many of their contingents were pretty nominal. There’s no question that a single serious defeat would have dissolved Alexander’s “Hellenic League” overnight.

However, affairs moved beyond sarcasm after the battle of the [Issus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Issus).

[Agis III](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/agis-iii/) of Sparta was in close contact with the Persian satrap of Asia Minor, Pharnabazus. The Spartans had taken a lot of Persian gold in the 50 years before Alexander, so this is hardly surprising. However Alexander’s victory at the [Issus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Issus) left the Spartans in an embarassing position: politcally compromised but now cut off from their Persian allies. The best the Spartans could do was to spend the money they’d already gotten to hire mercenaries and mount a campaign in Crete: nominally not part of the Macedonian-Persian war though in fact, of course, it was intended to impose a buffer between Spartan interests in Greece and Alexander’s forces, bogged down in the siege of Tyre.

Meanwhile, Alexander’s viceroy in Greece, Antipater, was off fighting the Thracians. Sensing an opportunity (and knowing that time was against them) the Spartans struck at the Macedonian garrisons in the Peloponessus. But Antipater was flush with money, thanks to Alexander’s spoils, and he quickly raised an army of 40,000 — twice what the Spartans could field, even with their own Persian gold. At [Megalopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Megalopolis) in 331 the Spartans were humbled; Agis died on the battlefield along with the last vestiges of Sparta’s mythical invincibility.

Surprisingly, the Spartans were not punished with the severity which most contemporaries expected.

Some of this may reflect distrust between Alexander and Antipater. Alexander was unhappy that the defeat of the famed Spartans belonged to his lieutenant, while Antipater himself seems to have deliberately refused to take responsibility for the final dispositions as a way of keeping a lower profile. Technically the decision wasn’t even made by the Macedonians; nominally it was a collective decision by a Peloponnessian council.

Of course, in the end the final call belonged to Alexander. Alexander shared his father’s odd combination of ruthlessness and sentimentality — just as Philip had spared Athens despite flattening many lesser cities, Alexander allowed Sparta to simply moulder away rather than erasing it from the map. It may also be that Alexander regretted the harshness of his [earlier treatment of Thebes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thebes) — he never entirely lived down his reputation as the man who leveled one of Greece’s most famous cities, and didn’t want to add another black mark now that he was on track to be the man who brought down the Persian empire.

Thus, the final terms were surprisingly mild. In some sense it didn’t matter: the heavy losses at Megalopolis permanently shattered the old Spartan military regime: for the rest of Spartan history the city would be just another city state in a world dominated by vast international empires. However Sparta’s handful of allies got off equally lightly: though many prominent anti-Macedonian leaders were killed the cities themselves were treated mercifully. Tegea was basically pardoned. Elis and the nascent Achaean League were forced to pay reparations to Megalopolis.

Of course, Macedonian garrisons and Macedonian interventions in domestic politics were becoming increasingly common for Alexander’s nominal friends as well as his recent enemies all over Greece. Whatever the public pronouncements might have been, it was clear who really held the reigns of Greece. Alexander’s leniency may simply have been a recognition that that only difference between the “loyalty” of his “allies” and the emnity of enemies was was the honesty of the latter.
