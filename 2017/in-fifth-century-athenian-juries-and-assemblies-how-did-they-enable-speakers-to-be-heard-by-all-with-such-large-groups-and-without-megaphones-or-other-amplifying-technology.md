# In fifth-century Athenian juries and assemblies, how did they enable speakers to be heard by all (with such large groups, and without megaphones or other amplifying technology)?

The usual jury size was only 500, although for some trials this could be expanded to 1000. That’s a lot, but similar to the range of sizes you find in a broadway theater (many of which were designed before modern sound equipment). It’s challenging, but not impossible, to reach that kind of crowd.

Ancient orators were trained in projection — the famous orator [Demosthenes](https://princetonpublicspeaking.com/public-speaking-tips/public-speaking-expert-demosthenes-part-1/) used to practice his speeches while running, to build up his wind, and also tried to enunciate them with a mouth full of pebbles to perfect his articulation. Later [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Oratore) recommended that orators study the vocal control of actors (he also recommended not practicing speeches at full volume, which he felt was too tiring and too much of an ordeal to do often).

The _heliaia_  courts limited speeches on both sides to 3 hours each, though many surviving speeches would have taken less time to deliver if they were simple read-throughs. Aeschines’ _[Against Timarchus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0001:speech=1)_ , for example, is around 15,000 words — for most modern Americans that would be about 2 hours. It’s possible that means the ancient delivery was slower and more deliberate than ours to aid comprehension — or that it included pauses for people to repeat parts of what’s said. We know in other settings that public speaking involved both repetition and ‘relays’ to get to the entirety of the crowd, as for example when the Roman general Flamininus [proclaimed “freedom to the Greeks” at the Isthmian games ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/flamininus*.html)in 196:

> … the trumpet signalled a general silence, and the herald, coming forward into the midst of the spectators, made proclamation that the Roman senate and Titus Quintius Flamininus proconsular general, having conquered King Philip and the Macedonians, restored to freedom, without garrisons and without imposts, and to the enjoyment of their ancient laws, the Corinthians, the Locrians…[etc]… At first, then, the proclamation was by no means generally or distinctly heard, but there was a confused and tumultuous movement in the stadium of people who wondered what had been said, and asked one another questions about it, and called out to have the proclamation made again; but when silence had been restored, and the herald in tones that were louder than before and reached the ears of all, had recited the proclamation, a shout of joy arose, so incredibly loud that it reached the sea.
