Alexander seems to have pretty conventional Greek Olympian beliefs (which doesn't tell us much, since Greek religion was not very systematic or centralized). However he was himself a religious figure of some importance.

During his conquest of Egypt he courted native Egyptians by appealing to traditional Egyptian religious beliefs. He visited the [Oracle of Siwa](http://www.greece.org/alexandria/alexander/Pages/siwa.html), a famous Egyptian holy site deep in the Libyan desert, and emerged with the claim that he was the son of "Zeus Ammon" -- a hybrid of the chief Greek deity Zeus and Amun-Ra[1], the the head of the Egyptian pantheon. He ruled Egypt with the title and some of the trappings of an Egyptian Pharaoh, although he didn't stay long, as he was still warring against the Persians. The Persians -- who in most of their empire were fairly tolerant -- were extremely unpopular in Egypt and had denigrated the native religion, so Alexander's patronage gained him an enthusiastic following. After his death the [Ptolemies ](http://www.livius.org/articles/dynasty/ptolemies/)ruled Egypt with many of the same concessions to Egyptian style.

Zeus-Ammon (left) and Alexander (right). The horns over the ears are a Greek version of the traditional animal-headed deities of Egypt. Here's a more traditional representation of Amun:

Alexander caused a lot of friction among his own army by openly ruling as a 'living god'. He ordered Greek cities to put his statues in temples, and he minted coins showing himself holding the thunderbolt (traditionally, the symbol of Zeus)

_Coin of Alexander showing him holding the thunderbolt._ 

His soldiers seemed not to care what he said to the Egyptians or later the Persians but there were several incidents in which old comrades made fun of Alexander's divine status when he started to expect similar honors from Greeks and Macedonians. He [irritated his officers](http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t15.html) by demanding that they prostrate themselves before him (A Persian custom which Greeks had proudly disdained). [Callisthenes,](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Callisthenes-of-Olynthus) one of Alexander's early biographers, was executed after remarking unfavorably on the custom. 

After Alexander's death, treating emperors as living gods became a staple of Greek politics (a practice which the Romans found ridiculous during the Republic, but which eventually was applied to Roman emperors too). Alexander continued to receive worship in several of the cities he founded (notably Alexandria, in Egypt) long after his death. Some people think the figure of [Dhul-Qarnayn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn), the 'Two-horned one' who holds back Gog and Magog in the Koran, is Alexander in his Ammon-guise -- though this is highly disputed.

_[1] Alexander didn't invent the association of Zeus and Ammon -- there was apparently a statue of a Ram-horned Zeus at Delphi more than a hundred years before Alexander, and the Spartans in particular paid a lot of respect to the Oracle of Siwa._
