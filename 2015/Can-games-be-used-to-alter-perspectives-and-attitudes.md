There are two different things going on: what the game creators want to do, and what the players do with what we give them. As in any art form the relationship between them is unpredictable and complex. 

In the last decade, since game authorship became more widely accessible, there have been hundreds of didactic games trying to educate, shock, guilt-trip, recontextualize, or otherwise persuade players. These seem to work more or less like most didactic literature, with the same (slight) chance of changing opinion and the same (low) appeal to the unconverted. I haven't run in to many that strike me as anything more interesting than animated pamphlets.

On the other hand, there are plenty of games that create experiences that oblige players to think for themselves, but don't push their conclusions so ham-handedly. These can really affect players' views, although not always in ways the creators intended. 

On the sliding scale from art to propaganda, I've always felt that part of the equation is the loss of control. Whatever you wish to say, in any art form, there seems to be a tradeoff between offering the reader/viewer/player a single story that they must reject and creating a world with its own rules that they can live in as they see fit. This maps particularly well onto games but is hardly unique to them.

So: can you make a game to teach positive values? absolutely, just like you could write a book to do the same. And, just like a book, it's easy to make an argument that persuades a few and extremely difficult to create a world that changes the lives of many.
