I’m assuming you want originals, not classic modern studies of Greek history.

The Big 3, the indispensable ones, are:

__Herodotus__ , aka either “The Father of History” or “The Father of Lies” — his reptutation was a bit checkered even antiquity (“Father of Lies” was, if I recal correctly, a coinage from Manetho, a Greco-Egyptian writer who objected to Herodotus’ depiction of Egypt). First and foremost, it’s a fun read (and it’s a great bathroom book, because it’s full of nice little anecdotes and side-stories — you don’t have to digest big narratives in one long go). Herodotus’ book is as much a travelogue as it is a history of the Greco-Persian wars; as such it provides a huge wealth of detail — of widely varying quality, but usually interesting regardless — about the whole of the eastern Mediterranean world in the 5th century BC. He’s sometimes derided for being too credulous, but more than a few of his more outlandish assertions have proven to have at least some basis in fact, and he himself is often quite clear when he’s relaying second hand information that he himself doesn’t trust — a trait that seems particularly appealing in the internet era. It’s a vivid look at a vanished world and also full of interesting reflections on cultural relativity that hold up pretty well even today — we think we are ‘diverse’ but we’ve got nothing on a world where the Persian Empire alone had hundreds of languages and peoples.

If you like dead trees the [The Landmark Herodotus](http://amzn.to/29N6C3G) is a noble edition with good maps and notes; otherwise he’s available free in many places including [The Internet Classics Archive](http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.html). There’s also a good [Kindle version](http://amzn.to/2a1QYRT), it’s probably worth paying for since the free ones are often bad robo-scans of out-of-print books and full of typos.

__Thucydides__  is a very, very different writer: there Herodotus is an brilliant impressionist whose interested in people, drama and pathos Thucydides is the earliest example of a deep, systematic analyst of historical events. His book on the [Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War) is certainly stuffed with detail about a variety of long-forgotten battles and coups, but it’s fundamentally a dark and very clear-eyed investigation into the logic of conflict and the workings of power. His discussions of the run-up to the war, the machiavellian maneuverings between Sparta, Athens and the lesser powers, the terrible Athenian debacle in Syracuse and awful plague which devastated Athens are all somber and all brilliant. If you’re at all interested in Great Power psychology and the nature of political violence, it’s a must read.

There’s a [Landmark Thucydides](https://www.amazon.com/Landmark-Thucydides-Comprehensive-Guide-Peloponnesian/dp/0684827905/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468800263&sr=8-1&keywords=thucydides) which, like the Herodotus, includes maps and good notes. I have not read [this abridgement](http://amzn.to/2a2dObO) myself but I hear it’s good and it cuts out a lot the extraneous details of obscure hoplite battles. The whole thing also available [online](http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.html).

_Of the three portraits this is the only one we’re sure is contemporary: Polybius as a young cavalry officer before he ended up in Rome as a hostage — and found himself an eyewitness to Rome’s most important decade._ 

__Polybius__  is actually the most influential of the three: his history of the rise of Rome was practically gospel to enlightenment political theorists. His depiction of the Roman Republic at its peak inspired Locke, Rousseau, and Jefferson’s efforts to find a synthesis of freedom and responsibility, of liberty and law. It’s also a good read if you like derring do, since it covers the great wars between Rome and Carthage, from Hannibal’s elephants crossing the Alps to the final destruction of Rome’s arch-nemesis. It’s also worth a close read because you can observe [the tragic degradation of the Roman character](https://www.quora.com/What-were-popular-Greek-opinions-of-Rome-especially-before-the-Second-Punic-War-and-Rome’s-ascension-to-supwerpower-status) in a world without rivals, culminating in the brutal sack of Corinth and the end of Greek independence — as seen through the eyes of a Greek patriot but also a Romanophile. Polybius is not as amusing as Herodotus or as insightful as Thucydides, but he is an eye-witness to some of the most important years of antiquity and a well informed, experienced observer who knew how politics and power interacted.

There’s no nice, hardbound edition of Polybius but there are plenty of decent [paperback translations](http://amzn.to/29FlLmm). An online version is [here](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/home.html). He’s crying out for a good abridgment which focuses on his influential political theories but I’m not aware of one off the top of my head.
