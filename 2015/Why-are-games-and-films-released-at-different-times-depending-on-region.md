For games, at least, there are multiple considerations:



__Localization__  takes a long time. There are thousands - or tens of thousands - of UI elements to be translated and rechecked. This typically takes months, and can't begin until the game is basically done (since nobody wants to pay for translating lines that get cut before ship). 

__Legal issues__  vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction -- a game has to be completed and submitted in localized form to local ratings agencies. These can vary a lot in terms of responsiveness -- for example I worked on a game that was submitted to the South African ratings agency who then lost the paperwork and never rated the game (without telling us, of course). We were lucky enough to have an active fan in South Africa who called the raters and figured out what was happening -- but without that we could have waited months more. Raters often try to get changes in the game (or game companies want to make small changes to get a more favorable rating) which also takes a lot of time.

__Markets__  vary a lot from region to region. Nowadays the 'Christmas season' is a significant selling factor in about two thirds of the world, but there are lots of local holidays in different regions which you want to target or avoid. For example, you probably don't want to come out in early August in Europe, when lots of people are traveling.
