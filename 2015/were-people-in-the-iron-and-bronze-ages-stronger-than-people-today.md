Which people?

Before the 18th century, in most societies average people were not very well nourished. In agricultural societies, access to protein was pretty limited -- if you were a peasant (like most people) you probably lived on a protein-poor, carb rich diet. That probably left you pretty short and hampered muscle development, so even though you lived a pretty strenuous life full of exercise you were probably not stronger in absolute terms than modern people. The average iron age man from Greece, for example, was about 167cm or 5'4", as compared to 176/5'9" in the US today. I don't have any numbers for the Bronze age but I assume they'd be lower, since agricultural productivity translated into more food for everybody. The lack of protein is why [paleo dieters](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-paleo-diet-half-baked-how-hunter-gatherer-really-eat/) and nostalgic fans of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle idolize the pre-agricultural past, since it offers lots of lots muscle-building foods and exercise. Of course, if you were nearsighted, clumsy or just not very athletic you didn't live very long, so being all three I'm a happy post-neolithic specimen.

If you were lucky enough to be born an a Bronze or Iron-age aristocrat, with plenty of food and in particular lots of meat and fish, you could easily end up at 6' or more -- the "heroic six footer" was kind of a trope standard character in Greek poetry and drama. Most ancient people were in good shape by our standards, since they had to do so much more manual work and walked everywhere; professional athletes and warriors had plenty of opportunities for practice and some of them were pretty muscular if statuary is any guide. Not just in Greece - the Assyrians, for example, clearly admired musculature too:

Interestingly the Spartans seem to have been taller than their neighbors, in spite of a diet that contemporaries thought of as, well, spartan: [The Physical Appearance of Spartans](http://spartareconsidered.blogspot.com/2011/09/physical-appearance-of-spartans.html). 

For a not entirely reliable, but interesting look at how a classical strong-man lived, read up on [Milo of Croton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_of_Croton), who reputedly ate 20 pounds of meat a day.

In summary, I'd suggest that pretty much everyone 3,000 years ago got a lot of exercise by modern standards but only a small minority had the diet and opportunities for specialized training we have today. I'd assume that a modern NFL linebacker would be the strongest, fastest, tallest and heaviest man on any bronze-age battlefield.
