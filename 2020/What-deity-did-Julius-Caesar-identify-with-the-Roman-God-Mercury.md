It’s… complicated.

Caesar will have been familiar with the several “equations” of Roman Mercury with gods from other cultures. The business of finding somewhat analogous deities in other societies’ pantheons was a basic aspect of cultural exchange in antiquity.

Obviously, like any educated Roman, Caesar will have known the identification of Mercury with the Greek __Hermes__ . The early history of that connection is pretty murky so we don’t really know how close the analogy between the two gods was when the early Romans first encountered Greek religious ideas in the seventh century BC or thereabout. However by Caesar’s day it was a well established and uncontroversial one, Caesar’s _Mercurius_  will have worn Mercury’s winged hat and sandals, carried the caduceus staff, and run errands for Jupiter/Zeus.

The Etruscan “version” — that is to day the Etruscan deity which Greeks and Romans tended to equate with Mercury and Hermes — was __[Turms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turms)__ __.__ 

Caesar would probably have been familiar with the identification of Hermes (thus, of Mercury) with the Egyptian __Thoth__ . That one was definitely common in Ptolemaic Egypt, and Caesar’s contemporary Cicero was aware of it among other more obscure variants:

> One Mercury has the Sky for father and the Day for mother; he is represented in a state of sexual excitation traditionally said to be due to passion inspired by the sight of Proserpine. Another is the son of Valens and Phoronis; this is the subterranean Mercury identified with Trophonius. The third, the son of the third Jove and of Maia, _[note: the conventional Olympian version]_ ____ the legends make the father of Pan by Penelope. The fourth has Nile for father; the Egyptians deem it sinful to pronounce his name. The fifth, worshipped by the people of Pheneus, is said to have killed argus and consequently to have fled in exile to Egypt, where he gave the Egyptians their laws and letters. His Egyptian name is Theuth, which is also the name in the Egyptian calendar for the first month of year.

[De Natura Deorum, 56](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Natura_Deorum/3A*.html)

The Hermes-Thoth association had not yet completely blossomed into the root of the [hermetic tradition](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hermetic-writings#ref1198). However Greek Hermes’ reputation for cleverness was at least a plausible match for Thoth’s reputation as the inventor of many useful arts like writing and mathematics.

As you can probably glean from that Cicero quote, ancient theology was the opposite of systematic. It was the collation of many unrelated local traditions, grouped together with varying degrees of logic based on all sorts of potential correspondences — individual pairings might make sense but they tended to accumulate in contradictory ways over time. This was such a common phenomenon in antiquity that it’s unlikely it would have struck Caesar as strange in any way.

When campaigning in Gaul, Caesar himself said the Gaul’s worshipped “Mercurius”:

> They worship as their divinity, Mercury in particular, and have many images of him, and regard him as the inventor of all arts, they consider him the guide of their journeys and marches, and believe him to have great influence over the acquisition of gain and mercantile transactions. Next to him they worship Apollo, and Mars, and Jupiter, and Minerva; respecting these deities they have for the most part the same belief as other nations: that Apollo averts diseases, that Minerva imparts the invention of manufactures, that Jupiter possesses the sovereignty of the heavenly powers; that Mars presides over wars

[De Bello Gallico, 17](http://classics.mit.edu/Caesar/gallic.6.6.html)

He presumably meant __[Lugus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugus)__ __,__ a Gallic deity cognate with the more famous Irish-Celtic [Lugh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugh) and the Welsh [Lleu Llaw Gyffes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lleu_Llaw_Gyffes) It’s not clear if Caesar invented that identity himself but it’s completely in line with predictable Greco-Roman ethnography. It’s quite possible however that Greeks from Massilia had already established the correspondence between their Hermes and the Lugus of their neighbors and Caesar merely added another step in the equation.

Lugus did not follow Mercury/Hermes’ role as a messenger of the gods; he was more like Hermes/Thoth a patron of cleverness and invention. It’s far from impossible that whoever established analogy between Lugus and Mercury was actually thinking of the Hermes/Thoth the patron of invention rather than Hermes the messenger of Zeus. It’s suggestive that Lugus is often depicted as having three faces: Hermes “thrice greatest” was associated with threes.



Gallic Lugus, incidentally, clearly influenced German tribes on the other side of the Rhine: They must have identified him with a deity of their own which is why Tacitus (a century after Caesar) will identify Germanic __[Wuotan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin)__ ____ (that is, Odin) with Mercury rather than Jupiter — emphasizing Wuotan’s role as a seer and a wizard rather than his nominal “kingship” of the pantheon. That’s way our _Wednesday,_ that is _Wodensday_ , is Romance languages is some variant on _dies Mercurii_ , such as _Mercredi_  in French and _Mercoledi_  in Italian.
