I'll skip over the "discovered" part (if you've been on the internet for any length of time, you'll be able to predict how that one goes pretty easily). And for _black people_  I'll assume you mean sub-saharan Africans; the "race" of the eminently well documented Egyptians is [a Quora perennial.](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-West-reject-the-writings-of-ancient-Greeks-and-Hebrews-about-the-Egyptians)

As for "when, and how much do sub-Saharan African's show up in Greek and Roman records?":

__Early contacts__ 

There were some contacts from the very earliest periods. For example a few people we'd assume are 'black' show up in Mycenean Greek and Cretan art, between say 1300 and 1200 BC:

This was all mediated through Egypt. Greeks traded with Egypt and the Middle East from early on, and they will certainly have seen people there from Nubia (modern Sudan) and beyond. Egypt had been conquered from the south a couple of times by that point, and the Egyptians always frequently hired the [Medjay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medjay) and other peoples from the upper Nile as mercenaries (for a long time they formed the main Egyptian police force).

However this contact with Africa was primarily with the Nile valley. The camel was not widely domesticated in the Mediterranean region until around the 1st century, so crossing the Sahara was extremely difficult: many Greek and Roman geographers believed that the area we'd call the equator was uninhabitable. There was evidence to the contrary: the Greek historian Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BC, [records a story](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/herodotus/herodotus-on-the-first-circumnavigation-of-africa/) about an Egyptian pharaoh hiring a Phoenician crew to sail around Africa, a feat they supposedly accomplished in a three year journey around what we'd call 600 BC, returning via the straights of Gibraltar.

However the voyage (if historical) was difficult, and economically not very viable. Long distance trade in ancient times was extremely dangerous and expensive; to justify the expense you needed to convey things which were very valuable for their size and weight: spices, silk, precious metals and jewels dominated the long distance trade and nobody seemed to expect to find those farther south.

So, this did not become a regular trade, or at least not one that was well recorded. There are some theories that the [Land of Punt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Punt), which the Egyptians regarded as an exotic but profitable trade destination, was far down the African coast - but the majority view is that it was somewhere on the Red Sea. However neither route was a regular trade: by the same time the Greeks were meeting the Egyptians for the first time, "Punt" was so rarely visited that it had become more or less a legend in Egypt.



Between Homer (about 800 BC) and historic times dim knowledge of the lands beyond the Nile did filter north, but because it was so indirect -- and because this was a long time before photography -- it tended to be distorted into legend. The early Greeks were vaguely aware of people they called Αἰθίοπες, “Aethiops”, literally "burnt-faces" -- the origin of our world _Ethiopia._ Homer (around 800 BC) includes an AEthiopian king, [Memnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memnon_(mythology)), among the heroes who defended Troy:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6c47d7ea238108a96c276462df3ff6b2-c)

A thousand years after Homer the Greek writer [Philostratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philostratus) describes a famous painting of Memnon which from his own day:

> Memnon coming from AEthiopia slays Antilochus who had thrown himself in front of this father, and he seems to strike terror among the Achaeans – for before Memnon’s time black men were but a subject for story... Memnon, stands, terrible to look upon, in the army of the AEthiopians, holding a spear and wearing a lion’s skin and sneering at Achilles.

Philostratus remark is interesting because it implies (on what basis we can't be sure) that the Greeks had a tradition of an early encounter with black people -- however we don't have an actual record of what that might be. Homer provides no details of his appearance at all -- but by the Hellenistic period he is conventionally depicted as an African, and the (lost) post-Homeric work which detailed his fight with Achilles was known as the _Aethiopis._ 

The Greeks did eventually meet African warriors in a historical context. The Persian' invasion of Greece in 480 BC was a vast, multicultural array of all the parts of Persian empire -- which included Egypt. The Egyptian contingent included "Ethiopians" -- probably from the allied [Kingdom of Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush). Herodotus describes them like this:

> The Ethiopians were wrapped in skins of leopards and lions, and carried bows made of palmwood strips, no less than four cubits long, and short arrows pointed not with iron but with a sharpened stone that they use to carve seals; furthermore, they had spears pointed with a gazelle's horn sharpened like a lance, and also studded clubs.

This description is probably the original basis for the depiction in Philostratus above.

Real contacts, though, were fairly few. Poor communications and the lack of intense trade made it easy for rumors and traveller's tales to spread. Homer also recorded the war between [Pygmies and Cranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmy_(Greek_mythology)), an exotic scene which was a popular motif in later art:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3bda21645689e1b44f38597bc7df17f9)

This is probably a distorted version of actual ostrich hunting by bush peoples in central Africa. However other tales included things like ants collecting gold, people with no heads, and people whose feet were so large they could lie on their backs and use them as sun-shades in the tropical heat! So — use with caution.



__Hellenistic period__ 

After Alexander the Great conquered Egypt (332 BC) Greeks were in more direct contact with Egypt's traditional trading partners and rivals in the Nile valley. The Greek rulers of Egypt [desperately needed elephants](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-historical-fact-you-know-off-the-top-of-your-head/answer/Steve-Theodore?srid=zLvM&share=3532e59f) for their armies and began a vast, expensive project to capture and domesticate African elephants. However they found these only as far south as [Cape Elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Guardafui) (Cape Gardafui) in modern Somalia.

On rare occasions, Greeks ventured farther south than that. The furthest southern point in the known Greek world was known as [Rhapta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhapta); it has never been clearly identified, but it’s probably in modern Tanzania. The Greeks never got much farther than that — Greek geographers thought that the coast of Aftrica turned to the west somewhere below Rhapta and eventually joined up with Asia. The Roman-era geographer Claudius Ptolemy has In the third century AD the Greek writer [Eusebius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusebius) suggested that "AEthiopia" had been settled by immigrants from the Indus valley -- which may reflect cross-ocean connections we don't otherwise have records of, or may just be a wild guess based on skin color. The Greeks did not have a very elaborate 'racial' vocabulary: _Aethiopia_  sometimes means East Africa, sometimes all of sub-Saharan Africa, but it is sometimes used for parts of India as well.

Large scale contact was not a regular feature of the Greek relationship with Africa: but there was some regular interchange of goods and peoples. For example there's this excellent portrait:

And this, which is believed to be a portrait of another Memnon -- [an "Ethiopian" pupil of the philosopher Herodes Atticus](http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/post/67369201431/ancient-art-week-memnon-portrait-roman).

__Roman Period__ 

The Romans conquered the Greek world, including Egypt, between about 250 and 45 BC. They inherited Greek contacts with the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, and hugely expanded the trade with India though they gave up on the elephant industry.

They also absorbed the North African empire of Carthage, which extended along the Mediterranean shore from Libya to Morocco and inland as far as the Atlas mountains. The Carthaginians had traded as far south along the west coast of Africa as far as modern Senegal on a fairly regular basis, (Herodotus records a voyage by the Carthaginian [Hanno the Navigator,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanno_the_Navigator) who we think travelled as far south as modern Cameroon).

However, as in East Africa, the rewards of the trip did not outweigh the risks and so voyages down the coast were infrequent. Writing in the second century the Roman natural historian Pliny [includes a long list of peoples](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=PerseusLatinTexts&getid=1&query=Plin.%20Nat.%205.8) in the southern Sahara and West Africa -- but it's a mix of accurate contemporary observation and fables dating back as far as Homer, which shows how little contact in the west had expanded in 800 years: mixed in with a reasonable account of [Garamantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamantes) of the Sahel is a reference to "the Blemmyes, who have no heads".

A little systematic exploration was done: king [Juba II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II) of Mauretania (a friend of Julius Caesar, and a well-known writer in writer in Greek though ethnically of Libyan or Berber descent) sent an expedition which seems to be the outside contact with the [Canary Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands).

The Romans had a taste for the exotic, which they indulged in a variety of ways: particularly in the Colosseum. They imported both animals and people from as far away as they could manage:

_A multicultural display in the arena: note the Africans in the 3rd row, along with leopards._ 



__TLDR__ : There was intermittent contact between the Greek and Roman world and parts of Africa throughout antiquity, though it was very heavily dominated by the people of the Nile Valley and, to a lesser degree by the Horn of Africa.

Black people were always known, but they generally remained 'exotic' in the eyes of the Greeks and Romans. It was an ethnocentric world for sure, but not a literally racist one: as the Greek common poet Menander (3rd c BC) put it while mocking people obsessed with their pedigrees:

_The man whose natural bent is good,_ 

_though his mother be an Aethiop, is nobly born._ 

Among the stereotypes that were common were both negative and positive ones: "AEthiopians" were said to be warlike and unsophisticated -- but also dignified and disdainful of wealth. As Herodotus wrote,

_"Where the south declines towards the setting sun lies the country called Aethiopia, the last inhabited land in that direction. There gold is obtained in great plenty, huge elephants abound, with wild trees of all sorts, and ebony ; and the men are taller, handsomer, and longer lived than anywhere else."_
