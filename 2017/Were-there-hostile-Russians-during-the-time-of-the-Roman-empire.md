No Russians at all, at least insofar as the historical foundation of the modern Russian state is usually said to start with the [Kievan Rus' ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan_Rus%27)in the 9th century.

On the other hand the East Roman Empire, aka, the Byzantine Empire, had long and complicated relations with the Rus and later with Russia. Rus warriors raided Byzantine territory and even attacked Constantinople itself (in 941). On the other hand they Byzantines prized Rus warriors; the [Varangian Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varangian_Guard) were one of the most elite units in the Byzantine army, and formed the primary household troops of many emperors.

Rus were not really “Russians” — to modern eyes they would look more like “vikings” — but modern Russia owes its nature to the combination of the Rus states with the Slavic peoples of the region and also the people of the Steppes. The relationship between the Rus lands and Byzantium tended to deepen over time, especially after the area adopted Orthodox Christianity. In 1472, a[ Byzantine princess married Ivan III of Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Palaiologina) — so Ivan the Terrible’s grandmother was actually a member of the Roman Imperial family.
