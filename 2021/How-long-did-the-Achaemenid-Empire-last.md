The empire proper — not just the Achaemenid dynasty, which goes back at least a couple of generations earlier — begins with the defeat of the Medes in 550 BC (as recorded in the Bablyonian [Nabonidus Chronicle](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/mesopotamian-chronicles-content/abc-7-nabonidus-chronicle/)) and ends with the death of Darius III in 330 BC.

So: __220 years__ .

If you choose to count the Persian general [Bessus](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/artaxerxes-v-bessus/), who murdered [Darius III ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_III)and briefly claimed to rule as Artaxerxes V, you can add another year. Bessus held out in Bactria until the end of spring, 329.
