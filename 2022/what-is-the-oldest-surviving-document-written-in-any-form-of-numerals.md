A lot depends on how you define “numerals”.

Tally marks go way back, at least 20,000 years:

We’re not quite sure what a Neolithic hunter-gatherer was counting, though, since tallies like this predate the emergence of both settled agriculture and the domestication of animals by as much as ten thousand years.

When agriculture and pastoralism did emerge — in the “fertile crescent” of Mesopotamia and the Near East — efforts to count and manage inventories followed soon after. Long before the emergence of writing these early farming communities used physical tokens to account for animals and produce. The earliest examples go back to about 9000 BC. Over the next couple of millennia these evolved from simple tallies to a more complex system in which different shapes indicated different amounts and different quantities:

For transactions, these tokens would be collected and pressed into a clay “envelope” in the form of a ball — this acted like the seal on an envelope. But since the only way to inspect the contents would be to break the envelope, it became common to press the tokens into the outside of the envelope before sealing it, leaving marks.

As villages gradually turned into towns and the transactions became more and more complex, the imprints of these tokens became standins for the tokens themselves. They began to denote numerical, rather than physical quantities. That ball-envelope above was already pretty old fashioned when it was created: not long after you’ll find clearly numerical texts like this, from around 3200 BC. You can see that imprints of spheres now mean 10s and imprints of cones now mean units:

The numerical system here is quite simple, with nothing but tens and ones. However the transition from collections of tallies to “documents” with numbers and accompanying pictographs kicked off a revolution: between about 3400 and 3100 BC, pictorial accounting of the kind shown above evolved into a true writing system capable of expressing abstract thought.

Along with that came the need to express quantities succinctly. The old imprints were rationalized into a more or less predictable system featuring symbols for 1, 10, 60, and 600 units (sometimes, there were special symbols for 120 and 1200 as well). The choice of 60 as a higher base was particularly clever, since it allows for integer division into____ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, or 30 parts (by contrast, 10 is only divisible by 2 and 5). This example is a bit later (27th century BC) but it’s basically the worlds oldest multiplication table:

_The middle five rows record the area of fields based on linear measures of its sides. Numbers in the first column are 1,2,3,4,5; the second column is 60, 120, 180, 240, 300. The third column uses a different notation for area units: the large dots are 180, the smaller dots 18, and the cones are sixes. However the results check out: 3x18 + 6 = 60, 180 + 3x18 + 6 = 240, 3x180 =540, 5×180 + 3x18 + 6 = 960. The very large dot in the last answer is 1080; adding 2x180 + 3x18 + 6 gives a total of 1500 units.
