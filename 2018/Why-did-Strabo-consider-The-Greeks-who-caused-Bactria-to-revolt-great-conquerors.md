He’s discussing the history of the [Greco-Bactrian Kingdom ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom)and the [Indo-Greek Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek_Kingdom), which did in fact have a pretty successful run in the two centuries before the common era. The ‘revolt’ in question was the revolt of the local governor and garrisons against the [Seleucid Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire), the easternmost of the kingdoms which emerged from the wreckage of Alexander the Great’s empire.

The land area of conquered by Bactrians and their Indo-Greek successors was comparable to the vast Seleucid territories, and it contained the wealthy Indus valley — a region that the Greeks regarded as particularly desirable. Our sources for this period are pretty scarce, so treat the maps above as an approximation rather than a well-established fact. But it they do give a good idea of how successful the eastern Greeks were during their heyday.

The coin was issued by_ _[Agathocles of Bactria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agathocles_of_Bactria)_ _but commemorates_ _[Demetrius I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_I_of_Bactria)_ _, who first extended the Bactrian kingdom into the Indus valley.

Strabo likewise wrote that [Menander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menander_I), who ruled from Sagala (=Sialkot) “conquered more tribes than Alexander.” ([11.11](http:// 	if (!IsLocallyControlled() && HasAuthority() && IsPlayerControlled()) 	{ 		ClientUpdateControllerDirection(NextFlashlightOrientation); 	})). Despite his warlike reputation , however, Menander achieved a certain immortality as a saintly character in the Buddhist [Milinda Panha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milinda_Panha).
