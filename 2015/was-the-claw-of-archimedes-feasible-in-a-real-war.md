The idea was not to lift the ship out of the water, but merely to capsize or upset it. This was made easier by the fact that Romans were using [Sambucas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambuca_%28siege_engine%29): ships equipped with scaling ladders and siege towers that had to be stationary and right up against the wall ( see [Polybius VIII 5](http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Siege/Polybius.html)). Conventional artillery and arrows were still used for harassing fire (along with, perhaps, a [burning mirror](http://www.unmuseum.org/burning_mirror.htm)) the crane was only for the very special case of dealing with a siege ship trying to put infantry onto the seaward walls.

Since the goal of the defenders was to prevent the Romans scaling the wall -- not simply to sink the ships -- the crane made perfect sense. The same account in Polybius mentions that the obvious alternative - dropping very heavy rocks on the stationary ships -- was also done.

BTW [Modern reconstructions ](http://www.triremeolympias.com/design.html)of triremes suggest a displacement of about 70 tons, which makes the claw's job even harder. However, if you're only tipping a top-heavy ship with a forecastle this isn't impossible. And FWIW, if you assume that kind close range then the mirror story seems more plausible as well: [2.009 Death Ray with Mythbusters](http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/experiments/deathray/10_Mythbusters.html)
