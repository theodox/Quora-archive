There are way more than 3; traditionally the number of Delphic maxims is about 150. The [most complete list](http://michaelchaffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/147-Delphic-maxims.pdf) contains 147.

The 3 that were carved in the most prominent spots in Delphi were: “Know thyself,” “Nothing to excess,” and the less ringing “A pledge comes from madness”

The first two are pretty easy (by Delphic standard anyway: they are like koans, intended to be pondered and not to solve a question neatly by pronouncement). Temperance — the idea of taking nothing too far, is a central theme of most Greek thought (probably because the Greeks had a real talent for taking things too far). Self-knowledge is intimately connected with two different ideas: first, a wary appreciation of ones own limitations (as an individual and as a mortal); secondly, as Plato points out in his dialog _[Charmides](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/charmides.html)_ _,_ because self-knowledge is a pre-requisite of balance and self control.

The third one is trickier for modern readers; the Greek is Ἐγγύα πάρα δ᾽ ἄτη, literally “Making a legally binding promise comes from madness”; you could read that prosaically as “Don’t co-sign a loan for a stranger” or more figuratively “don’t over-commit yourself.” In that latter context it reinforces the ideal of balance and the [golden mean.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy)) It’s very Greek either way.

The ‘short list’ of important Delphic sayings is often put at seven, associated with the semi-legendary “[Seven Sages of Greece](http://www.livius.org/articles/people/seven-sages/)“.

[Solon of Athens](http://www.hellenicaworld.com/Greece/Person/en/Solon.html) - "Nothing to excess"

[Chilon of Sparta](http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/ChilonOfSparta.html) - "Know thyself"

[Thales of Miletus](http://www.hellenicaworld.com/Greece/Person/en/Thales.html) - "A pledge comes from madness"

[Bias of Priene](http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/BiasOfPriene.html) - "Most men are bad"

[Cleobulus of Lindos](http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/Cleobulus.html) - "Moderation is the chief good"

[Pittacus of Mitylene](http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/PittacusOfMytilene.html) - "Know thine opportunity"

[Periander of Corinth](http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Live/Writer/Periander.htm) - "Forethought in all things"
