It was basically a kind of “daily” government bulletin, publishing new regulations, appointments, and official information (daily in quotes, because the Roman calendar was chock-full of _dies nefasti_ , “no-good-days” when the business of government was suspended).

Unfortunately we don’t have any copies of the _acta,_ although there are short quotations in some ancient authors. Roughly the contents would be:

__Statistics:__ The number of births and deaths in the city, payments to and from the treasury, and the status of the grain supply.

__Public records__  : New regulations, results of trials, with the names of those who were acquitted and condemned, and (in election times) the names of candidates and winners

__Senatorial decrees__ 

__Military news__ 

__Announcements:__ Upcoming festivals, games, or holidays

__Omens & Prodigies:__ Significant omens, from the birth of a two-headed animal to lightning striking a temple or other potentially ominous events.

You can get a sense from the [parody in Petronius’ Satyricon](http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/petro/satyr/sat09.htm#LIII), where the nouveaux-riche Trimalchio has his personal _acta_  read out by his secretary:

> Seventh of Kalends of July: On the manor of Cumae, Trimalchio's property, were born this day thirty boys, forty girls; were carried from threshing-floor to granary 500,000 bushels of wheat; were put to the yoke 500 oxen.

> Same day: Mithridates, a slave, was crucified for blaspheming our master Gaius' tutelary genius.

> Same day: returned to treasury ten million sesterces, no investment being forthcoming for the sum.

> Same day: a fire occurred in Pompey's garden, originating at the house of Nasta, the Bailiff."

> ….

> Next were read his Ediles' edicts and Foresters' wills, in which Trimalchio was excluded from inheritance, but mentioned with the highest encomiums. Then the names of his Bailiffs were recited; how the Chief Inspector had repudiated his mistress, a freedwoman, having detected her in an intrigue with the Bath-Super-intendent; how the Chamberlain had been removed to Baiae: the Steward convicted of peculation; and a dispute between the Grooms of the Chamber adjudicated upon.
