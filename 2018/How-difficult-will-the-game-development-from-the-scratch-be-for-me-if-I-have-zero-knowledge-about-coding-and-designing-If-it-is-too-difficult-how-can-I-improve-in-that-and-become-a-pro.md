# How difficult will the game development from the scratch be for me if I have zero knowledge about coding and designing? If it is too difficult, how can I improve in that and become a pro?

There are two different dimensions here: the starting your _career_  from scratch and starting _a project_  from scratch. They’re related but different. I’m going to concentrate on the first.

Nowadays, it’s extremely rare for people to make successful solo games. It’s not unheard of — but the general level of expectations is so high that being able to make a game solo requires talents in several unrelated areas — everything from game design to art to music — each of which is complex enough to be a career in its own right. So if you want to make a career in games you should investigate the different specialties in the industry and see which one(s) are right for you. Broadly speaking the main disciplines of game development are

__Game design__  — Deciding what the game is about and how it plays. This covers everything from story to game mechanics to detailed management of things like armor, health and economic numbers.

__Art and Effects__ — The visual content of the game, whether that’s 2-d or 3-d, static or animated. There’s also UI, maps, an marketing art too.

__Music and Sound__ — Besides theme music there are also numerous sound effects and environmental noises. Some sound people are traditional composers and musicians, others are more like audio-programmers.

__Programming__ — Games are one of the more demanding kinds of programming, since they usually have to run fast and make efficient use of memory and graphics resources. Most games are written in C++ (rather than more common business languages like Java) and demand a good knowledge of how hardware as well as software works.

__QA / Testing__ — Often overlooked, but very important: the hard job of helping to spot problems in a game and figure out exactly what is triggering them so that programmers, designers, artists and audio people can fix them. The stereotype is “playing games all day” but the reality is more like being a detective (often, a detective in a city where you don’t speak the native language well!)

Each of these big groups has a number of specialties: animators are not usually interchangeable with character artists, gameplay programmers have different skills than the ones who create AIs, and so on.

As you can imagine, with room for so much specialization it’s extremely hard to be good at all of these jobs. “Games” is such a big mature field now that “making games” is like “making houses” — there are not many people who can be both architects and plumbers (or electricians, or carpenters, or roofers...)

If you’re thinking about games as a career, there are enough educational resources nowadays that it’s actually harder to know where to start than to find information, but [Gamasutra’s career guide](http://www.gamecareerguide.com/digital_counselor/) is a decent place to begin looking for information, and there are a lot of communities of self-taught independent game developers — you might want to see if there is a chapter of the [IGDA ](http://IGDA.org)(the game developer’s association) near you and try one of their meetups.

There are also [game development schools](https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/game-design), which will give you training and a degree (either a traditional BA or a vocational certificate). Generally, though, [you want to do some real investigation into the field before you sign up for one of the schools](https://www.quora.com/Is-college-a-must-need-to-become-a-game-developer): these places are generally very expensive — as expensive as a traditional college degree. Only a small subset of these schools actually have good records placing candidates with jobs after graduation. A game dev program at your local community college, or as an add on to your regular degree, can be a great way to get familiar with the tech and the industry but the odds are that it is not a good investment. If you decide to go to a game school do a _lot_  of research on how competitive the school is and how good it’s connections to actual industry are before taking on tens of thousands of dollars in debt to attend.

The fact that an entry-level education for game development is on the same scale of effort as a traditional college degree might be a good way of thinking about your initial question. _That’s_ how hard it is to get started.



Returning to where I started, the other question is “how hard is it to make a game from scratch” — that is, without using the various free or commercial game-making tools that are out there ([Unity](https://unity3d.com/), the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4), and so on).

Generally I don’t think this is a feasible idea for somebody without prior experience. It’s only barely achievable for people who already have professional experience in games (more about why this is not a great idea [here](https://www.quora.com/I-am-a-young-independent-programmer-I-strongly-want-to-be-a-game-developer-but-I-hate-using-engines-like-Unreal-What-can-I-do)). If you’re thinking of it as a hobby learning project it can be a lot of fun (over several thousand hours of hard work). If you’re thinking of it as an actual money-making proposition — don’t do it.
