Legally yes: the power of Roman owner of his slaves was theoretically absolute for most of the Roman period.

By the second century there were some legal prohibitions on wanton cruelty. While it remained legal to kill your own slave for disciplinary reasons — say, if he were caught stealing — to do so for (legally vague) “bad reasons” was treated as murder after a law of [Antoninus Pius](http://www.roman-empire.net/highpoint/antoninus.html) (~ 150 AD) . The same emperor ruled that a magistrate could force an owner to sell a slave to a nicer master in cases of persistent abuse. After the fifth century, the Christian emperors progressively limited the rights of slave-owners over slaves, particularly their use for forced sex which up until that time was entirely routine. They also abolished the right of masters to kill altogether.

However, the limited power of the state to police behavior out of the public eye meant that there was only so much that could be done. It was particularly difficult to prosecute a slave-owner for bad behavior because slaves could not bring lawsuits on their own behalf and[ their testimony in court was only legal under torture](https://www.quora.com/Why-were-testimonies-by-slaves-in-ancient-Greece-Rome-only-valid-if-extracted-by-torture).

So, the main practical restraint on slave-owner’s behavior was social, not legal. These quotes are both from the second century, a comparatively humane period (though the Cato in the first quote lived in the 2d century BC, a period when Italy was glutted with slaves and their treatment was notably harsher than other times).

> …I regard [[Cato the Elder’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Elder)] treatment of his slaves like beasts of burden, using them to the uttermost, and then, when they were old, driving them off and selling them, as the mark of a very mean nature, which recognizes no tie between man and man but that of necessity. We know that kindness has a wider scope than justice. Law and justice we naturally apply to men alone; but when it comes to beneficence and charity, these often flow in streams from the gentle heart, like water from a copious spring, even down to dumb beasts. A kindly man will take good care of his horses even when they are worn out with age, and of his dogs, too, not only in their puppyhood, but when their old age needs nursing.

Plutarch, Cato the Elder, 4

> I am glad to learn, through those who come from you, that you live on friendly terms with your slaves. This befits a sensible and well-educated man like yourself. "They are slaves," people declare. Nay, rather they are men. "Slaves!" No, comrades. "Slaves!" No, they are unpretentious friends. "Slaves!" No, they are our fellow-slaves, if one reflects that Fortune has equal rights over slaves and free men alike.

> I do not wish to involve myself in too large a question, and to discuss the treatment of slaves, towards whom we Romans are excessively haughty, cruel, and insulting. But this is the kernel of my advice: Treat your inferiors as you would be treated by your betters. And as often as you reflect how much power you have over a slave, remember that your master has just as much power over you. "But I have no master," you say. You are still young; perhaps you will have one. Do you not know at what age Hecuba entered captivity, or Croesus, or the mother of Darius, or Plato, or Diogenes?

Seneca, [Moral letters to Lucilius XXXVII](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_47)

Maybe the most telling example of the tension between legal “rights,” social sanction, and government’s power to intervene is this story from Cassius Dio:

> This same year Vedius Pollio died, a man who in general had done nothing deserving of remembrance, as he was sprung from freedmen, belonged to the knights, and had performed no brilliant deeds; but he had become very famous for his wealth and for his cruelty, so that he has even gained a place in history. Most of the things he did it would be wearisome to relate, but I may mention that he kept in reservoirs huge lampreys that had been trained to eat men, and he was accustomed to throw to them such of his slaves as he desired to put to death. Once, when he was entertaining Augustus, his cup-bearer broke a crystal goblet, and without regard for his guest, Pollio ordered the fellow to be thrown to the lampreys. Hereupon the slave fell on his knees before Augustus and supplicated him, and Augustus at first tried to persuade Pollio not to commit so monstrous a deed. Then, when Pollio paid no heed to him, the emperor said, 'Bring all the rest of the drinking vessels which are of like sort or any others of value that you possess, in order that I may use them,' and when they were brought, he ordered them to be broken. When Pollio saw this, he was vexed, of course; but since he was no longer angry over the one goblet, considering the great number of the others that were ruined, and, on the other hand, could not punish his servant for what Augustus also had done, he held his peace, though much against his will.
