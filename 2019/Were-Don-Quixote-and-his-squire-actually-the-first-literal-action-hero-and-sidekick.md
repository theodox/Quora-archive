The invention of the hero-sidekick dynamic is far older: the title belongs to [Gilgamesh](https://www.ancient.eu/gilgamesh/) and [Enkidu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enkidu). Their relationship is the central theme of the world’s oldest epic poem, the [Epic of Gilgamesh](http://www.aina.org/books/eog/eog.pdf).

Gilgamesh was probably a historic individual — we’ve found evidence that suggests he ruled the Mesopotamian city of Uruk before about 2500 BC. However by 2100 BC he had become a figure of legend. There are a number of stories about his adventures, which remained popular in a number of languages and forms for the next two millennia.

Although there are a variety of adventure tales in the Gilgamesh cycle, the [relationship between the Gilgamesh and Enkidu is at the core of all these stories](https://stmuhistorymedia.org/enkidus-impact-on-the-epic-of-gilgamesh/). Gilgamesh was the strongest man on earth, but his power made him arrogant and tyrannical. His people prayed to the gods to protect them from the bullying king, and the gods created Enkidu, a kind of beast-man, with the strength of a wild animal but completely innocent of the ways of mankind. They fight to a draw, but their conflict becomes a fast friendship. Enkidu’s innocence helps to soften and humanize the tyrannical Gilgamesh. Enkidu’s eventual death sends Gilgamesh on a hopeless quest for the secret of eternal life; the failure of that quest teaches the hero to confront his own mortality.
