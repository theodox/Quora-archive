# Why was the Roman Empire in Jerusalem and Judea? It seems such an isolated backwater with no economic value to the empire.

There are two parts.

The boring part is plain old imperial border creep. Much of what Rome wanted was simply quiet: a stable buffer between their interests and the Parthian Empire to the east. Pompey [intervened in a messy civil war in the Hasmonean royal house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasmonean_Civil_War) but not to incorporate Judea — he wanted to put a reliable client (and one beholden to him personally) on the throne. This was the standard Roman practice of putting friendly factions in power on the fringes of the Roman domains. If the subsequent [Herodian dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodian_dynasty) had been more stable — less prone to fratricide and better at keeping their own people quiet — Judea might have enjoyed a longer run of independence, like [Osroene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osroene) and [Palmyra.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra) However the Herodian state ended up as a mess; the dynasty was squabbling and the people it ruled were restive, and the Romans assumed direct control of Judea in 6 AD. This pattern of gradually absorbing local clients is a common to many empires, from the Roman to the British.

The less well known, or at least less obvious part of the puzzle is this:

This is [balsam](https://www.ft.com/content/24347478-3e34-11e2-91cb-00144feabdc0), which was one of the most lucrative spice crops in antiquity (a period which was [absolutely obsessed with perfumes](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-Roman-thing-ever)). The Herodians had maintained what were, effectively, the world’s only commercial balsam plantations at Jericho and Ein Gedi. The revenue from these shrubs was reportedly enough to maintain two fully stocked legions (we know, because Cleopatra got Marc Antony to turn the revenues over to her). When Titus’s legions were making ready to destroy Jerusalem, [they detailed soldiers to seize the plantations lest the costly plants be destroyed by Jewish die-hards](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=LatinAugust2012&getid=1&query=Plin.%20Nat.%2012.54).

Ordinarily it’s not a great idea to look at 19th-century style mercantile motives for Roman imperialism: domestic politics and imperial paranoia account for most of Rome’s foreign adventures. But for the scent-happy Romans it’s more than likely that the highly portable, highly concentrated wealth of Judean balsam factored into somebody’s calculations.
