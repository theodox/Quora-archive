It's a big topic. Nowadays the fashionable explanations usually involve environmental or climatic change (as referenced in the other excellent answers). I'll interject my slightly biased opinion that the other hot explanation, 'systems collapse', seems difficult to distinguish from 'bad things happened' - ie, it strikes me as a non-explanation explanation. But I'm a crumudgeon.

However, for completeness's sake, there's also:

__A military revolution__ . Robert Drews argues that changes in military tactics and weaponry destabilized the 'palace economies' of Greece and Mesopotamia. [Amazon.com: The End of the Bronze Age (9780691025919): Robert Drews: Books](http://www.amazon.com/The-End-Bronze-Robert-Drews/dp/0691025916)

In the same vein: __No Tin__ . Tin is necessary for producing Bronze. It's been suggested that the drying up of tin supplies cause both economic and political chaos. Or possibly it was the appearance of __iron weapons.__ Or the two things may be part of the same process: [Iron Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age)

__Barbarian Invasions__ . which can be seen as an factor on their own or as symptoms of 'systems collapse', climate change, or other environmental disasters. [The Sea Peoples: Warriors of the Ancient Mediterranean 1250-1150 BC (Ancient Peoples & Places) (Ancient Peoples and Places): N. K. Sandars: 9780500273876: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/The-Sea-Peoples-Mediterranean-1250-1150/dp/0500273871)

__Systems collapse.__ The one I snarked about. Suggest that it was a 'globalized' international system with too many inter-dependencies which collapsed under the pressure of some of the above plus climate change. To some degree it's 'all of the above' with an emphasis on the domino effect. [1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed (Turning Points in Ancient History): Eric H. Cline: 9780691140896: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/1177-B-C-Civilization-Collapsed-Turning/dp/0691140898/ref=pd_sim_b_5?ie=UTF8&refRID=0PTW0NRWSM3YS4P791S9)

and the minimalist hypothesis:

Nothing happened. It's just a synchronicity of unrelated events that happens to fall into a gap in historical records, leaving lots of room for fun speculations.
