The probably had access to different versions of the story of the Trojan war, but it’s unlikely they had the _Iliad_ proper.

__Latin sources__ 

Irish monasteries [retained a tenuous connection to Greek ](http://anglandicus.blogspot.com/2011/11/mise-agus-pangur-ban-i-and-white-pangur.html)into at least the 9th century — but mostly for the purpose of studying the gospels, not for the study of classic literature. But they were avid collectors of Latin literature, both sacred and secular. So they almost certainly had access to at least three popular Latin-language texts that kept medieval Europe apprised of the Trojan War.

The _[De Excidio Trojae Historia](https://libstore.ugent.be/fulltxt/RUG01/001/891/500/RUG01-001891500_2012_0001_AC.pdf)_ __ (“History of the fall of Troy”) supposedly translated by Cornelius Nepos from the original by “Dares the Phrygian” but in reality a confection of the fifth century, offers a very alternative perspective on the Trojan war: it’s written from a Trojan point of view, and it definitely contradicts Homer’s version of events. It was, however, an extremely popular version of the story — and we can be sure the Irish had this one, since there’s an Irish version (the _Togail Troí_ ) in the 12th century [Book of Leinster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Leinster) and the 14th century [Book of Ballymote](https://www.ria.ie/library/catalogues/special-collections/medieval-and-early-modern-manuscripts/book-ballymote-leabhar). The _Togail Troí_ expands on the Latin original and includes a lot of characteristically Irish touches; there’s a good rundown of the way the story was adapted [here.](https://www.persee.fr/doc/ecelt_0373-1928_1980_num_17_1_1654)

The other side of the Trojan war story was presented by the _[Ephemeris belli Trojani](https://digiliblt.uniupo.it/opera.php?id=DLT000144&gruppo=opere&iniziale=all)_ _(“Diary of the Trojan War”)_ written by a fourth century Roman author named Septimius, but attributed to “Dictys of Crete”. English version [here](https://www.theoi.com/Text/DictysCretensis1.html). Dictys was also popular and widely accessible.

The[ Ilias Latina ](https://plex.page/Ilias_Latina)is a sort of a poetic “greatest hits” reel for the Iliad, in a mere 1070 lines (the original is closer to 16,000). It’s certainly no match for Homer in depth of characterization or verve — but on the other hand, it also has a lot less repetition and space-filling catalogues of proper names. Baebius is no Homer — but his version was a common view of the Trojan War available in the Latin-speaking world from around the sixth to the fourteenth century.

On top of these, of course, there was the _Aeneid_ , which also introduced a few Homeric incidents and characters. Oddly, though, the character of Aeneas in medieval retellings is often rather negative thanks to the influence of Dares and Dictys who depict him as selling out the Trojan cause. Troilus (who would go on to fame in Chaucer’s [Troilus and Criseyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troilus_and_Criseyde)) becomes the most important Trojan hero. This kind of divergence from Homer wasn’t unique to Ireland — before the 14th century, most European writers believed Dares and Dictys were the true authorities on the Trojan war and the poetic versions that referenced in Ovid or Vergil had to be “corrected” by reference to these “historical” texts.

__Examples__ 

So, an Irish writer had plenty of ways to be familiar with the story of Troy. The version they got, however, was not quite the one you’d know from your college Classics course.

The Trojan story appears in a couple of other Irish sources besides _Togail Troí_ .

The _[Merugud Uilix Maicc Leirtis](https://www.yorku.ca/inpar/ulixes_meyer.pdf)_ __ (“Wanderings of Ulysses Son of Laertes”) is also found in the Book of Ballymote; it’s a retelling of the story of Ulysses with some interesting twists (Odysseus meets Aeneas while sailing; instead of unsealing the bag of winds on the sea, Ulysses’ men steal a box of gold and get lost on the road; Ulysses comes home and finds Penelope in bed with Telemachus!).

In The _[Clann Ollaman Uaisle Emna](https://www.vanhamel.nl/codecs/Clann_Ollaman_uaisle_Emna)_  (“The Children of Ollam, the Nobles of Emain”) compares heroes of the Ulster Cycle to the heroes of the Trojan War — Paris, for example, is matched with [Naoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoise), another lover whose affair precipitated a terrible war. Cú Chulainn is compared not to Achilles but to (the appropriately boosted ) Troilus; and Fergus equates to Aeneas:

> Troilus and Cú Chulainn are equivalent in their combats, their lifespan, and their fortunes; Aeneas is Fergus where exile is concerned — a bright, constant pair who were not moderate in Battle

(it’s hard to find this in English, citation [here](https://trans-cuchulainn.tumblr.com/post/182562977718/achilles-and-cu-chulainn-are-very-similar-and))

Finally there’s the _[Imtheachta Aeniasa](https://www.yorku.ca/inpar/aeniasa_calder.pdf)_ _,_ the Irish Aeneid — closer (but not that close) to Virgil’s version. It’s probably the oldest known vernacular edition of the Aeneid.

And there’s a book-length study of the relation between Irish heroic literature and the classics:
