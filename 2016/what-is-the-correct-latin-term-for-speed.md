In classical Latin, _[celeritas](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dceleritas)_ __ is the usual word, although _[velocitas](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=velocitas&la=la&can=velocitas0&prior=tarditas&d=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=celeritas&i=2#lexicon)_ __ also works for many of the meanings of our “speed.” The former is a better match for ‘speed’ in the sense of ‘how fast is something moving,’ the latter is more like ‘speediness’ or ‘rapidity.’ It can be used where we might use “speed” in some contexts, but in classical Latin you probably would not say something like _ambulans cum velocitate 3 pedum per secundum,_ ie, “walking with a speed of 3 feet per second”. _Magna cum celeritate_ would be “with great speed,” ie, “fast.”

_Velocitas_  for ‘velocity’ in our sense goes back to the Middle Ages; it’s in Albertus Magnus and Buridan, for example, as well as (later on) Francis Bacon and Newton. I don’t know when the specialized meaning took over; the word is still used for a personal quality in Boethius (around the year 500) but by the 12th century at least it’s the usual scientific word for speed; it might go back to a usage in the translations of Aristotle which became popular in the 10th and 11th centuries.
