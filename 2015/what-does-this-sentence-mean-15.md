The original version of the [Schlieffen Plan](http://www.britannica.com/event/Schlieffen-Plan), Germany's master plan for dealing with a two-front war against France in the west and Russia in the east banked on a fast knockout blow against France with only a skeleton force defending against the Russians. The idea was to concentrate against the smaller enemy while banking on the inefficiency of Russian mobilization to buy time.

The plan was extremely aggressive by conventional military standards (Schlieffen himself wanted to attack France in 1905 while Russia was embroiled in the Russo-Japanese war). Political and military authorities both worried about the risks of stripping the eastern front of defenses. After Schlieffen's tenure as chief of staff ended, his successor [von Moltke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Younger) modified the plan in light of these worries, using a smaller force on the western front and avoiding an invasion of neutral Holland. 

The quote implies that German HQ regarded these changes as the reason for the failure of the initial attack in 1914. It might not be completely accurate, however, since many high ranking officers (including Moltke, the chief of staff) thought the Schlieffen plan was too risky. The views in the quote reflect those of some, not all of the German officer corps.
