Europe’s “Roman” identity dissolved gradually between the 6th and the 10th centuries.

The new kingdoms of the 5th and 6th centuries all established clear legal and political distinction between Romans and the new, barbarian elite. So, for example, the [Lex Burgundionum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Burgundionum#targetText=The%20Lex%20Burgundionum%20(Latin%20for,regulating%20weregild%20and%20other%20penalties) of the kingdom of Burgundy had two sides: a “Roman” side based on traditional Roman law for the “Roman” subjects, and a Burgundian side based on Germanic traditional law recast into Latin for the purpose of recording — each brand of law had different rules about transmission of property or criminal procedure. Most of the early medieval kindgoms used the same procedure, which tended to reinforce a legal and ethnic distinction between “Romans” and the barbarian ruling classes. So if you asked a 7th or 8th century person in France if he was a Roman, it would be an entirely factual question that you could probably answer for yourself by observing their dress, listening to their language, or knowing where they lived.

The distinction broke down over time in a couple of ways. As the barbarian upper classes embraced orthodox Catholicism (many of the original invaders were Christians, but of the Arian variety) one important barrier to intermarriage disappeared. In the Carolingian period the revival of central authority created many opportunities for “Romans” to achieve power in the service of the state as [ministerials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerialis#targetText=Ministerialis%20(plural%20ministeriales%3B%20a%20post,positions%20of%20power%20and%20responsibility), which tended to erode the original ethnic distinction between rulers and ruled. The newly empowered kings also tended to rationalize their legal codes to apply to all — their frequent struggles against their own barons meant that ethnic solidarity began to take a back seat to the power of the state. And lastly, but probably most important, the emergence of vernacular languages provided a new set of identities based on regional speech that replaced the old dualities of Roman and barbarian.

The old Roman idea retained a lot of prestige, as you can see from (for example) this coin of Charlemagne:

However by Charlemagne’s time Rome was clearly a historic, rather than a living inheritance for most Europeans. By the 10th century or so the idea of [translatio imperii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translatio_imperii) or the “handover of power”, the sequence of empires in which Rome passed its power on to successor states just as Babylon, Persia, and Greece had done was becoming fairly common.

Western usage of “Romans” for Byzantines lasted at least until about the 10th century. The famous pull quote here is from [Liutprand of Cremona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liutprand_of_Cremona), the worst diplomat in history, who delivered (or at least, told people he had delivered) this little gem to the Byzantine emperor in 963

> "History tells us that Romulus, from whom the Romans get their name, was a fratricide born in adultery. He made a place of refuge for himself and received into it insolvent debtors, runaway slaves, murderers and men who deserved death for their crimes. This was the sort of crowd whom he enrolled as citizens and gave them the name of Romans. From this nobility are descended those men whom you style 'rulers of the world.' But we Lombards, Saxons, Franks, Lotharingians, Bavarians, Swabians and Burgundians, so despise these fellows that when we are angry with an enemy we can find nothing more insulting to say than -'You Roman!' For us in the word Roman is comprehended every form of lowness, timidity, avarice, luxury, falsehood and vice.

One can only wonder what Liutprand’s twitter account would have looked like.
