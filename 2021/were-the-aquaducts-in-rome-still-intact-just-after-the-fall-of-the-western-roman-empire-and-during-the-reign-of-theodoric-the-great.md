The sack of Rome and the subsequent depopulation (particularly after the Vandal conquest of Africa in 435, which made it impossible for Rome to rely on massive North African grain shipments) led to disinvestment and the decline of the water supply, though the aqueducts still functioned through the fifth century.

The real damage to the Roman water supply happened during the [Gothic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_War_(535%E2%80%93554)). The Gothic leader [Vitiges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiges) cut the aqueducts in 537 as part of a long, failed siege:

> So the Goths…. tore open all the aqueducts, so that no water at all could enter the city from them. Now the aqueducts of Rome are fourteen in number, and were made of baked brick by the men of old, being of such breadth and height that it is possible for a man on horseback to ride in them.

Procopius, Gothic War 1.13

In response, the Roman general Belisarius, commanding the city, filled several of the aqueducts with masonry to prevent the Goths from infiltrating them (Belisarius himself had taken Naples from the Goths the by means of a disused aqueduct) there.

Water supply aside, the generation-long conflict devastated Rome’s population. When the conflict ground down in 554 Rome’s population was in the ballpark of only 30,000, the city having repeatedly changed hands over the course of 29 bloody years.

Nonetheless, the city needed some water. The [Aqua Virgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Virgo), which was largely underground, remained partially operable into the 10th century or so. The [Alexandrina ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Alexandrina)and the [Traiana ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Traiana)were sporadically recommissioned, the first into the 8th century, the second into the 12thc.

The sporadic reconstructions reflect both the meagre resources and the meagre needs of medieval Rome. The population meandered in a range between 3 and 6 % of the early-imperial peak. Even if money and manpower were available to restore the aqueducts, the population needed only a sliver of the water which it had once required.
