# The Gandhara sculpture owed as much to the Romans as to the Greeks. What is an explanation to this?

I think it’s probably more accurate to say that Gandhara and Roman art both reflected the tastes of the Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman empire, rather than that Roman tastes influenced Gandhara very directly. Gandhara art was influenced by Greek communities that followed in Alexander’s wake, particularly the [Greco-Bactrian Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom) and the [Indo-Greek Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek_Kingdom); these communities remained in contact with the Greek cultural world even though they were no longer part of the Greek or Roman political orbit. Bactria, the Greek kingdoms and Gandhara all were intermediaries on the east-west trade routes that would eventually become the famous Silk Road, and the Gandhara, so they were far from being out of touch with developments to the west or the east. In the Gandhara period the main drivers of taste on the western end of the road were the wealthy Greeks of the eastern half of the empire, even though the political mastery belonged to Rome.

The key marker of distinctive ‘Roman’ taste in sculpture was a precise, even exagerrated attention to individual personalities, in contrast to the idealization that was very common in Greek sculpture. Of course that always co-existed with an ongoing Greek tradition and the balance between the two bounced back and forth over time; but as a generalization it holds up reasonably well.

Also, the densely packed, billowy surfaces of Gandhara reliefs seem to reflect what was called the ‘Asiatic ‘ style (after the Roman province of Asia, ie, modern Turkey). This mixture of architectural motifs and soft, curvy forms with exaggerated draping was also a popular style in Rome but it originated in the wealthy Greek cities of Asia Minor rather than Italy.
