Nope - they are Egyptian, which survives today in a somewhat antiquated form as [Coptic.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language) Coptic is part of the same [Afroasiatic ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages)family as Semitic languages, but it’s not an offshoot of the Semitic family. There’s not a lot of agreement among scholars about how to relate the different subdivisions of that group.
