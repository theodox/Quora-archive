The "fall of the west" was a long process, but one that really crystallized when the [Rhine frontier was breached](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_of_the_Rhine) quite badly in 405/6. Several barbarian peoples, most notably the Vandals, Alans, and Suebi got across the river.

_This gives the wrong impression, but it's kinda cool. Gibbon guessed (there's no evidence) that the tribes crossed the Rhine in a deep winter freeze._ 

The defenses had been stripped to mount a defense of Italy against an invasion by the Goths coming through Austria (much of the background is covered in [What were the sackings of Rome in the year 410 by the Goths and Vandals like? Were they organized or did they just ride through the city slashing, burning and pillaging?](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging)) The TLDR is that there was a lot of confusing political infighting between the Western Romans, the Goths, the Eastern Romans, and the various tribal kings and the Romans were unable to cooperate or mount an effective defense across the whole theater).

The "invasion" was not a D-Day style organized military assault, or barbarian horde washing over a Chinese-wall style fortification; Roman tactics were designed around using a network of forts, watchtowers and strong points to slow down and harass an enemy giving the main 'field force' (the [Comitatenses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comitatenses), possibly supported by the [Palatini ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatini_(Roman_military))"guards" troops) time to form and defeat the enemy in open battle. The Rhine crossing, however, came when the Roman field forces, such as they were, were occupied in Italy: the Romans effectively faced a _fait accompli_ . It is worth keeping in mind that the absolute numbers were not huge: the Gothic army that sacked Rome, for example, was probably around 40,000 men. These invasions were not a huge inundation of people, although more and more people followed over the next decades once the Romans clearly lost control over the frontiers.

Since so many barbarian groups were already part of the Roman military -- either as allied contingents or as immigrants -- the Romans found it easier to cut deals; many of the invading leaders got Roman titles and land in return for allying with the Romans against other tribes. The Vandals, for example, were granted "allied" status and settled in northern Spain in 409; the Visigoths - despite having sacked Rome in 410 - got the same deal in southern France sometime around 415.

However the Roman system of alliances was crumbling fast, and the "allies" went to war against Rome and each other with depressing frequency. Again, it's important not to think of this like a modern war: this was a confused furball of opportunistic factions: it's more like the modern Middle East than WWII: the leaders played musical chairs but ordinary people mostly watched from the sidelines, unless they were unlucky enough to be in the path of an actual battle.

The Visigoths pushed the Vandals out of Spain around 418 and settled their themselves (the Vandals ended up in the province of Africa, establishing the a Germanic kingdom with it's capital at Carthage 1525 years before the Afrika Korps). The Visigoths held onto most of Spain until the Moorish conquest of 8th century. During the long stretch from 418 to 711 Hispania was sometimes a nominal part of the Eastern empire ([Justinian](http://Justinian) recovered the southeastern coast, including modern Cartagena, Cordova and Cadiz

The Visigothic kingdom warred with the Franks, the Byzantines and the other smaller barbarian groups (and, like everyone else in Spanish history, with the Basques). They gradually fused with their "Roman" or "Hispanian" subjects. Around the same time as they completed the conquest of the peninsula, the Visigothic royal family converted to Catholicism (like many of the barbarian invaders of 406 the Visigoths were Christians - but of the Arian rather than the Catholic variety). Sharing the religion of their subjects made it easier for the Visigoths to begin building a coherent national identity; the Spanish nation which was submerged under the Moorish conquest was really created during the 6th and 7th centuries by the Visigoths: [The Visigoths in Spain](http://www.spainthenandnow.com/spanish-history/visigoths-in-spain/default_154.aspx)
