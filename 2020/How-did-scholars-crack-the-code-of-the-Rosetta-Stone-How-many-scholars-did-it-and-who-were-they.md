The primary credit goes to the French Egyptologist [Jean-François Champollion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Champollion), who used a trilingual text known as the [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) which contained some recognizable Greek proper names to establish sound values for several hieroglyphs. With sound values he was able to prove that other parts of the text corresponded to Coptic — in other words, that the language of the inscriptions was the direct ancestor of the living Coptic language. Other scholars who were imporant to the unravelling of hieroglyphic — which is only partly an alphabetic script and has a lot of complexities beyond just sound values — are [Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist)) and [Johan David Åkerblad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_David_%C3%85kerblad); the exact balance of credit has been debated for the last couple of centuries.

The details of how the decipherment was actually achieved are covered in this answer:
