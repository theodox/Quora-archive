Among other things Egypt had it's own characteristic board game, [Senet. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senet)The rules, alas, are not preserved -- but there are a couple of attempts at reconstructing them, [such as this one. ](http://legacy.mos.org/quest/pdf/senet.pdf)It's usually assumed be somewhat like Backgammon.

Here's King Tut's excellent Senet table (were he around today I bet King Tut would have an account on [geekchichq)](http://www.geekchichq.com/collections/game-room-tables)

And Queen Nefertari playing what looks like a solo game, around 1300 BC.
