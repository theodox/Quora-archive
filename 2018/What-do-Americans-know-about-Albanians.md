For most folks it might get as far as the Belushi brothers and Eliza Dushku… unless you count [Action Bronson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Bronson) — America’s only Albanian celebrity chef turned rapper.

It’s a different in the New York-New Jersey area, where there’s a pretty big community. There are neighborhoods in Yonkers and the Bronx where it seems like every other wall has a double eagle or a “Free Kosovo” painted on it. There it fits the standard immigrant-enclave pattern, with a mix of assimilation, ethnic politics, and clannishness.

The Albanian bar scene in Yonkers and in the Bronx had a pretty rough reputation for organized crime back in the 90’s, though I don’t know what it’s like today — again, part of the standard ethnic enclave pattern in big cities.
