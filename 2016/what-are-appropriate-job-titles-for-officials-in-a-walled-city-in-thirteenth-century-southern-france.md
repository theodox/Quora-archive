Here's a few options

Generally a city citizen would be a _burgeis_ or “burgess”. In some kinds of towns by definition being a burgess would also make you a city councillor.

A [Syndic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndic), might be a city councilman or, if the city was more like an Italian commune, a mayor.

[Capitoul ](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/capitoul#English)in Toulouse for a mayor.

[Consul ](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/consul#English)or [jurat ](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/jurat#English)for a city councilor

[bailif ](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/bailif#Old_French)for a court officer.

The designated representative of the count is a _Vicar._
