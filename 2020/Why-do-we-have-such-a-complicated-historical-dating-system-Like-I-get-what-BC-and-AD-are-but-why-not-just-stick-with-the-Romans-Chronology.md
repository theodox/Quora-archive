# Why do we have such a complicated historical dating system? Like I get what BC and AD are, but why not just stick with the Romans Chronology?

If it’s simplicity you crave, that’s not the way to go. The Romans did not really have a native serial dating system at all; the most common way to date a year was “in the consulship of X and Y” (you needed two consul names because plenty of people held the office many times).

Historians would occasionally use dates calculated__ _[ab urbe condita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_urbe_condita)_ _,_ “from the building of the city” which was legendarily supposed to be our 753 BC. But that was a way of setting context for important events, and was generally calculated by hand from lists of of consular years, many of which were somewhat shaky. In any event, the AUC system was not how most people thought about time (more on that [here](https://www.quora.com/If-you-asked-a-Roman-in-30-AD-what-year-was-it-what-would-he-she-answer/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=3c0c021e&srid=zLvM)) — to ordinary Romans there was no real equivalent of a “Happy New Year AUC 701!”

The closest the Romans came to such a thing was the celebration of the _[ludi saeculares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_Games)_ _,_ nominally to be celebrated once every 110 years but in practice somewhat more flexible. The two most famous celebrations were put on by emperor Claudius (as an amateur historian, he was familiar with AUC dating) for the city’s 800th birthday and a slightly mistimed celebration by emperor [Phillipus Arabus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_the_Arab), who celebrated the city’s 1000th birthday in what was actually AUC 1001.

_A coin of Phillipus, celebrating Rome’s 1000th aniversary though in this case issued in AUC 1001. The reverse legend is SAECULUM NOVUM, “a new era”._ 

So, AUC dating only really impinged a little less than once a century on average. There were multiple problems even there, because the Roman calendar was very poorly aligned with the solar year until [Julius Caesar’s calendar reforms ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar)(in our 46 BC) got it pretty close. However it didn’t really achieve modern levels of precision until the 1520’s, when the Pope’s [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#:~:text=The%20Gregorian%20calendar%20is%20the,Earth's%20revolution%20around%20the%20Sun) — which took more than 400 years to become the dominant (though far from the only) way to reckon years.

The Roman bureaucracy eventually did adopt serial dating, starting under emperor Diocletian — their tax system (the most visible arm of government to ordinary people) was based around our year 284. That [still forms the starting point for the calendar of the Egyptian Coptic Church](https://www.quora.com/If-we-assume-people-in-100-AD-did-not-know-the-year-accurately-when-did-humankind-start-to-record-dates-consistently-relative-to-our-calendar-now/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=e74b52fa&srid=zLvM), which knows it as the “era of martyrs.” Distaste for using Diocletian — an enthusiastic persecutor of Christians — as a reference point led the Scythian monk [Dionysius Exiguus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_Exiguus) to reframe his own calendar around his guess for the year of Christs birth: he just added 284 to the Diocletianic era. However his guess about the year of Christ’s birth was different from what most other churchmen believed: the more usual estimate under early Christians was one or two years earlier.

In any case __all serial dating systems share the same problem:__  you’ll still eventually go back to negative numbers, unless of course you want to start with the Creation (which is [how the Jewish and Byzantine calendars work ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Mundi#:~:text=Anno%20Mundi%20(Latin%20for%20%22in,the%20world%20and%20subsequent%20history.)— though their estimates for the date of the Creation are rather… low… by modern standards).

_If AD/BC calculations are exhausting, one could use the Masonic_ “anno lucis” _calendar, which is a simplified version of_ anno mundi_dating from a creation assumed to be 4,000 years before our 1 AD. That covers all written history in positive numbers, so as long as you don’t need to talk about the Ice Age or dinosaurs the math is easy._
