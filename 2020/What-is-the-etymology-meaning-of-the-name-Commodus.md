Originally it will have been “correctly weighted out or measured”, and thus by extension “appropriate”. A good one-word translation might be “fitting” in English, which likewise evolved from describing correct proportions to a general sense of utility for a purpose or aptitude.

From the basic sense of fitness, _commodus_ extends into a generic term indicating all kinds of serviceability, convenience, or utility— this is how it ends up as the root of English words like _commodious_ or _accommodate._ 

Rather ironic, actually given who the most famous possessor of the name was.

Here’s a [good survey of historic usage](http://It’s roughly “fitting” — https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-etymology-meaning-of-the-name-Commodus?show_editor=True).
