# When did Sulla change the interest rates in Rome? Was it during his first Consulship (88 BCE) or dictatorship (82-79 BCE)? I've got conflicting sources between English and Latin Wikipedia.

The citation is not very clear, but it does tell us the date:

> _Unciaria lex dici coepta est quam L. Sulla et Q. Pompeius tulerunt, qua sanctum est debitores deciman partem [….]_ 

That would put in 88, the year when Sulla and Pompeius were consuls.

It’s usually understood as a response to a currency crisis which emerged in the wake of the [Social War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_War_(91%E2%80%9387_BC)#:~:text=The%20Social%20War%20(from%20Latin,socii)%20of%20Rome%20for%20centuries.) (91–87BC). In the same year as Sulla’s law the praetor, Aulus Sempronius Asellio, was murdered in the forum by angry creditors who believed he was too lenient with debtors.

While Sulla was off campaigning in the east, the government of Cinna also tried (without much success) to address the financial crisis. Measures included the [currency reform of Gratidianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourr%C3%A9e) (85) and the [debt cancellation of Flaccus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Valerius_Flaccus_(consul_86_BC)) (86).
