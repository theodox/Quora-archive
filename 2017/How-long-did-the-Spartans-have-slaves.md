If you want to be really pedantic about it, we are not sure the Spartans actually had “slaves.” What they definitely had were [Helots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helots), who were essentially state serfs rather than private property. An individual Spartan could not sell a helot, while an Athenian or Theban could sell a slave at any time. Helots could not be sent out of Spartan territory except when accompanying Spartans on campaign.

Helots generally lived in separate communities, doing unpaid labor for the Spartans but having intact families and traditions independent of the wishes of their masters. Helots were also “owned” — or at least controlled — by the state rather than individual owners. Most helots were tenant farmers whose main interaction with the Spartan was to hand over a portion of whatever food or goods they produced to whomever the Spartan state designated. In short, they were more like medieval villeins than chattel slaves; something in between free and unfree.

That didn’t make them happy: the pro-Spartan Xenophon said the helots “would happily eat their masters raw” if given the chance, and the whole history of Sparta was consumed by fear of a helot revolt. Unlike slaves, helots had their own communities and traditions which made it far easier for them to plot revenge against the Spartans. There were major helot rebellions several times in the 5th, 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Fear of a helot rising led to repressive tactics on the part of the Spartans, including [random murders and a pervasive spy system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypteia).

On the other hand the Spartans [sometimes resorted to freeing helots when they were in need of manpower](http://www.ancient.eu/Neodamodeis/): a loyal helot who served in combat could be freed or even become a Spartan citizen. Spartans could also adopt helot children (or, more often, [children of a helot mother and a Spartiate father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothax)) and raise them as full Spartans. Like most other versions of ancient slavery, there were a lot of variants over time and according to the needs and feelings of those in power.

Helotry as an institution survived until very close to the end of Spartan independence, but clearly it had changed from its infamous beginnings. The romantic revolutionary king [Cleomenes III ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleomenes_III)allowed any helot who could afford 5 silver minae to buy Spartan citizenship, which suggests that in his day Spartans were willing to put aside their traditional attitudes towards the helots — but more importantly that there were helots with substantial private property, since 5 minae is the equivalent of about 9 months worth of skilled labor: a hefty sum for “slaves” to raise. Cleomenes enrolled 6,000 former helots in his army — but [Livy](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/From_the_Founding_of_the_City/Book_34#27) says there were still helots a generation later when [Nabis,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabis) the last king of Sparta, fought and lost to the Romans in 195 BC. Sparta lost its independence after that and there’s not later mention of helots, though (like the rest of Greece) Roman era Sparta always had the more conventional form of slavery.
