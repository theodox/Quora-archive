It was a complex linguistic mix.

Ordinary Egyptians spoke what we call [Demotic Egyptian](https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/demotic-dictionary-oriental-institute-university-chicago). It’s one stop on the evolutionary line from the Old Egyptian of the early pharaohs to the Coptic language which is still used by the Coptic Church in Egypt. More conservative forms of the language remained in use for religious purposes, though the knowledge was beginning to fade. After the end of the fourth century AD nobody in Egypt would remember how to read hieroglyphics. Demotic was written in a cursive script but over the course of the Roman period Egyptians adopted a variant of the Greek alphabet, which is still in use today.

_This looks like Greek, but it’s actually Coptic: late Demotic Egyptian written in a Greek-like alphabet. A bible from around the year 300_ 

About a third of the population was “Greek,” though how much of that is due to immigration and how much reflects Egyptians adopting Hellenic culture and names is not clear. Under Rome most of the cities remained primarily Greek speaking. Much of the native Egyptian population were essentially serfs, bound to the countryside. Roman records are full of accounts of efforts to keep the peasants from moving to the cities; it was not unlike the Chinese [Hukou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system) system. But — in part because the plantation based Egyptian economy was administered by Greek speaking bureaucrats — [we know far more about “Roman” daily life from Greek documents about Egyptians than from any other source](https://www.amazon.com/Egypt-under-Roman-Classics-Papyrology/dp/0788505602/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1512189401&sr=8-1&keywords=life+in+egypt+roman+rule): the dry climate of Egypt has preserved far more of the paperwork of Egypt than of the rest of the empire put together.

There was also a sizable Jewish population, particularly in Alexandria. Egyptian Jews spoke a mix of Greek and Aramaic with Hebrew as a liturgical language but not, at this stage, the primary language of daily life. The Jewish community was large and prosperous until the [Kitos War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War), under Trajan, which ended with the virtual extermination of the Jews in Egypt.

Plutarch wrote of Cleopatra that she [could speak to all her subjects in their own languages](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-nine-languages-that-Cleopatra-spoke). This was notable, since as far as we know none of her Ptolemaic predecessors bothered to learn Egyptian. He says she could speak with Ethiopians, Troglodytes, Hebrews, Arabs, Syrians, and Median or Parthians, which is usually assumed to mean seven languages in addition to Greek or Egyptian. However it might be less: The Jews, Syrians and Medians — and possibly the Parthians — might all have spoken Aramaic, which had been the _lingua franca_ of the old Persian Empire and remained a vital language of business in the Near East and Syria. Ethiopian is presumably [Napatan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meroitic_language) from the Kingdom of Meroe, just to the south of Egypt; “Troglodyte” would be the language of the tribes dwelling people between the Nile and the Red Sea, an area known as Troglodytica — it’s probably related to Libyan or Berber. The Arabs would have spoken Arabic, of course. If the Troglodyte language was a variant of Libyan / Berber, that would cover the Libyan population which occupied the hinterlands of Cyrenaica and the oasis of Siwa to the west of Egypt.

In the Roman period there were also Latin speakers, though these were a distinct minority. Romans who came for trade or administration were usually conversant with Greek. However we have found bilingual texts in Egypt intended to help Greek speakers learn Latin — knowledge of Latin was particularly important for aspiring lawyers (later, the the biggest Latin-language law school would be in what’s now Beirut).
