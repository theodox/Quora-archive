This is a good example of the pitfalls of multiple choice questions!

All of these groups were, at one point or another, Roman allies. Only __Aksum__ , out of the groups listed, never fought _against_  the Romans, which would be a good case for __(a)__ . On the other hand the Roman-Axumite alliance was relatively inconsequential: it really only became important during the [Iberian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_War) of 526–532.

The __Franks__  could base a claim on the fact that eventually — in the person of Charlemagne — the Franks recreated the Roman empire in the west. On the other hand they were also instrumental in the dismantling of that empire in the first place.

__Arabs__  were on-again, off-again allies for many centuries while the Romans squared off against first the Parthians and then the Sassanians. There were long periods of cooperation, particularly during the [height of the Roman spice trade](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-Roman-thing-ever/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=30ac9386&srid=zLvM). On the other hand it was the Arabs who eventually destroyed the Roman world forever during the wars of Islamic conquest. Given that Arab armies twice tried to storm the Roman capital at Constantinople they don’t really deserve a “world’s best ally!” mug.

The kingdom of [Osroene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osroene), whose ruling family was Arab, was one of the longest-lived Roman client kingdoms and one which seems less given to switching sides than many of the other frontier states.

The __Armenians__ , like the Arabs, had a long relationship with Rome. More often than not they were Roman allies in the endless series of wars with Parthia and Persia; two Roman legions bore the title __[Armeniaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legio_I_Armeniaca)__ __.__ On the other hand “more often than not” is probably something like “two times out of three” here: every internal faction within Armenia could always find a Roman or a Persian backer, Armenia switched sides repeatedly as different groups struggled for local advantage.

A big black mark on Armenian claims for a “best ally” award is the disaffection shown by the Armenian contingent in the East Roman army at [Yarmuk](https://historycooperative.org/heraclius-and-the-early-islamic-conquests-an-analysis-of-byzantine-military-failure-at-the-battle-of-yarmuk-in-ad-636/#_ftn23) in 636, which was instrumental in the Arab victory and the loss of Syria to the Muslim armies of the Caliphate.



So: it’s a tough call. A good deal depends on how you define “greatest.” Other Roman allies contributed more to the long-term fortunes of the empire than Aksum: [Numidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numidia) cavalry were the most famous horsemen in Roman service, for example. [Palmyra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra) saved the Roman East from a Sassanid invasion — although not long after Palmyra nearly grabbed the eastern provinces for itself. On the civilian side [Emesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homs#Emesani_dynasty_and_Roman_rule) was a key trade partner, so rich that the last descendants of Cleopatra married into the royal family, and that eventually Emesans ended up as Roman emperors of the [Severan dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severan_dynasty). And of course there was loyalty: the [Bosporan Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosporan_Kingdom) was not a vital strategic partner of the Romans but it was a generally loyal ally for over three centuries.

Short answer? This really ought to be an essay question.
