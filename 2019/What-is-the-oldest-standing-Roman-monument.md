For a given value of standing it is the [Lapis Niger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_Niger), which sits about five feet below the modern surface of the Roman forum. It is very old, dating to the half-legendary days of the Roman kingdom — the inscription, in fact, is one of only _two_  extant ones which refer to a Roman king.

The quibble about standing comes from the fact that the Romans themselves deliberately enclosed the monument and an adjacent altar in an underground chamber which was then paved over; we don’t know why, and whether they did this to protect an ancient monument from the elements or for some religious reason.
