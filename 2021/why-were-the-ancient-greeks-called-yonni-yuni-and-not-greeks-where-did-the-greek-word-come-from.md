All of the Y- or J- related exonyms — things like _Yaunâ_ (Persian), _Yona_ and _Yavana_ (both Sanskrit), _Yevan_ (Hebrew) and their many derivatives across South Asia and the Middle East all the way to _Yuan_ in older Chinese — derive from the archaic pronunciation of the name “Ionians.” the Greek-speaking communities of Asia Minor.

The name was originally Ἰάϝoνες , something like “Yahwones” so it’s clear that the exonym is quite old — it probably goes back to the Assyrian empire, who used _ia-u-na-a-a_ and _ya-a’_ as far back as the 8th century BC. The Persians are probably the most responsible for the popularization of the name, since they ruled both Ionia and many of the territories where the name entered local languages for some hundreds of years.

_Greek_ ultimately comes from a not-entirely-flattering Roman name. Latin _Graecus_ comes from Greek Γραικός, “_Graekos”_  whose origins aren’t entirely clear. Aristotle uses is for some of the inhabitants of Epirus, who lived on the western coast of Greece opposite Italy; some other writers claim it’s a very old name for the central Greek heartland of Pthia. In any case the Romans associated it with Greek-speakers even though it was an obscure name which very few Greek speakers used for themselves.

The real route by which the name _Graecus_ entered Latin is not obvious. The likeliest case is that Latin speakers took a word that applied to people they interacted with (maybe settlers in southern Italy who used the word for some reason, or maybe those folks from Epirus) and expanded it to other users of the same language. By well-documented times they were aware of the main word the Greeks used for themselves — _Hellenes_ , Ἕλληνες, still the preferred term in Modern Greek — but they stuck with _Graecus_ for the most part.

_Hellenes_ was always a tricky word in any case — it identified people of Hellenic culture and language but never represented a single political entity. An individual would identify as a Hellene in contrast to a “barbarian” (ie, the rest of the world) but would be much more likely to dwell on their identity as citizen of a particular city or, secondarily, as subjects of a particular king.
