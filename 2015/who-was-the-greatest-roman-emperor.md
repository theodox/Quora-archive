Honestly, I don't think there's much competition for [Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus](http://www.ancient.eu/augustus/), aka. Augustus

If only because he is one of the very few Roman emperors who managed to leave the place clearly better than he found it. He did that not just in the proverbial _I found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble_  way, with showy monument and engineering feats: he gave peace and freedom from war and fear to millions for almost half a century.

He was an interesting character: a murderous military dictator who managed to outgrow his origins (as a completely illegitimate, self-appointed generalissimo) to establish a stable, more or less orderly Roman state in which the reality of absolute power was at least pleasantly disguised by a Republican facade. Although he seized power illegally and with great violence and loss of life -- he earned the nickname of 'the young assassin' for his part in the proscriptions of the 2d Triumvirate -- he ruled moderately. He deferred to civilian law as much as he dared, though like all Roman emperors he never subordinated himself to civilian control. 

However, his greatest -- and unmatched -- accomplishment was simple longevity. 

Simply by staying alive so long, over-awing potential challengers, he allowed Rome a desperately needed breathing space after an endless series of civil conflicts ([twelve of them ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_civil_wars)in the century between 133 and 30 BC!) He gave the Roman world four decades of peace at home and most of the time abroad. He also reformed the administration of the provinces, rendering the Roman yoke much less burdensome to the provincial peoples. For the first time the entire Mediterranean basin was a functional, more or less peaceful social and economic unit: a fact that produced unprecedented prosperity for Romans and non-Romans alike. Uncounted millions of Romans and non-Romans lived less precarious, more prosperous lives because of Augustus.

For second place honors it's also a pretty simple choice. 

Marcus Ulpius Nerva Traianus, aka [T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan)[rajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan), was one of history's golden boys: he brought the empire to its greatest territorial extent and prosperity. Unlike Augustus he was handed a functional state and a wealthy, more or less coherent society; he did however have the signal honor of not screwing up -- an underappreciated talent in emperors. 

He also also deserves a lot of credit for smacking down the Praetorians (for why that's a good thing, see [Why was the Roman succession so violent? Why weren't they able to establish a functional succession system like other large empires?](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires)) Trajan only became emperor because the Praetorians foisted him onto the well meaning, but ineffectual [Nerva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerva) at swordpoint: Trajan summoned the leaders to his military headquarters 'to collect their due' -- and had them executed. He handed the ceremonial sword of the leader to the highest ranking survivor, he said "If I rule well, use this sword for me. If I rule badly, use it against me."

His main debit is probably the long-term costs of his glorious conquests: the Mesopotamian territories were lost pretty quickly, and if you believe in the "overextension" theory of later Roman decline Trajan bears some responsibility for the spiral of military expense that eventually burdened the empire beyond its ability to pay. There are also some scholars who don't by the 'forced adoption' story and view Trajan as the leader of a smooth and well managed coup. And lastly, it's not entirely clear that his 'heir' Hadrian was actually his heir at all, or the engineer of a palace coup.

Nonetheless, Trajan borrowed many pages from Augustus' script: respecting the prestige and experience of the Senate, simulating obedience to the laws well enough to keep the facade of a free society intact, and in general ruling as humanely and modestly as a military autocrat can. The fact that -- like Augustus -- he has very few real critics among the ancient sources suggests he did something right.
