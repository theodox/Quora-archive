An intrusion; it's not Greek at all.

The Kraken is [a creature out of Norse Mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken), a sea monster that supposedly lived somewhere near Iceland and ate ships. It's only "Greek" because of it was inexplicably included in the 1981 Ray Harryhausen stop-motion film [Clash of the Titans](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082186/), in the form of a four-armed version of the Creature From The Black Lagoon.

The mythological tie in for the movie is to the myth of Perseus, who rescued [Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(mythology)) from a sea monster sometime named [Cetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus_(mythology)), although in Greek Cetus is a general term that can just mean "shark" or "whale."

When that was remade in 2010 it got a particularly resonant (and shiny) Liam Neeson delivering the line which achieved a kind of sub-meme status, thus locking in the lame-ass Hollywood hack job as a historical "fact"
