Date is definitely wrong. I'd say it looks like a coin of Constantius II from the mid 4th century:

thehair fillet and pose are pretty consistent with the that date. I can't be sure about the mint mark across the bottom obverse in the photo, but you can check it here:

My guess is that it's SIR, for Sirmium -- the big military headquarters on the Danube in the 3d-5th centuries This is too obscure to bother faking but it's at least 200 years newer than you were told.

Here's a page of examples from that period that might help you sleuth it out in more detail: [Edgar L. Owen Galleries](http://www.edgarlowen.com/roman-imperial-coins-late.shtml)

__update__  . I took a closer look at the obverse again, I'm pretty sure it's FEL. TEMP. REPARATIO, short for 'The return of good times". That's almost certainly a Constantius II.
