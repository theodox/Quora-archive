As the other answers note the correct usage is _adoremus_ , it's a subjunctive . And of course the translation is the other way: the original [Adeste Fideles ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Come,_All_ye_Faithful)was written in Latin at some point in the middle ages (the date is unclear but it seems to be 13th century or later). It was translated into English in 1841. The common musical arrangement comes from the late 17th or early 18th century.
