# When the Macedonian Royal house was accepted in the fifth century BC by some as being Greek (not by all Greeks), why didn’t this apply to the rest of the Macedonian population?

There’s often nothing less representative than a royal family.

Whether it’s the Etruscan Tarquins ruling Rome, the Macedonian Ptolemies ruling Egypt, it was quite common in antiquity for ruling houses to retain a distinct degree of distance from the people they ruled. This should not come as a surprise in a world where the [Greek royal family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_royal_family) is, after all, a branch of the [House of Glücksburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Gl%C3%BCcksburg) and the Romanov’s of Russia were descended from [Charles Peter Ulrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_III_of_Russia) and his wife [Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_the_Great).



_“I'm as British as Queen Victoria!” 
“So your father's German, you're half German, and you married a German?'"_ 

While many modern royal families have reinvented themselves as nationalist icons, until the 19th century it was completely normal for royalty to have stronger connections to their social peers across the border than they did to their own subjects.

So, there’s nothing surprising about a royal family claiming — or even, under the right conditions, inventing — an origin that had nothing to do with the ethnic makeup of their domains. Certainly this pattern would not have bothered ancient Greeks, given that Thebes was supposedly founded by a Phoenician, Argos by Egyptians, and the Peloponnesus by a Phrygian. The _reality_ of those linkages is of course quite debatable: [mythical genealogies were a primary tool of ancient propaganda](https://qr.ae/pvkkgw). On the other hand, in historic times it was not uncommon for a powerful but politically exposed Greek to decamp for the hinterlands and rule like a king — Athenian politicians like Peisistatratus, Cimon, Hagnon, Thucydides, Alcibiades, and Iphicrates all set up as small-time rulers in Thrace during lulls in their careers at home. This form of adventurism was common enough that it spawned the nickname Θρᾳκοφοίτης, “Thrace-loitering.”

So, the Argead connection to be Argos _might_ be a bit of political mythmaking; equally plausibly, it _might_ an early iteration of the Athenian “raj” in sixth and fifth century Thrace.

But — to return to the question — it’s worth noting that in the Greek-speaking world, the pattern of exogenous ruling houses was particularly common in the mountainous lands north of the familiar city-state territories of central and southern Greece. Here’s the Roman era geographer Strabo talking about the tribal peoples on the far side of the Pindus mountains and up into Macedonia:

> In earlier times these peoples were ruled separately, each by its own dynasty. For instance, it was the descendants of Cadmus and Harmonia who ruled over the Enchelii; and the scenes of the stories told about them are still pointed out there. These people, I say, were not ruled by men of native stock; and the Lyncestae became subject to Arrabaeus, who was of the stock of the Bacchiads (Eurydice, the mother of Philip, Amyntas' son, was Arrabaeus' daughter's daughter and Sirra was his daughter); and again, of the Epeirotes, the Molossi became subject to Pyrrhus, the son of Neoptolemus the son of Achilles, and to his descendants, who were Thessalians. But the rest were ruled by men of native stock.

[Strabo, VII.7](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/strabo/7g*.html)

Clearly the idea of “foreign” kings was not surprising in this part of the world: these exotic fringes of the Greek world were ruled by families that claimed descent from the heroes of Greek myth and the states they ruled were heterogeneous. The royals of [Lynkestis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynkestis), who claimed descent from the Bacchiad kings of Corinth, married into the Argead dynasty in the time of Amyntas III, although Amyntas IV absorbed their state.
