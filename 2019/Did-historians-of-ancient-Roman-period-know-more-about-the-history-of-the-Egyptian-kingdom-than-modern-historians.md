No… or at least not in the material that has survived.

We do know that Roman era authors had access to sources we have lost. There were a few native Egyptian authors in the Ptolemaic period who wrote in Greek, the most famous being [Manetho](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho). We have only fragments of those works but ancient authors will have had the whole. but even in these fragments and quotations there are surprisingly few Egyptian sources. Manetho and a few other sources did provide [lists of kings](https://pharaoh.se/king-lists), sometimes with some laconic commentary — but apart from that the there was almost nothing that a modern reader would regard as “history.” The stylized, bombastic inscriptions of various mortuary temples are a gold mine of information to modern historians but there’s no evidence that Egyptians (or Greeks or Romans) every tried to use them to synthesize a coherent narrative history.

It’s important not to forget the very long period of foreign occupations between the Roman period and the real demise of Pharaonic Egypyt. Starting with the Nubian conquest in the middle of the eighth century BC, Egypt was ruled by Assyrians, Persians and eventually the Ptolemies: Egypt was under foreign control for about five and a half of the seven centuries between the arrival of the Nubians and the arrival of Julius Caesar. While Egyptian civilization was tenacious and resilient, it was dependent on the good will of foreigners for a _long_  time.

Egyptian religious institutions did reasonably well during this long period. with a few unfortunate exceptions the conquerors usually found it convenient to support the temples in return for political legitimacy and social peace. So, there was continuity of religious traditions and literacy in traditional hieroglyphic writing. On the other hand secular Egyptian high culture did not have that kind of foreign backing. If there ever was a native Egyptian historiographic tradition — of which we are far from sure — it would have been recalling glories that the various foreign regimes which ruled Egypt generally did not want remembered.

You can get some sense of how attenuated Egyptian historical memory had become by looking at the kinds of information that were (and were not) recorded by Herodotus. He visited Egypt in person and on many occasions he attributes his information to Egyptian informants. However when he addresses events more than a century or so before his own time, the information he relays is not only inaccurate but often spectacularly so, and seems to reflect a strange mix of folk traditions and tales invented to amuse credulous tourists.

Herodotus tried to get the truth from the various interpreters, guides, and priests he interviewed. However most of them do not seem to have been particularly well informed. In some cases he’s relating what seem to be basically folk tales, like the story of the [clever tomb-robber](http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh2120.htm) who outwits Rhampsinitis (Rameses II) and marries the Pharaoh’s daughter. Other times he’s working in an authentic — but inaccurate — Egyptian tradition. For example, he incorrectly believes that two of the great pyramid-builders, [Cheops ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu)and [Chephren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khafra), were brothers and that the second was the immediate successor of the first. This is wrong — the successor of Cheops was [Djedefre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djedefre) —- but the mistake appears in [Egyptian papyri almost a thousand years before Herodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westcar_Papyrus#Depictions_of_the_kings).

In short, the Egyptians of the Persian era seem to have had only a shaky grasp of their own history. Their Roman-era descendants were unlikely to be much better informed.
