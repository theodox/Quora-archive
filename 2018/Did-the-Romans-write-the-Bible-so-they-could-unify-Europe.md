Short answer: __No__ .

Slightly longer answer:

The Romans got about as far as they ever would in unifying Europe by around the year 100. There was no Latin Bible at the time — the New Testament was just starting to take shape and the only version of the Old Testament floating around at that point was [a Greek translation of the original Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint).

The [first Latin “Bible”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vetus_Latina) was a translation of that Greek one; it seems to have come together in the later third or early fourth century. The more familiar Latin Bible, the one you can still pick up on Amazon, dates from the end of the 4th century — the circumstances under which it was translated are quite well known because the author, [St. Jerome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome), was a tireless letter-writer and an active participant in a lot of noisy church controversies. Jerome lived to see the sack of time by the Goths in 410 — Rome was not in the empire-building business anymore during his lifetime.

The Greek version dates back to third century BC — well before the Romans were important outside of Italy (there were at least five other competing Greek translations in the intervening centuries too, though none survives in its entirety). The oldest surviving Hebrew texts are the [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls), some of which date back as far as 150 BC (a period when , in case you are wondering, the Romans were still bit-players in Middle Eastern politics). Elsewhere, [small Biblical fragments have been found dating back 500 before that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketef_Hinnom) — to a period when Rome was still ruled by the Etruscans.

TLDR: __no.__
