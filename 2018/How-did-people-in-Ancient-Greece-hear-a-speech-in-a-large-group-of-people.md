In some public settings, there were repeaters: people who repeated what a speaker was saying to the rest of the crowd. For example when the Roman general [Flamininus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/flamininus*.html) announced his settlement of Greek affairs after defeating Macedonia, it went like this:

> At first, then, the proclamation was by no means generally or distinctly heard, but there was a confused and tumultuous movement in the stadium of people who wondered what had been said, and asked one another questions about it, and called out to have the proclamation made again; but when silence had been restored, and the herald in tones that were louder than before and reached the ears of all, had recited the proclamation, a shout of joy arose, so incredibly loud that it reached the sea.

In many other settings there was no need â€” although at its maximum size the Athenian assembly on the [Pnyx](http://www.agathe.gr/democracy/the_ekklesia.html) could accommodate thirteen or fourteen thousand people, a more usual quorum was less than half of that (particularly during the classical period). Broadway theaters from the early 20th century could accomodate 5000 or more guests without electrical amplification, so the scale is not wildly off.

Needless to say ancient orators also practiced projection, like Broadway actors. The famous Demosthenes, for example, trained himself to deliver speeches with a mouthful of pebbles so he could exaggerate his intonations, and while jogging to improve his wind power.
