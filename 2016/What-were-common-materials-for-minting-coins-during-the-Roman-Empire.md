The usual suspects: gold, silver, and bronze formed the bulk of the currency. However the Romans also used an something they called [orichalcum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orichalcum), which might not always have been one alloy but evidently resembled brass. At some times they also used copper for the lowest denominations. Here's a sample, though it's not complete for the whole imperial period:

 Aureus = gold, 
denarius = silver, 
sestertius = brass or orichalcum (originally smaller and silver)
dupondius = brass
as = copper
semis = bronze
quadrans = copper here, usually bronze

Of all of these silver was the dominant one for transactions above the day-to-day: thats why so many modern currencies use variants of the name like _dinar_  or _denier._ Manipulating the silver content of the coins was the primary tool of what passed for macroeconomic policy in Roman times. "Good" emperors were usually ones who held the currency at a high standard of metal purity; "bad" emperors eked out the imperial budget by debasing coins with less valuable metals, which was generally regarded as a big scam by the public and which tended to set of bouts of inflation and hoarding (see [Steve Theodore's answer to How much more powerful could the Roman Empire have become with a thorough understanding of modern economics and finance?](https://www.quora.com/How-much-more-powerful-could-the-Roman-Empire-have-become-with-a-thorough-understanding-of-modern-economics-and-finance/answer/Steve-Theodore?srid=zLvM&share=c263a305) for more detail than you could possibly want).
