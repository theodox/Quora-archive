# If the Romans built a much more powerful and culturally significant empire than the Greeks, why do we refer to the pantheon of gods by their Greek names rather than their Roman ones?

Actually this is a surprisingly recent development— it corresponds broadly with the decline in the use of Latin as an international language after the 18th century.

In, say, 1700 an educated person in Europe was a expected to be pretty conversant with Latin; if you wanted to keep up with the latest on science or philosophy or law, you’d probably reading foreign authors in Latin rather than in translation (think, for example, of Linnaeus or the _Principia Mathematica)_ . As such, you’d also be quite familiar with the Olympians in their Roman forms. If you look at the handful of common expressions in English that reference the gods you note that they are all in the Roman form: “Venus smiles not in a house of tears” or “This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,” and the most common of all, “by Jove!”

However the decline of Latin as a living language put some distance in the relationship with the Roman pantheon. Romanticism in the early 19th century also included a hefty dose of Hellenism. Ironically, since this coincided with the retreat of hard-core classicism in education, many of the newly-popular Greek texts were inspiring in translation, rather than the original — here’s a snippet from a famously nasty review of Keats’ Endymion from 1818

> It is amusing to see what a hand the two Cockneys [Keats and Leigh Hunt] make of this mythology; the one confesses he has never read the Greek Tragedians, and the other knows Homer only from Chapman; and both of them write about Apollo, Pan, Nymphs, Muses, and Mysteries, as might be expected from persons of their education.

But even Keats the Hellenophile still wrote this, in _To Homer:_ 

> Standing aloof in giant ignorance,
 Of thee I hear and of the Cyclades,
As one who sits ashore and longs perchance
 To visit dolphin-coral in deep seas.
So thou wast blind;—but then the veil was rent,
 For Jove uncurtain'd Heaven to let thee live,
And Neptune made for thee a spumy tent,
 And Pan made sing for thee his forest-hive;
Aye on the shores of darkness there is light,
 And precipices show untrodden green,
There is a budding morrow in midnight,
 There is a triple sight in blindness keen;
Such seeing hadst thou, as it once befel
To Dian, Queen of Earth, and Heaven, and Hell.

It wasn’t really until the second half of the nineteenth century that the Greek names really became common currency. When every schoolboy read the Aeneid, Jove and Mars and Cupid were familiar to the point of banality. When most people no longer read the Latin classics, the Greek names were not really any more obscure. The legacy of Romanticism made them seem more raw and archaic, so that a Nietzsche or an Oscar Wilde would hark back to the untamed, scary Dionysus rather than the conventionalized, party-loving Bacchus.

And, of course, professional scholars for the last hundred and fifty years have been a lot more careful about distinguishing between the two pantheons — now that it’s all just subject matter, precision trumps familiarity.
