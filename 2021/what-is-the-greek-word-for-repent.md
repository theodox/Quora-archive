The usual Greek for “repent” is the verb [μετανοέω](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=metanoew&la=greek#lexicon). The νοέω part means “to perceive” or “to apprehend” or “to think”, and μετα here means “after” — so when I repent I literally “think again.”

In pre-New Testament Greek it can basically mean “to have second thoughts” or “to reconsider.” By the first century or so, the emphasis was definitely on the idea of not merely reconsidering, but an active change of mind or of heart. The Jewish author [Philo](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philo-Judaeus), who would have been a slightly older contemporary of Jesus, uses μετανοέω in both senses but clearly the more important meaning to him is to change one’s way of life:

> Moreover, Moses delivers to us very beautiful exhortations to repentance, by which he teaches us to alter our way of life, changing from an irregular and disorderly course into a better line of conduct
