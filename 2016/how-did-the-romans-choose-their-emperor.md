On average they chose themselves: of the roughly 90* emperors between Augustus and Romulus Augustulus, [more than half were the victors of civil wars](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires). By contrast only a handful actually inherited the throne and even fewer got anything approaching a formal approval from the Senate.

_Those 4 blue and one green bars are the ‘five good emperors’ — the longest period of peaceful succession in Roman history._ 

What we think of as “regular” hereditary succession didn’t become common until Byzantine times. Many emperors _tried_  to pass their thrones down to their children; successful examples include [Septimius Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus) and [Vespasian.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian) However the network of institutions and loyalties which sustained a hereditary monarchy in later eras didn’t really exist — or at least it wasn’t powerful enough to counterbalance the temptations of military anarchy. Young emperors like [Gordian III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_III) or [Gallienus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallienus) who inherited the throne without the backing of the army or powerful allies tended not to last very long.

When things were not completely down the tubes, the usual method resembled the way an old-line CEO would groom a successor from among his lieutenants. The most successful run of emperors, the so-called [Five Good Emperors](http://www.roman-empire.net/highpoint/highpoint.html) (Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus and Marcus Aurelius) all chose their own successors by ‘co-optation’, choosing their heirs and reigning alongside them before dying or retiring). The system was not, however, legal or formal: Marcus Aurelius, though famous for his philosophical detachment, broke with the tradition and instead of choosing an adult colleague as a successor passed the throne to his wastrel son [Commodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus), with results so bad that only [Joaquin Phoenix](https://aelarsen.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/gladiator-just-how-bad-an-emperor-was-commodus/) could play him.

In various forms co-optation was the closest thing the Romans had to an institutional succession plan. It was also the basis for the common practice of [splitting the empire between two rulers](https://www.quora.com/Which-emperor-is-credited-with-splitting-the-Roman-Empire-into-2-parts).

At the end of the chaotic, war-ridden third century [Diocletian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian) made an effort to regularize the succession. His plan created a 4-emperor system with two senior emperors (the _Augusti_ ) each with a designated successor (the _Caesari)_  . The plan was that each Augustus would co-opt his own Caesar, providing a regular succession, while the split between east and west would provide ballast to prevent more coups and assassinations.

_The two Augusti and two Caesari: Diocletians’ idea for regularizing the Roman succession._ 

Unfortunately the system didn’t really even outlast Diocletian himself, though he does go down in history as the first and arguably the only Roman emperor to retire voluntarily. Before Diocletian died, however, the old pattern reasserted itself: while he was still alive there were 4 would-be _Augusti_  and only one _Caesar,_ while most of Italy was under the control of the sone of a previous _Augustus_  who had been passed over for co-optation in a palace power struggle.

_Despite the propagandistic intent of the tetrarch relief, the fact that all four are still holding their swords in their off-hands is a revealing detail. The tetrarchy failed to curb the endemic problem of imperial succession_ 



_* The most common number quoted for Roman Emperors is 86 - but you can inflate that count quite easily by including unsuccessful would-be emperors who differ from their official counterparts mostly due to slightly longer lifespans and/or an easier time corralling a few terrified Senators into passing a decree._
