If you mean “within the old Persian empire” then there was only one.[ Cyrus the younger](http://Cyrus the Younger https://g.co/kgs/2qERPk) was a prince who rebelled against Artaxerxes II, but he lost and was never king except to his own followers. Cyrus the great was the second Cyrus who was a king of Anshan — but he founded the empire which most people think of as his “kingdom”
