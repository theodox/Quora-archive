12 rather than six, may be the notable number. 12 is easily divisible into halves, thirds, and quarters -- all of them easy to estimate by eye -- so it is a common number in many cultures for dividing groups into smaller sections (our "dozen" for example). 

Alternatively, the prevalence of 24 may be related to the fact that the books were 'numbered' with the letters of the 24-letter Greek alphabet
