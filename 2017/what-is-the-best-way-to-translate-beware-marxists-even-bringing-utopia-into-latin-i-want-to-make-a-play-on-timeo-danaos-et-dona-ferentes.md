If you want to be a bit obscure, you could try _timeo Heliopolitides et Saturnia regna referentes_ 

[Heliopolis](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0020859000001784) is pretty much the one-and-only example of an egalitarian social revolution in antiquity — [Aristonicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumenes_III), the bastard nephew of the [last king of Pergamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attalus_III), staged a revolt which promised, at least, to bring social equality and community of property. Aristonicus is often thought to be more of an opportunist than a true believer, but his philosophical adviser [Gaius Blossius](http://romanhistorybooks.typepad.com/roman_history_books_and_m/2009/03/gaius-blossius-stoic-philospher-the-gracchi.html), had earlier advised the Gracchi before their revolution came to an untimely end.

The _Saturnia regna_ , the “reigns of Saturn” is the mythical golden age of peace and plenty which preceded the flood (Virgil referred to it in [Eclogue IV](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:phi,0690,001:4), in the wake of [very different, much more “Roman” revolution](http://amzn.to/2uxEhaa): the triumph of Augustus).

The obvious downside of this version that it needs footnotes for a modern reader. A Roman would get the references, if not the joke.
