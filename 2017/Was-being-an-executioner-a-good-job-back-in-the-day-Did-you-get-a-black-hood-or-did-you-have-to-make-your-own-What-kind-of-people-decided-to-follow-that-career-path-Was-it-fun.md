Generally it was position for outcasts, but one which still involved a certain level or respect (or at least, fear). Perhaps as a result, it was often a hereditary job since few civilians were willing to undertake it. On the other hand, the job usually came with lucrative perks: in later times — for example, 18th and early 19th century England — the hangman would sell sections of the rope used to hang a particularly infamous criminal for as much as £1 an inch. The executioner usually also got to keep the clothes of the condemned — which, for richer victims, could be worth a considerable amount of money. The famous English executioner [Jack Ketch](https://londonhistorians.wordpress.com/2011/04/19/jack-ketch-bodgy-axeman/) was notorious for taking bribes to minimize the suffering of the victims, although on more than one famous occasion he botched the job in full view of a waiting crowd.

_The victim, lying down: “I am sick of a traitrous disease”
Jack Ketch, with rope: “Here’s you cure!”_ 

There’s a really good fictionalized discussion of the social life of the executioner in the [Hangman’s Daughter series](http://amzn.to/2y7v7C0) of novels by Oliver Pötzsch.
