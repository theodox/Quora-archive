Etymologically they are young men coming out of ( ἐ-) of youth (ἥβη). This is a close as you get in classical Greek to “teenagers” though that’s a misleading translation; it really means youths making the transition from boys to adult citizens. This time of the transition varied from place to place, ranging from about 16–18 years of age in different parts of the Greek world.

Depending on context, an ἔφηβος could specifically be a young man serving his military apprenticeship, or it could more broadly be any young man between about 16 and 20 years of age. When talking about ephebes as a group, it’s usually the former meaning, but it’s important to check context.

_An ephebe, identified by his chlamys and military gear._ 

In most cities of the classical and early Hellenistic period ephebes were organized into paramilitary groups. The ephebes trained to fight in the citizen militia armies of the city state, and often did light duty like border patrols. It’s often said that becoming an ephebe meant putting on the chlamys, the soldier’s cloak. At the completion of your service (two years, in the classical period) you assumed the full rights of a citizen.

Because of the military connection, the ephebate also had a class connotation. Typically the classical ephebate only included young men whose families were wealthy enough to actually form part of the citizen militia: foreigners and those too poor to meet the property qualification for service in the militia (where providing your own arms and armor was a prerequisite of service) were never ephebes. Democratic Athens was something of an exception, since the city provided the ephebes with a minimal set of equipment — a shield, a spear, a chlamys and a petasos, a sun hat — allowing many more citizens to serve as ephebes. In more aristocratic cities, though, the corps was much less broad-based.

Over the course of the Hellenistic period, citizen armies decayed, but the notional connection between military service and citizenship remained. The idea of ephebes survived in the Greek-speaking world into the later Roman empire but it morphed into a kind of ceremonial half-way house between the gymnasium and full adult citizenship with only nominal military duties. In Alexandria, for example, there were periodic complaints from the upper classes about Jews (who were not supposed to be full citizens) getting into the corps of ephebes and thus “infiltrating” the citizen body. Under the Roman empire the ephebate was little more than an upper-class boy’s club with a few special ritual duties and some attached sporting contests.

_An Athenian ephebic inscription, listing the ephebes for the year 117 AD. By this point this was mostly an aristocratic right of passage, but in earlier times this kind of list was the public record of who would become the next members of the citizen body._ 

The word ephebe also carried an erotic twinge (it still does, apparently, in the world of the google image search). Once you’d completed your service as an ephebe, you were no longer supposed to play the junior role in a paederastic relationship. An ephebe was, therefore, the popular image of the pinnacle of beautiful youth still available to adult men; ephebes (identified again by their chlamys and but also their beardlessness) were[ popular motifs on Greek paederastic pottery](https://www.quora.com/What-would-ancient-Greeks-from-the-different-cities-have-given-to-their-lovers-as-interest-gifts-or-love-tokens/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=ccf41c0a&srid=zLvM).
