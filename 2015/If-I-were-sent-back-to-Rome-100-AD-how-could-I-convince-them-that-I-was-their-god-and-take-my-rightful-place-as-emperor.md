I played as much [The Seven Cities of Gold ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Cities_of_Gold_(video_game))as the next 80's kid... more, actually... but the whole idea that walking into a backwards culture with a bunch of toys and using them to con the natives into worshipping you is (a) a historical myth and (b) racist garbage. Transposing it onto the Romans just swaps presentism for racism but it's still predicated on the notion that the people on the receiving end are just ignorant fools who can be easily deluded by their intellectual superiors. History rarely bears that out. Instead, it shows that people always, always try to turn these kind of encounters to their own advantage, whether they have the cool toys or not.

The Spaniards arrived in Mexico with ships that could circumnavigate the ocean, steel armor, horses, cannons, telescopes, astrolabes, compasses, and 4 millennia of literate culture behind them. Nahuatl had no word for "ship" or "horse", much less "cannon" or "musket" -- when they first saw cavalry they though the Spaniards were riding outsized deer. You don't see those kinds of disparities very often. And yes, a few Mexicans did try think the Spanish were divine or otherworldly -- but hell, people think that about Elvis Presley. Or, God help us, about _Justin Bieber_ . Unless you've seen Elvis in a slice of toast you probably don't think kind of gullibility describes you -- and it didn't describe most Aztecs either. When Cortez conquered Mexico he did it with guns, germs, steel -- and 200,000 Mexicans who hated the Aztecs. The rest off the neighborhood were willing to side with anybody - not matter how oddly dressed or how weird their habits -- who would help get rid of their enemies. The Tlaxcalans and may have misjudged the long-term outcome, but that hardly makes them unique in history.

If you showed up in Rome in 100 AD you would certainly make a splash. But your chances of achieving supreme power (much less divine status) are very, very low. If you were lucky, you might end up well rewarded for playing a minor part in some intra-Roman power struggle with your doodads. If you were less lucky, you'd more likely end up with your head on a pilum in the forum.

In terms of "amazing the natives", you' have an uphill battle. Plenty of Romans were religious skeptics: Cicero, one of the chief augurs (official oracles) of the state religion [wrote a book debunking the idea of omens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Divinatione) (in it he quoted an older Roman saying to the effect that it was a wonder that when one diviner saw another one in the street they didn't burst out in laughter). Most educated Romans in 100 AD would at least be familiar with [De rerum natura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_rerum_natura), the materialist manifesto by Lucretius, and pretty much any member of the ruling class would have had enough education in Greek philosophy to be a very critical audience for your wonder-working. You probably could convince a lot of Rome's equivalent to the Elvis-in-a-slice-of-toast crowd, but those weren't the people in power (and Rome in 100AD was emphatically _not_  a democracy). Most Roman emperors were officially declared gods after death ( Vespasian's last deathbed joke was "dear me, I'm afraid I'm becoming a god.") but this was generally regarded as a polite fiction. The [Apocolocyntosis](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10001/10001-h/10001-h.htm) of Seneca is a good example of how little serious belief was invested in the idea.

So, when you show up with your impressive gadgetry there will be plenty of people in the audience who'll be watching you very closely to see how it works. It will be like doing a magic show for a room full of Penns and Tellers. They are much more likely to be thinking "what could I do with that little glowing box if I killed this guy and took it" than "he must be a god!"

Without the aura of divinity, you're just a lone individual with no friends in a country ruled by sharks. In 100 AD you'd be dealing with the extremely competent Trajan (my [#2 pick for greatest Roman Emperor](http://www.quora.com/Who-was-the-greatest-Roman-Emperor/answer/Steve-Theodore?srid=zLvM&share=1))

_You are not likely to out-badass Trajan_ 

Trajan was the first non-Roman Roman emperor -- a good indicator of both ambition and competence. He was also a hard, hard man: he was placed on the throne by the Praetorian guards; and when the ringleaders of the coup came to collect their rewards he had their heads chopped off (opinion is divided as to whether that was outraged patriotism or if he was silencing his co-conspirators. Neither option really bodes will for your project).

If you showed up and tried to pose as the founder of a new, non-Roman creed -- well, you might want talk to the survivors of the [Kitos War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War), where Trajan more or less exterminated the Jewish communities everywhere from Libya to Iraq. He wasn't exactly open to alternative claims of divine sanction, and he was not somebody you want to cross. I'm pretty certain when you did your sound-and-light show for Trajan he'd be watching pretty carefully to see how your projector and loudspeakers were connected to your generator, and calculating how he could use the same tricks on the Parthians.

Of course, you could try the brute force approach. You can see how completely that has worked in, say, Afghanistan or Cambodia or Nebraska. Somehow the natives just don't seem to stay impressed for long; and they turn out to be pretty good at figuring out complex technological marvels like... triggers.

If you show up with a cartload of AK-47's -- well, you'll get a lot of attention for sure. But it's highly unlikely that the professional soldiers on the other side will fail to notice that your equipment has to be operated by plain vanilla human beings who can be stabbed, sliced or poisoned like anybody else.

Modern weapons would definitely make you a power in the land. As long as you were useful, you'd be important: if you could provide a service that nobody else could you'd be relatively safe: but you'd also be high value target to the other side in whatever murky Roman politics you found yourself involved in. However, given[ the well-known willingness of Roman armies to engage in coups](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires), I would not bet on you outliving the time it took a few centurions to figure out how to field strip and reassemble an AK. Ironically most of the more impressive pieces of military tech would really do you little good: an anti-tank missile launcher is not much use in a world without tanks; an attack helicopter needs many hours of maintenance for a single hour in the air. And the bigger your support crew, the harder it would be to maintain any illusion of divinity: one of your garage mechanics is going to get drunk in a Roman bar and blab your secrets.

Or you might just cut yourself shaving, like [The Man Who Would Be King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Would_Be_King)
