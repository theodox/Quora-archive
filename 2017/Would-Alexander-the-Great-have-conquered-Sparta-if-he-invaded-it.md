The Spartans were beaten badly by Alexander’s lieutenant Antipater at the [battle of Megalopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Megalopolis) in 331 BC. It was widely expected that Alexander would order the helpless city destroyed, as he had already done to Thebes four years earlier. Alexander, however, allowed Sparta to live in memory of her past glories. However Megalopolis was really the last stand of the old Spartan military.

By this point the true Spartans — the members of the Spartan famous military elite — were already so few in number that the city could not field a formidable army without a lot of mercenaries. The serious losses that Sparta suffered at Megalopolis crippled the already wounded Spartan class system. Within a century Sparta’s distinctive way of life had decayed beyond recognition: the descendants of the original Spartan military caste had been reduced to 700 households. King [Agis IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agis_IV) tried to re-institute the classical Spartan way of life but was murdered for his troubles in 245 BC.
