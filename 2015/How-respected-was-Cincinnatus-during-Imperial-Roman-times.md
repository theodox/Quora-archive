The Republican Roman code was, fundamentally, the code of a bunch of competitive aristocrats; a lot of what was drummed into young Romans of the upper classes (the one whom we know the most about, since their class sponsored or produced the literary sources we depend on) was the code of honor which regulated aristocratic competition.

Cincinnatus was a folk hero because he modeled a key principle of that code: he did his job, received the accolades of the people, and then gracefully retired to private life: he was a _good sport_  in the grand aristocratic game of competition for power and influence. Marius, Sulla, Pompey, Caesar and the other would-be dynasts were of course _bad sports_ : they took their balls home with them when the game didn't go their way. But during the heyday of the republic the regular rotation of power was a point of pride for the aristocracy, a key way of proving that they had earned their distinction by submission to the law as well as by administering it. Before the monarchy the proudest boast of the Roman ruling class was _lex rex,_ "law alone is king".

After the rise of Augustus, many aspects of Roman tradition gradually moved from being guiding social principles to being essentially nostalgic values. Ironically it was [Livy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livy) -- a friend and supporter of Augustus -- who really crystallized the literary tradition of Republican virtues at the same time as his patron was creating a monarchy, which illustrates how complex the realities were. Many members of the upper classes clung to the Republican ideals even when they were no longer politically relevant: Rare statesmen like [Helvidius Priscus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvidius_Priscus) or authors like [Tacitus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus) show Republicanism living on in ghostly form after end of Roman liberty. Not by accident, Tacitus is a great source for spicy stories of imperial misbehavior. Moreover — _it's complex!_ — Tacitus relied heavily on the history written by [Emperor Claudius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius), himself a closeted Republican if tradition is to be believed.

In the provinces, traditional gentry often found that older aristocratic code more compelling than stylized emperor worship. It took a couple of centuries for the elimination of aristocratic rule at Rome itself to really undermine the traditional aristocratic monopoly on power elsewhere. Local elites looked at the successful run enjoyed by the Roman aristocracy and could not help but find it appealing, even if it was a dwindling reality in the Rome of their own day. Thus, even a Greek author like [Plutarch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch) admires the code of the old republic as a model of aristocratic discipline (it’s telling that he has an equally nostalgic appreciation for ancient Sparta). Among people like these, the story of Cincinnatus would be an honored example of the old, and sadly abandoned, Roman way.

In other circles, of course, admiration for a figure like Cincinnatus would be.... problematic. Citing Cincinnatus in front of an emperor whose title originated with Caesar, the "Dictator for life," can easily be construed as criticism; if you were living under one of the touchier emperors — [Domitian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domitian), for example — you would only try that if you were either very brave or not very bright. In an era in which political speech was highly curtailed, historical allusions could be very dangerous: Domitian had people put to death for overly pointed mythological poems, so it's easy to see how praise of Republican restraint would be rewarded.

Domitian was, however, something of an exception in the early empire. The facade of Republican continuity lasted, with different degrees of seriousness and conviction, until the 3d century. That superficial continuity ensured that the literary and traditional sources of the Cincinnatus story would not completely forgotten; we know for example that Cincinnatus figured in the work of [Cassius Dio](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/6*.html), during the 3d century, so the tradition was not lost completely.

However, the class which had supported the old values had been decimated by the wars that ended the Republic and the proscriptions of the early Empire. The nobility of the later empire hardly ever descended from the great names of the Republican era. Dio himself was a Greek, writing in Greek; Tacitus came from a much less distinguished family. Without that bedrock of support, the old Republican ethos gradually faded from view. The chaos of the 3d century makes it hard to know much about political and social attitudes, and of course in that period of military dictatorships and civil wars the Republican model was essentially irrelevant whether one thought of it with longing or not.

By the time stability was restored by Diocletian, Rome had been an absolute monarchy for three hundred years. The nuances of Republican virtue had been largely forgotten except by antiquarians, and they would not really re-emerge until the Renaissance. Livy's prose style and anecdotes found a ready audience in the city states of Italy, where a new competitive aristocracy contented for honor and power and tried — with markedly mixed success — to emulate the Romans’ regular, peaceful handovers of power. The story became famous again in the 16th century, perhaps most famously through the work of Machiavelli… another closet Republican in the service of a despot. It would have a third, and most influential life in the 18th century when it animated another set of public-spirited gentlemen in their struggle against absolute monarchism. It was a popular story in both early America and republican France (where, interestingly, it ran yet again into the case of “don’t quote this story in front of the ‘dictator for life’”) .
