The Republic was highly suspicious of individual power.

There were basically no individual offices - everything from the management of the local water system to the defense of the empire was m by groups of magistrates rather than individuals; that’s why so many Roman offices are things like _decemviri, “_ the board of ten” or _septemviri_ , “the board of seven”.

Avoiding concentration of power in the hands of one person served several needs. The most important — at least in theory — was to offer protection against tyranny: no officer would have the enough power to subvert the Republic “Tyranny” here has two meanings, which were both important to the political class in Rome. There’s our meaning — arbitrary rule by one person — but in Latin and Greek “tyrant” specifically means “a renegade aristocrat who organizes the masses against the elites,” something which worried the senators at least as much as arbitrary power in the abstract.

Less obvious, but maybe more important, plural offices were a safety valve for the competitive-instincts of Rome’s politicians. More office holders meant more chances for a young aristocrat to land a job and jump start his career; more windows for cutting deals and rewarding followers; and more opportunities for profit. Given the sometimes cutthroat nature of political competition in Rome the extra offices provided more breathing room.

The system of plural officers had one obvious drawback — it produced a lot of friction. Roman history is littered with examples of working at cross purposes, obstructing each other, or even resorting to blows. On occasion this could produce a catastrophe— the destruction of the Roman army at [Cannae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cannae), for example, stemmed in part from the eagerness of one consul to outdo his colleague; the disaster at the [Arausio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Arausio) was another case of quarreling officers though that time one was a proxy for the second consul.

The famous office of Dictator was an improvisation designed to make sure that there was a unified command in a crisis. But one of the reasons they [loved stories about Dictators past who voluntarily laid down their power](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-Roman-thing-ever) when the hour of peril was over was a deeply-felt need to reassert the normal order of plural magistracies. Even Dictators had somebody to keep an eye on them: the Roman defeat at [Geronium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Geronium) happened because the “Master of Horse”, the Dictator’s second in command, was chosen as a political counterweight to the actual Dictator and refused to cooperate with him on the field.

There was three intervals when the Romans experimented with a different number of executive officers. Between 444 and 436 BC they tried a three-man board called the [Tribuni militum consulari potestate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribuni_militum_consulari_potestate), “military tribunes with the powers of consuls”. This experiment was repeated in the 420’s and teens with four members, and then from 404 to the 370’s with six. Unfortunately we know very little about this office, how it functioned and why it was created — our best guess, looking at the dates, is that it was an effort to find a compromise position that satisfied the plebeians without actually allowing plebeians to serve as consuls though it’s also possible that it was a reflection of military needs (the name suggests as much). However by the mid 360’s the office fell out of use and was never revived: the _[Lex Licinia Sextia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Licinia_Sextia)_ __ of 366 opened the consulate to plebeians once and for all.

On the whole, despite obvious inconveniences, the system seemed to suit Roman tastes well. It really took a hundred years to finally accept the idea of a single ruler as natural. Even then the civil government still tended to stay with the familiar “boards” for another two or three centuries.
