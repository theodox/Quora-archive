Unlike most of his contemporaries, Fabius had a pretty clear-eyed view of Hannibal. He was smart enough to avoid the jingoism of several of his fellow Roman generals, who were convinced that Hannibal could be given a good Roman thrashing if only somebody would apply the proper old-fashioned elbow grease; but he was also able to see that Hannibal was a just a talented general with a set of strengths and weaknesses, not some kind of force of nature.

On the tactical level, Hannibal had two very significant advantages in the early years of the war. His excellent cavalry gave him top-notch reconnaissance — it’s quite remarkable how many of his signal victories ([Trasimene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Trasimene) and [Geronium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Geronium#Battle_of_Geronium) in particular) were _ambushes_ , even though he was operating on the enemy’s home turf. This was a perfect complement to his gift for _[coup d'œil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d%27%C5%93il)_ , sizing up the lay of a battlefield at a glance. His masterpiece at [Cannae ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cannae)stemmed from his choice venue: a field where his outnumbered troops could maximize their strengths by drawing the Romans into one of the deadliest traps in military history.

Fabius’ famous caution was the antidote to both of Hannibal’s strengths. Unburdened by conventional Roman machismo, Fabius simply didn’t fall for the many traps which Hannibal laid before him. He never committed himself to the kind of unimaginative frontal attacks which destroyed so many of his Roman colleagues. His methodical pace and well-chosen encampments reduced Hannibal’s excellent cavalry to an annoyance: the Numidians were excellent horsemen, but, lacking stirrups and heavy lances they weren’t capable of overrunning well formed infantry. Ancient horsemen were always most dangerous to a fleeing or distracted enemy — and Fabius never showed them his back.

But ultimately, the essence of the conflict was that Hannibal was a master _tactician_ , while Fabius was a great _strategist._  He knew that Hannibal’s hold on Italy only extended for a couple of days march around his army. While the Carthaginian was incredibly dangerous in the open field he could not win the war without Roman blunders: despite his wonder-working reputation, it’s worth pointing out that Hannibal only won a handful of battles as the _attacker._  Hannibal could and did routinely outfight the Romans who tried to bring him to bay, but he was far less of a threat on offense. Operating deep in enemy territory Hannibal was always one bad day away from losing the war. Fabius’ genius was to recognize that fact and to avoid the temptations which laid so many of his more vainglorious colleagues low.

The best example of Fabius’ talent for patience came at Geronium in 217. Fabius was saddled with a hotheaded junior colleague — [Marcus Minucius Rufus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Minucius_Rufus) a politically popular and aggressive commander who had actively worked to undermine the cautious Fabian strategy both in the forum and on campaign. While Fabius was away in Rome, Minucius (very much as Fabius had feared) was easily led into another of Hannibal’s traps. Here’s [Livy’s version](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy22.html):

> Nothing that was going on amongst his enemies escaped the observation of Hannibal, for ample information was supplied to him by deserters as well as by his scouts. He was doubly delighted, for he felt sure of entrapping by his own peculiar methods the wild rashness of Minucius

Fabius, camped separately from his incautious colleague, was already prepared for the inevitable. When Hannibal sprang his trap, Minucius’ army quickly collapsed.

> Fabius' attention was first drawn to the cries of alarm, then he observed in the distance the disordered and broken ranks. "Just so," he exclaimed, "Fortune has overtaken his rashness, but not more quickly than I feared. Fabius is his equal in command, but he has found out that Hannibal is his superior both in ability and in success. However… this is not the time for censure or rebuke, advance into the field! Let us wrest victory from the foe, and a confession of error from our fellow-citizens." By this time the rout had spread over a large part of the field, some were killed, others looking round for the means of escape, when suddenly the army of Fabius appeared as though sent down from heaven to their rescue. Before they came within range of their missiles, before they could exchange blows, they checked their comrades in their wild flight and the enemy in their fierce attack. Those who had been scattered hither and thither after their ranks were broken, closed in from all sides and reformed their line; those who had kept together in their retreat wheeled round to face the enemy, and, forming square, at one moment slowly retired, and at another shoulder to shoulder stood their ground. The defeated troops and those who were fresh on the field had now practically become one line, and they were commencing an advance on the enemy when the Carthaginian sounded the retreat, showing clearly that whilst Minucius had been defeated by him he was himself vanquished by Fabius.

Here Fabius’ prudence and resolution were more important than battlefield dash.

Unfortunately for Rome the same political forces which had given an army to the intemperate Minucius elected [Gaius Terentius Varro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Terentius_Varro) to the consulship in the next year, which led directly to the catastrophe of Cannae. Once again it was Fabius’ unflappability which saved the day. He held no state office (the dictatorship was limited to a single year) but his personal prestige was the main bulwark of the Roman state in the aftermath of the disaster. He organized improvised defense of the city and provided an air of reassurance to the terrified populace by force of personality alone. [As Plutarch put it:](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Fabius_Maximus*.html)

> In him, therefore, Rome at once placed her last hopes; to his wisdom she fled for refuge as to the temple and altar, believing that it was first and chiefly due to his prudence that she still remained a city, and was not utterly broken up, as in the troublous times of the Gallic invasion. For he who, in times of apparent security, appeared cautious and irresolute, then, when all were plunged in boundless grief and helpless confusion, was the only man to walk the city with calm step, composed countenance, and gracious address, checking effeminate lamentation, and preventing those from assembling together who were eager to make public their common complaints. He persuaded the senate to convene, heartened up the magistrates, and was himself the strength and power of every magistracy, since all looked to him for guidance.

Fortunately for the Romans, Hannibal[ didn’t seize his chance](https://www.quora.com/What-actual-evidence-is-there-beyond-agreed-upon-historical-conjecture-that-Hannibal-did-not-want-to-sack-Rome/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=04583b07&srid=zLvM) and the Romans had time to regroup, now holding firmly to Fabius’ cautious if less than heroic approach. Hannibal would never repeat his battlefield miracles, now that the Romans were committed to a deliberate strategy.

Fabius never beat Hannibal in the open field; his greatest offensive success was the [capture of Tarentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tarentum_(209_BC)) in 209. He did, however, manage to keep Rome’s fragile system of alliances alive with a mixture of diplomacy and threats during the five long years after Cannae, when it looked like the entire Roman system could unravel at any moment. Once again, his genius was not in racking up body counts but in seeing the larger picture — that it was Rome’s network of client states, and not the temporary possession of this or that battlefield which really mattered.

_A Latin inscription, ca 208 BC, detailing Fabius’ career. In part it reads “when Dictator, being coequal with Minucius, he rescued the defeated and was hailed as ‘Father’ by the Minucius’ army” and “He was regarded as the most cautious commander of his age, and the most expert in military affairs”_
