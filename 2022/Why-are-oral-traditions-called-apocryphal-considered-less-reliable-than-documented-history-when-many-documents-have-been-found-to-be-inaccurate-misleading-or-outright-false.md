# Why are oral traditions (called apocryphal) considered less reliable than documented history when many documents have been found to be inaccurate, misleading, or outright false?

Oral traditions are just as likely to be inaccurate, misleading, or false as written documents. But — unlike written sources — they don’t come with any checks and balances: you can’t audit an oral tradition.

Say two rival groups produce contradictory claims about something in the past. On paper, we can at least dig around the archives and look for the paper trail, which can be very revealing. With written material, we can ask questions like:

How distant in time are the accounts from the events they purport to describe?

Did side A and side B both start making claims at the same time, or did the first mention of side B’s version show up much later — say, 500 years later, right about the time that A and B were on the brink of war?

Does one version or the other include information that clearly contradicts its implicit date, like a Roman author talking about Mexico?

Can we spot instances of plagiarism from other sources?

Is one version very commonly cited in other texts, while the other is obscure? This lets us track the relative influence of the two accounts over time.

With oral traditions, on the other hand, our ability to do these kinds of critical analyses only extends as far as the first recorded version. And for the most societies that depend on oral transmission for important things offer us a narrower range of archaeological checks and balances too: to some small degree we can compare what an ancient historian tells us about the prosperity or organization of a vanished city with things like tax records or tombstones or personal letters. A society dependent on oral tradition is not going to generate those less ideological pieces of evidence.

We can certainly do _some_ rudimentary diligence. We can track a living tradition over a few generations and observer how it changes to get an estimate of the rate of change in a particular community’s self-presentation over time. We compare regional or individual variations in different retellings, for example, to see if there’s a “family tree” of variants which might help us spot the oldest form. We look for the preservation of older vocabulary and grammatical forms as a clue to the age of a composition.

Above all, we can study how each particular tradition is transmitted:

Is this recitation the responsibility of a specialist group that has techniques for training and quality control — and if so, who supports that group and what to they expect in return?

Alternately, is it more of a flexible expression of a community’s point of view at one point in time? Does it reflect fashions and entertainment priorities?

Is it a ritual text that tries to preserve words and phrases perfectly even when they have lost their ordinary meanings, and if so, is it accompanied by a body of interpretation and commentary?

What we can’t do, however, is simply accept an oral tradition as an transparent re-transmission of information over long periods of time. There are far too many examples of the way stories mutate and grow over time to assume that any particular instance happens to be one of the very rare ones that begin to approximate the durability and — more importantly — the _testability_  of text.

Oral traditions should not be despised. For nonliterate societies they are typically a serious cultural endeavor that attracts a huge range of dedication and skill. But, respect for that effort can’t equate to uncritical acceptance of the product, which has to fight the battle against entropy and forgetfulness with inadequate weapons. Written traditions are dodgy enough, and it is the business of interrogating them keeps historians cranking out the monographs; oral traditions include all the same opportunities for obfuscation, confusion, and dishonesty with addition of a very fallible human recording mechanism.
