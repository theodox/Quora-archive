# Did Socrates exist? Do we have any evidence outside of Plato that Socrates existed? Is it at all possible that Socrates was a literary construct?

Socrates is historic. He shows up in a couple of contemporary authors.

The most important direct witness is the historian Xenophon, who wrote an account of Socrates trial and his defense which is rather different than Plato’s. [The Apology, by Xenophon](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1171/1171-h/1171-h.htm)

Secondly there’s the comic poet Aristophanes, who placed a not-very-recognizable caricature of Socrates in his play [The Clouds](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristophanes/clouds.html). Socrates was evidently well-enough known in Athens that other Athenian comedies also made fun of him: there are fragmentary references in the plays of [Ameipsas and Eupolis](https://sententiaeantiquae.com/2015/07/09/ameipsias-fr-7-diogenes-laertius-2-27-28/) too.

One of his later biographers claims to have seen the text of the indictment which led to his trial and execution about 500 years after his lifetime.
