The famous example is [opus caementicium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_concrete), known to us as [Portland cement](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Portland_cement). This fell out of use in western europe sometime after the 5th century, partly due to the lack of large scale building projects and partly due to loss of access to the kinds of volcanic ash needed to make good waterproof concrete. Medieval builders used less sophisticated slow setting mortars. The roman materials were revived in Italy the late middle ages, but a fully waterproof cement of Roman quality wasn't reproduced until the 1700's.
