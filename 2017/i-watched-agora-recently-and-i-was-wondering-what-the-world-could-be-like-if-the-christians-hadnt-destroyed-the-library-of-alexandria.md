# I watched Agora recently, and I was wondering what the world could be like if the Christians hadn’t destroyed the library of Alexandria?

It would be _remarkably similar_ , since the Library was[ destroyed by Julius Caesar’s troops ](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-responsible-for-the-destruction-of-the-library-of-Alexandria)(accidentally, at least if the Roman sources are to be believed) in 47 BC.

In any case, frequently repeated assertion belief that the library was some kind of ancient technology powerhouse is quite untrue. One — only — of the known Librarians ([Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes)) was a noted mathematician and astronomer, but all of the other known ones were grammarians and literary critics ([Zenodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenodotus), [Callimachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callimachus), [Apollonius of Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Rhodes), to name a few). The library’s real specialty was literary, not scientific — rare editions of Homer, Athenian drama, and Hellenistic poetry. The library really did do pioneering work in the preservation and critical recopying of ancient texts — the whole reason we have such a great view of life in 5th century BC Athens is because of the preservation and editing done in 3d century BC Alexandria. But the the library was not a “scientific” institution.
