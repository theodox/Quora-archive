Sometimes, but nowadays it is rare because there are so many small games out there. CounterStrike and Portal are famous examples of small games (the first by modders, the second by students) that were bought by a big company (Valve) and turned into commercial successes. 

However, with the huge volume of games available on Steam and the various app stores, and the much wider diffusion of game tech, those kinds of Cinderella stories are rarer. It's harder to spot a sleeper hit among the tens of thousands of small games out there (and, I suspect, real originality is rarer too since there is so much material to borrow from nowadays).
