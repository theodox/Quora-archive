Essentially, high imperial Rome was an aberration — an artificial growth which could only exist because the power of the Roman state enabled it. The late-Roman world was an overall period of population loss, as both climate change and significant plagues affected demographics all over Europe. However Rome’s downfall was ultimately political.

Rome was a city of over a million people in a world where the British Isles combined had barely that number. A vast annual effort was necessary to feed the city’s enormous population: probably ten million bushels of wheat were shipped to Rome every year just to handle the public grain dole, and that was not even the majority of the city’s food supply. The water systems on which the city depended were equally gargantuan undertakings: in the high imperial period, building a single kilometer of aqueduct might cost two and a half million sesterces — equivalent to five million loaves of bread. In a world where a wealthy provincial capital might hope to have 100,000 people, Rome’s incredible bulk was only possible due to the profits of empire and the political will of the state.

As a political creation, Rome was vulnerable to political shifts.

During the civil wars and foreign invasions of the third century, few emperors actually resided in Rome: they were off campaigning (often, against other would-be emperors). Diocletian, who did more than anyone to impose order at the end of the third century, may only have visited the city once — if at all. More importantly, in the year 330 Constantine moved his headquarters and court to Byzantion in Thrace — now renamed [Constantinople](http://Ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople). To support his new foundation he diverted a good deal of the Egyptian grain supply, and of course he also began a lavish building and fortification program: much of the imperial energy that once supported the city of Rome was now bestowed upon Constantinople. Rome would never again be the practical center of the Roman empire: when the empire was under the rule of one leader, he would be in Constantinople; when there were two co-emperors, the western court was typically stationed in Milan, Ravenna or even at Arles in France.

Even so, the vast size of the city and its accumulated wealth made it a magnet, so decline was not stark. However the city’s diminished importance rendered it vulnerable. When [a Gothic army laid siege to Rome first in 408 and again in 410](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging), the defense was almost laughable: the largest Roman field force that opposed the Goths was a mere 6,000 men — the size of a single legion in Caesar’s day.

The sack of 410 began to bleed population from Rome. Slaves (many of them ethnically akin to the beseigers) went over to the Goths or simply ran away. The urban poor, who were dependent on the government for subsistence, fled to find shelter. Many of the nobility decided that life on a country estate (with food of one’s own ready at hand) was preferable to a life in the city — part of the de-urbanization which affected western Europe for the next five hundred years.

The city was hardly deserted, but the population loss was symbolic of a loss of confidence in the artificial life-support on which Rome depended. The lack of confidence was entirely justified, because in 435 a far greater disaster struck: [the Vandals captured the vital grain-lands of North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandal_Kingdom), allowing them to strangle the city at will. The Vandals [also sacked Rome, in 455](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(455)) — but the real damage was economic and not military: without the vital North African grain Rome’s size was unsustainable and the western empire’s entire economy was in ruins.

The city was still, by contemporary standards, enormous: but after the Vandal sack it was on an accelerating downward trajectory. There was also worse to come.

The western empire lapsed in 476, and the rule of Italy passed into the hands of Ostrogothic kings. However the eastern empire saw a resurgence under [Justinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I), who dreamed of reuniting the Roman world. In 533 he defeated the Vandals and brought North Africa back into Roman hands — and [in 535 he invaded Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_War_(535%E2%80%93554)). His brilliant general Belisarius captured he city in 536 — but alas, this was not the dawn of a better era. The Gothic War would drag on in fits and starts until 552, and the city of Rome would change hands four more times, enduring long sieges, starvation, the sabotage of the aqueducts, and pillage. At the end of the war the population was probably only 30,000 people and the city was a shell of its former glory. The population would not recover to its imperial peak until the nineteenth century.
