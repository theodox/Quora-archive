It depends on who and where you asked. It would also depend on _when_ , since the Roman empire was a confusing mishmash of conflicting calendars which didn’t agree on much, particularly not on the actual start of the year.

The main takeaway you’d get from doing such a survey is that there’s not one answer — there are a lot and they don’t all agree. Most of your interview subjects would not understand why you might expect years to be numbered serially.

Older people would probably have told you who the consuls for the year were. For most of earlier Roman history, that was the date that mattered. Since the end of the Republic and the rise of the empire, that tradition was beginning to decay — consuls were no longer elected annually but instead appointed by the emperors, sometimes for a few months or even a few weeks at a time. The first two appointments of the year still gave their names to the year; in 30 that would have been __the consulate of__ __[Lucius Cassius Longinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cassius_Longinus_(consul_AD_30))__ __and__ __[Marcus Vinicius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Vinicius_(consul_30))__ . So, your older Romans would have said it was the consulate of Cassius Longinus and Vinicius (even though both had been replaced by mid-summer).

In 30, the habit of dating things by the emperor’s regnal year was just starting to become common. A bureaucrat, or somebody who dealt with empire-wide concerns on a regular basis (say, a military officer or a ship captain) would probably tell you it was the __16th year of emperor Tiberius__ . This habit was more widespread in the Latin-speaking provinces than in Rome proper — the spread of the imperial cult gave emperors rather more prominence outside of Italy than within it, although you could find examples everywhere. On the other hand provincials would be equally likely to give you a date based on the coming and goings of Roman governors — the emperor was a long way off and the governor was very much present. At least, the [Year of the Four Emperors ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Four_Emperors)was still in the future.

Regnal years would become the main system until Diocletian reformed the calendar again in 284. His calendar became the basis of serially-numbered era for bureaucrats (though it didn’t have broad use by civilians) until the Byzantine era. In Egypt — famously, the most bureaucratic province of the empire — Diocletian’s calendar was adopted by the young Coptic church, who still use it today. Diocletian was an enthusiastic persecutor of Christians, so the Copts call their system the __[Era of Martyrs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Martyrs)__ . This was, of course, far in the future in 30.

A historian or a antiquarian might tell you it was the __783rd year since the founding of Rome,__  what Latinists call [ab urbe condita ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_urbe_condita)dating. This was not a very common system, however, and was mostly of interest to people who wanted to try to synchronize the many messy local calendars of the Mediterranean world.

Which goes back to the “where” — if you were in the Greek-speaking provinces of the empire you would probably get a very different answer every hundred miles or so. Every city-state had once maintained its own calendar, usually dated like the Roman one by the names of annually elected magistrates . These calendars rarely agreed with each other, and although Julius Caesar had reformed the Roman calendar 75 years earlier the Roman solar year had not yet become dominant so there was plenty of room for confusion. Plus, at this point the Julian calendar was still recovering from some problems created by Caesar’s assassination, which ended up adding several extra leap -days. Augustus had fixed it all up eventually, but the advantages of the Roman system were not yet so obvious as to compel widespread adoption.

To get around that confusion, an educated Greek would probably tell you it was the __first or second year of the 202d__ __[Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad)__ __.__  Olympiads were a four-year cycle (starting in our 776 BC) and were a useful common reference point for managing the welter of local calendars. However, like the _ab urbe condita_ system it was mostly of interest to historians.

However there were still _other_  systems.

Parts of the Roman east still used the [Seleucid era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_era), or _anno graecorum,_ which dated to our 311 BC when Seleucus I recaptured Babylon. Although the Seleucid empire was, by this point, long gone the system remained in use (indeed, all the way up until the Arab conquest of Persia) because it was founded on high-quality Babylonian astronomy and was even more accurate than the Julian calendar. This was actually the only serial-number dating system in widespread use, although it was not common west of Syria. Our year 30 would have been ___anno graecorum___ __341.__ 

In Egypt the ancient Egyptian calendar, which was also a 365 day solar calendar like Caesars. In fact emperor Augustus had reformed the Egyptian calendar about 50 years prior so that it lined up better with the Julian one… except that leap years and the beginning and end of the year were calculated differently. In later years Egypt would use a 15-year cycle known as the [Indiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiction) — a sort of long tax-year that was so beloved of bureaucrats that it would continue to be used in medieval Europe and Byzantium long after Egypt had adopted the Islamic calendar. However in 30 that development was yet to come. Egyptians would have told you it was the __year 16 of the divine Tiberius.__ 

A Jew would probably have given you the date in the local secular calendar, most likely the emperor’s year in Judea proper but the Seleucid era in Mesopotamia. The Jewish lunar calendar was in use, but the modern Jewish system tying it back to the biblical creation (the ___[anno mundi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Mundi)___  date, in Latin) would not be devised for several centuries yet. The Seleucid reckoning actually makes a cameo appearance in the Bible, in the first book of Maccabees, although that was long past in 30.
