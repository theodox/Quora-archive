This kind of atrocity was standard practice for the Assyrians (the [battle of Lachish](http://www.ancient-origins.net/history-important-events/siege-lachish-history-both-victors-and-defeated-004554) was an Assyrian, not a Babylonian victory).

They were fond of grisly public executions as a form of_propaganda_ . Impalement is a very visible method of killing; like crucifixion the suffering of the victims and their remains are visible to all — a gruesome sight that any viewers will be sure to remember and re-tell to others.

_This_ _[Assyrian relief from the palace of Sennacherib](http://etc.ancient.eu/photos/siege-lachish-reliefs-british-museum/)_ _records an impalement, probably that of the battle of Lachish_ 

In a world without newspapers or television this was an efficient means of spreading the message _resistance is futile_ . Assyrian policy was the embodiment of _[schrecklichkeit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrecklichkeit)_ , or “state terror”. The practice is more common than one would like to admit — even in the early 19th century, [the bodies of captured pirates were exposed on gibbets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbeting) in many ports as a warning to potential imitators. The kings deliberately exaggerated their own cruelty as a way of intimidating possible enemies. For example [Ashurnasirpal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashurnasirpal_II) wrote

> “I flayed as many nobles as had rebelled against me [and] draped their skins over the pile [of corpses]; some I spread out within the pile, some I erected on stakes upon the pile ... I flayed many right through my land [and] draped their skins over the walls.”

And even the bookish [Ashurbanipal](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-the-first-archaeologist):

> Their dismembered bodies I fed to the dogs, swine, wolves, and eagles, to the birds of heaven and the fish in the deep…. What was left of the feast of the dogs and swine, of their members which blocked the streets and filled the squares, I ordered them to remove from Babylon, Kutha and Sippar, and to cast them upon heaps.

Modern scholars debate how many of these stories are literally true — mostly, I suspect, because it’s hard to think you’ve dedicated your scholarly career to a bunch of bloodthirsty psychopaths. However there’s no doubt that the Assyrians _wanted_  people to believe these stories, because they thought it helped keep the empire in line.
