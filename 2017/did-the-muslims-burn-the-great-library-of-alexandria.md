No, on a couple of counts.

The most important iteration of the library, the one that attracted the admiration of the ancient world, was[ destroyed seven centuries earlier when Julius Caesar’s troops accidentally set fire to the Royal Quarter of Alexandria during the Roman takeover of Egypt](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-responsible-for-the-destruction-of-the-library-of-Alexandria). There was some kind of revival under the early Roman emperors, but the institution effectively disappears from the historical record between 47 BC and 278 AD, when the entire quarter of the city where it had once stood was destroyed in fighting between the Romans and the empire of Palmyra.

The ancecdote that is usually told about the destruction of the library by Caliph Umar is that the Christian scholar John Philoponus asked the Caliph to spare the contents of the city’s public libraries, but the Caliph retorted that the books which contradicted the Quran were false, and should be destroyed, while those which did not contradict it were superfluous and thus also should be destroyed. The problem with this anecdote is that Philoponus was born in the 490’s, and the Caliph captured Alexandria in 641.
