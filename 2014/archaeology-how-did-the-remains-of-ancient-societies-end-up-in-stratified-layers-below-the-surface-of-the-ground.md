It's not always the same process everywhere. 

Some kinds of structures - adobe and mud brick in particular, like most of Mesopotamia - are easier to just re-grade than to fix: it was very common there to just knock down a failing structure, spread it out, and rebuild a new on on top ( I think this is still done in poorer areas in the region today). Wood buildings, of course, are very short lived if they are not actively maintained and repaired. Even masonry construction can have similar issues: much of a building's structure may less durable materials like wood, plaster, or wattle which can be damaged or destroyed by weather, fires, and so on, not to mention violent destruction.

Also, many ruins are not immediately rebuilt. Over long time periods cities experience cycles of growth and decay: between wars, plagues, economic and political shifts it's very common for urban areas to be left essentially abandoned. Rome, for example, had an (estimated) population over 1,000,000 in AD 100 but only 100,000 (!) in AD 1600. This meant that huge areas of the city were basically abandoned; the useful stuff (quality masonry & metal) were scavenged and the rest allowed to fall apart. 

It doesn't take too long for grass and underbrush to reconquer an un-maintained site (just look at the fate of barns and sheds in modern rural areas). Eventually the wood, plaster and organic material is broken down and decomposed, leaving foundations and walls. Subsidence, floods and earthquakes can knock those over too. Grass and weeds build up humus as they root in nooks and crannies of whatever is left. Eventually, you're left with only
