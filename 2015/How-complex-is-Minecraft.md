Actually it's pretty simple. Part of the genius of minecraft - much like the genius of Legos - is that you it _can't_  be too good: the low standard of visual fidelity means a huge amount of work to support finely detailed, realistic graphics and animations can just be ignored in favor of fun and exploration. Part of the proof is the vibrant Minecraft mod scene, where hobbyist programmers re-purpose the game to do everything from Star Wars to Harry Potter.

On the tech side, it's fairly light. My copy of the minecraft client is only about 5Mb (the size has fluctuated over the years). Compare that with Civilization IV, whch was about 1.2 GB or 200 times the size. A lot of the difference is more detailed are files -- but as games go minecraft is not particularly complicated.
