To a large degree it's a matter of taste: artists are usually very emotionally attached to their packages of choice. If you have a choice, get artists who know both! That's usually a good index of professionalism.

The ususl rap is that max is a better modeler and maya is better at animation. Max is more n00b friendly. Maya is a better programming and tools dev platform.

Whatever you do, use an intermediate file like FBX to transport the data â€” don't tie your game directly to either package. That's a lot of extra work that only limits your own freedom in the future.
