"Valediction" itself is Latin: it means "saying _vale",_ where _vale_  is "be well" or "be healthy"; it was a common opening and closing to letters or in personal meetings. In later usage you could end with the abbreviation [S.V.B.E.E.V](http://...) or _si vales, bene est, ego valeo:_ "if you are well, it is good; I am well".

 We know variations on _vale_ were used in the correspondence of the later Republic (say, the first century BC). The earliest citation is I think from Plautus (died 184 BC) but not in the usual epistolary context; however one of his characters uses it as a brush-off, which suggests it was probably already in use as a farewell.

In Greek there was a similar formula: [εὐτύχει](http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph.jsp?l=eu%29tu%2Fxei&la=greek&can=eu%29tu%2Fxei0&prior=eu)tuxh/s), which also means "be well" although it has the additional connotation of "good luck" since τύχη is 'luck' or 'fortune'. That one appears on stage as far back as the 4th c. BC.
