Trying to give good background on this one is tough. It was a bizarre time. To get the flavor you really need to roll back a couple of decades.

__The background__ 

The Goths captured Rome in 410, but it was not the stereotypical "barbarian horde" swarming out of the forests. They'd been in and out of the empire, as individuals and organized groups, for 150 years, sometimes as enemies and sometimes as allies. There was, by this point, no clear line or frontier between the Roman world and the Germanic nations: the Roman armies were largely staffed by soldiers of Germanic descent _(disputed: see note in comments)_ , and many Germanic chieftains also held impressive sounding Latinate titles and positions on the imperial roll of offices. The greatest Roman general of the age, [Stilicho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho#Origins_and_rise_to_power), was the son of a Vandal but was also a Roman Consul.

The lines were very fluid.

To get a sense of how unstable the situation was: In the 380's the eastern empire had fought the usurper [Magnus Maximus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus) in the West, and then in the 394 another contender, [Eugenius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenius). In that invasion [Alaric ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_I)- the eventual conqueror of Rome - fought alongside Stilicho against Eugenius and the Visigoths endured considerable casualties. However the empire's gratitude was insufficient for Alaric and he soon attacked the Eastern Empire; he dueled Stilicho's armies up and down Greece inconclusively -- it's not clear if he was allowed to survive because of politics, or because the Roman armies were too shaky to defeat him, or because Stilicho cut a deal. In any event he was bought off with an imperial title and lands in Illyricum (modern Croatia and Bosnia).

In 401 Alaric invaded Italy; Stilicho -- who was off fighting Vandals and Alans in Noricum (modern Slovenia) -- hired the Vandals to fight for him against Alaric and defeated him, pushing him back to Illyricum again. Many of Alaric's generals switched sides.

__Goths vs Romans__ 

In 405 an different band of Goths under [Radagaisus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radagaisus) invaded Italy from the northeast. This actually was something like the Hollywood image of a barbarian invasion or Marius' war against the Teutones: an entire nation on the march, looking to settle. That, combined with the fact that Radagasius was a committed pagan (it was said he planned to sacrifice the Roman Senate to his Gods and burn the city to the ground!) elevated this above the usual round of backstabbing and politicking. Stilicho scraped together another multi-ethnic coalition army and stopped them -- enslaving the civilians and absorbing many of the warriors into his army.

Over the next 3 years Alaric angled for a commission in the Roman army to fight against the British usurper [Constantine III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_III_(Western_Roman_Emperor)) and/or the Franks, Alans and other tribes who has crossed the Rhine in 406 (dizzy yet?), or possibly to team up with Stilicho and take Illyria from the Eastern Empire (how about now?).

__Romans vs Romans__ 

As the promised campaigns did not materialize, Alaric demanded money; Stilicho, aware of how weak the Roman position was, argued that it should be paid; the Senate resisted but eventually gave in. However the western emperor Honorius turned on Stilicho -- perhaps because of the tribute money, perhaps because he thought Stilicho was working for Constantinople, perhaps just because he had lived his whole reign in Stilicho's shadow -- and had him deposed and then executed. Honorius then orchestrated a pogrom against the Germanic auxiliaries in Italy and their family.

This drove the survivors into revolt. It was these embittered refugees who called in Alaric -- who had never gotten his ransom money due to Stilicho's death -- and together the former Roman auxiliaries and the theoretical Roman general marched on Rome. He laid siege to the city in 408 but did not take it by storm; a negotiated settlement gave him a huge ransom and also freed tens of thousands of Gothic slaves. The capstone of the agreement was to be the Alaric's appointment in Stilicho's place as the supreme military commander in the west and land in Italy for his people.

__The siege__ 

Honorius, with characteristic pigheadedness, reneged on the agreement. The Goths came back in 409.

Alaric tried proclaiming an emperor of his own, [Priscus Attalus](http://Priscus Attalus), but the puppet proved unsatisfactory. Roman factionalism did not abate, however: Stilicho's sister (and Honorius' cousin) [Serena ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_(Roman))was was strangled on suspicion of pro-Gothic activity. There were more negotiations, side-switches, and double dealing until finally, in 410, Alaric laid siege to the city in earnest.

The city was quickly reduced to starvation â€” it had been centuries since Rome could feed itself. Within a few months a traitor opened one of the gates and let the Goths in.

__The Sack__ 

The Goths don't seem to have intended total destruction. [Jordanes](http://Jordanes) says:

> When they finally entered Rome, by Alaric's express command they merely sacked it and did not set the city on fire, as wild peoples usually do, nor did they permit serious damage to be done to the holy places. Thence they departed to bring like ruin upon Campania and Lucania, and then came to Bruttii

The siege of Rome had not been particularly long or dangerous, so the sack was not particularly vicious although of course to modern eyes it was unimaginably bad. Theft, slave-taking, and what is genteelly called "rapine" were the primary motivations of the invaders. These were all, essentially, forms of pay for the attacking army: a successful commander attracted warriors with the promise of booty, much like a pirate captain in the 17th century (there was not much in the way of regular pay otherwise).

Thefts were policed to some degree, because higher commanders wanted to take their share. Post-war politics were not forgotten. Churches were spared (although artwork and precious furnishings were taken). You can visualize something like a huge riot: there are police somewhere, protecting isolated areas, but in general it is something like mob rule. There was not likely to be an organized sweep of the city once military resistance ended; large numbers of refugees escaped in all directions, although they will have hard a hard time taking much property with them.

The worst excesses probably came from soldiers trying to extort the location of buried treasures from captured civilians. St. Jerome's letter about [Marcella](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Marcella) gives an example, but also notes that the two big basilicas of Sts. Peter and Paul were 'safe zones' where civilians could hide.

> When the soldiers entered [Marcella's house] she is said to have received them without any look of alarm; and when they asked her for gold she pointed to her coarse dress to shew them that she had no buried treasure. However they would not believe in her self-chosen poverty, but scourged her and beat her with cudgels. She is said to have felt no pain but to have thrown herself at their feet and to have pleaded with tears for you [Principia], that you might not be taken from her, or owing to your youth have to endure what she as an old woman had no occasion to fear. Christ softened their hard hearts and even among bloodstained swords natural affection asserted its rights. The barbarians conveyed both you and her to the basilica of the apostle Paul, that you might find there either a place of safety or, if not that, at least a tomb

__Aftermath__ 

The sack lasted for three days -- it wasn't uncommon in antiquity for sieges to end with a kind of 'regulated' sack, where the attacking generals would allow the troops to run rampant for a set time before asserting order again: among other considerations, allowing it to run on too long would cause a lot of desertions as luckier warriors took their winnings and departed. The sparing of churches and the lives of important Senators and churchmen was done with an eye to future politics. The emperor's sister, [Galla Placidia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galla_Placidia), was captured unharmed. Alaric was intent on conquering Africa -- in this period it was the most prosperous part of the western empire - and wanted some kind of peace at his back.

Alaric didn't live to make the trip - he died suddenly the same year. His successor and brother in law [Ataulf](http://Ataulf) took over the Gothic throne. It is pretty typical of the age that within a couple of years he was allied with Honorius, and with the former puppet emperor Priscus against Constantine III in Gaul and another would be emperor, Jovinus.

So to sum up all of this craziness, the sack of Rome was the end result of an incredibly chaotic political and military situation. There was not a single strategic conflict between "Romans" and "Barbarians", instead you had a lot of actors in a very mixed milieu: varying degrees of Roman and barbarian, Western Roman and Eastern Roman, different religions (both sides were religiously mixed -- there was even a last minute proposal to revive pagan sacrifice at Rome, but it was abandoned as too divisive; the short term emperor Attalus was a pagan who accepted baptism from the Goths in order to become "emperor") and all against a backdrop of endemic chaos and betrayal.
