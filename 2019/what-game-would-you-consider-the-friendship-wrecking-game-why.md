Without a doubt it’s __[Diplomacy](https://amzn.to/2VPU12g)__  by [Allan B. Calhamer](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/us/allan-calhamer-inventor-diplomacy-board-game-dies-at-81.html).

_The original 1971 edition. But there are zillions of others — for a reason_ 

It’s one of the greatest game designs of all time: despite the fact that the rules can fit on a single page it’s incredibly deep. It’s one of the very few successful asymmetrical multiplayer games (there are seven different countries, each with unique challenges and opportunities).

And above all, it’s impossible to succeed at without being a lying S.O.B. There’s no luck in __Diplomacy__ — no bad hands, no janky dice, just you and your ability to look people in the eye and lie your ever-lovin’ ass off _to people who know you are probably lying to them._ Literally the only way to win is to convince six other people to do things you need done while you set up to stab them in the back.

Of course — that’s true for the _other_ six people too. There’s a reason the game board has been called [The Map That Ruined a Thousand Friendships](https://www.citylab.com/design/2013/03/diplomacy-map-ruined-thousand-friendships/4905/).

End result: paranoia, betrayal, and ruined relationships. I still have a little flat spot on the back of my head from being banged into a locker between high school classes as a consequence of a particularly clever stab in Trieste.

Diplomacy makes _Game of Thrones_  seem like a Radical Candor workshop; it makes a congressional sub-committee seem like a choir of angels singing harmony. __Cards against Humanity__ ______ just makes you giggle about what a nasty person you _aren’t —_ __Diplomacy__ _makes you a worse person._ 

In a good way.
