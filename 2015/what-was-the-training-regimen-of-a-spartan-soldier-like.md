The Spartan regimen is known as the [Agoge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agoge) (or simply 'the training'). 

The best single ancient sources for Spartan daily life are Xenophon's [Constitution of the Lacedaimonians](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0210%3Atext%3DConst.+Lac.%3Achapter%3D1) (written between 400 and 350 BC) and Plutarch's [Instituta Laconica](http://Instituta Laconica) (written in the 1st century AD) . Neither one is exactly what a modern historian would write -- both authors had a very very idealized view of Sparta -- but it's the most vivid description you'll find. It's probably better to read the originals than a summary but here are some of the standout points:

Very young infants were examined and those deemed 'defective' were exposed -- left out in the open to die. At 7, young boys would be grouped into companies and leave home to live in a [Syssitia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syssitia), a kind of community mess-hall which was also something like a platoon in times of war. 

At 12, they would start learning survival skills: camping, and especially foraging. Food was deliberately kept scarce and unappetizing; it was expected that the youngsters, always under-fed, would steal to supplement their rations. Stealing was regarded as good training for the soldier's life, but getting caught was punished as incompetence. Throughout the teens military training and athletics were constantly pursued: close-order fighting, wrestling, boxing, running, javelin and discus throwing were the most important. Spartan education also focused on poetry and music, but they tended to avoid rhetoric and philosophy of the kind that was popular in the rest of Greece.

As teens, young Spartans were expected to take an older man as an [erastes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece#Terminology): something between a mentor and a lover (the exact roles are highly debated, and definitely varied between individuals). This was supposed to be a learning experience and to bond the young man to his syssitia. A little googling will also show you it's a while big kettle of fish... but that's another story.

Around 18 the young man would spend time in the _[Crypteia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypteia)_ _,_ a kind of paramilitary secret police, which would harass or sometimes even kill any helots (serfs) who might resist Spartan domination.
