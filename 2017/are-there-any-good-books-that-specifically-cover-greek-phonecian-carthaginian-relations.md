I’m not aware or much on Greek-Phoenician relations in particular, but that’s mostly a reflection of the fact that most of the evidence is really archeological rather than literary.

The really formative period of Greek-Phoenician interactions (particularly the transmission of writing) is in the Greek Dark Ages — the years between the fall of historical Mycenae and the crystallization of the Homeric corpus. So it’s pretty much by definition not a literary tradition. One of the great tragedies of ancient history is that Phoenicia — which gave us the alphabet — left almost no literature at all. Phoenician and Carthaginian inscriptions are for the most part functional, rather than literary. The only “first hand” work that survives is the fragments of [Philo of Byblos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byblos) preserved in Eusebius; Philo presented what he claimed was a translation of a Phoenician history by [Sanchuniathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanchuniathon), but modern scholars are pretty sure this is a less-than-accurate transmission. [This page](http://phoenicia.org/ethnlang.html) is a pretty good round up of what we know; as you’ll see, it’s alas pretty skimpy.

There’s more actual literature from [Ugarit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugarit), which isn’t precisely “Phoenician” but — because it’s literature was written on clay and was baked when the city was destroyed by the Sea Peoples in the end of the Bronze Age — it’s our best source. We can’t know for sure how close Ugaritic culture was to Phoenician but there are a lot of parallels, so it’s often used as a proxy. Most of the discussion of the Ugarit material is in connection with Biblical archeology or criticism, but it’s often cited when discussing some strands of Greek mythology (particularly Hesiod; see below). You can get some of the material in [Stories from Ancient Canaan.](https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Ancient-Canaan-Second-Michael/dp/0664232426/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1490556066&sr=1-3&keywords=ugarit)

For Phoenicia proper, there’s what’s believed to be a [Phoenician tomb](https://www.academia.edu/524273/A_PHOENICIAN_FAMILY_TOMB_LEFKANDI_HUELVA_AND_THE_TENTH_CENTURY_BC_IN_THE_MEDITERRANEAN) at Lefkandi on Euboea, which was a major point of contact during the post-Mycenaean / pre-classical “proto-Geometric” period. I don’t know much about the archeological literature but I bet that would be a good kickoff point for googling around. The other big hotbed of Phoenician-Greek contact in this period was Cyprus, which was physically close to Phoenicia and a long-term part of the Levantine world. Here’s a pretty good article on [Cypriotes and Phoenicians](http://kyprioscharacter.eie.gr/en/scientific-texts/details/cyprus-and-others/cypriotes-and-phoenicians) which give you an idea of the intensity of the contacts. The historical association of [Aphrodite ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite)with Cyprus, with the sea, and with copper owes a lot to the cultural and commercial relations between Cypriote Greeks and Phoenicians (who coveted the island’s copper).

_A stela of the Assyrian emperor Sargon II (~700 BC) from Kition, Cyprus. It’s been suggested that the Cypriots cooperated with the Assyrians for the same reason they later worked with Alexander against Tyre: because they were wary of their Phoenician neighbors._ 

There’s also a lot of evidence from the western mediterranean, where Greeks and Phoenicians eventually competed for settlement sites. Greeks tended to colonize permanently, where the Phoenicians established trading posts. The Persian conquest of Phoenicia disrupted the Phoenician overseas settlements. Carthage became fully independent when the Phoenicians became Persian subjects, and the western settlements either fell into the Carthaginian orbit or disappeared. But Sicily, Sardinia and coastal Spain all saw Greeks and Carthaginians side-by-side to varying degrees.

_A Punic mask from Tunisia, but it depicts what the Greeks called “_ _[the Sardonic grin](http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?267154-Phoenicians-the-Joker-s-style-death-smiling-(Sardonic-grin))_ _” — the rictus of death caused by a Sardinian ritual poison. This grim bit of trivia shows up in Homer in the 8th century BC, and clearly the Carthaginians learned of it too from their settlements in Sardinia._ 

Mythologically Cadmus, the founder of Thebes, was a Phoenician (and even in classical times the Greek alphabet was the “Cadmean letters”). The controversial Martin Bernal wrote [Cadmean Letters: The Transmission of the Alphabet to the Aegean and Further West Before 1400 B.C, ](https://www.amazon.com/Cadmean-Letters-Transmission-Alphabet-Further/dp/0931464471/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1490552841&sr=1-1&keywords=cadmean+letters)but I’d treat it with caution — Bernal is a polemicist first and foremost. There’s some lip service to Phoenician matter in [Black Athena, ](http://amzn.to/2nCxEQ3)but ultimately Bernal is an Afrocentrist and an Egyptophile — he’s happy to cite stories (mostly mythological) about Cadmus and Phoenicians in Greece, but he really thinks everything goes back to Egypt and his usually shaky linguistics are even farther off when he’s doing Semitic languages instead of Egyptian. Still, might be worth a (skeptical) look.

It’s a common trope that a lot of Hesiod’s imagery and mental furniture comes from the (vaguely defined) “Near East”. Mostly this is connected with Asia Minor, stuff like the Cybele cult, but connections with Mesopotamia are frequently seen in the deep background. It’s more likely given the history that this will come via Syria, particularly via Ugarit, than via Phoenicia proper but maybe there’s something in [Hesiod's Theogony: from Near Eastern Creation Myths to Paradise Lost](http://amzn.to/2mELQsf) or [Hesiod and the Near East](https://books.google.com/books/about/Hesiod_and_the_Near_East.html?id=TM5fAAAAMAAJ)

By nature of the subject matter, [Carthage Must be Destroyed](http://amzn.to/2nkH549) covers a lot of the Greek-Punic interactions before the Punic Wars. A lot of what we ‘know’ about Carthage actually comes from Greek writers, many of whom are themselves influenced by the long and bitter conflicts between Sicilian Greeks and Carthage that created many of the stereotypes and images which eventually reached us via Rome. The book is also pretty good on the ways in which Greeks and Carthaginians (and to a lesser degree the Phoenicians) coexisted and borrowed from each other. It’s as close to a synthetic look at the whole picture as I know of, though the focus is on the western Mediterranean and a later time period.
