The name was never used by “the Byzantines” themselves: they always regarded themselves as the Romans. Long after the Eastern empire had abandoned Latin and lost regular contact with the west, Constantinople was still technically Νέα Ῥώμη, “New Rome” or δευτέρα Ῥώμη “Second Rome.” Greek speakers sometimes did use Βυζαντιάς Ῥώμη, “Byzantine Rome” since the imperial city overlapped the location of the (much smaller and less important) classical city of Byzantion. However that was only when distinguishing their capital from the original Rome. Most Christians in the Ottoman empire were [still technically “Romans” ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum_Millet)in the eyes of Ottoman law down to the 19th century.

The modern usage of “Byzantine” for the empire is actually quite recent. Westerners started substituting the word “Greeks” for the people who still called themselves “Romans” around the 11th century, but the old usage hung on until around the time of the fourth Crusade when east-west relations hit their lowest point. From then on the Roman-ness of the still-living eastern Roman Empire was basically ignored by westerners. However even in 1438, when emperor [John VIII Palaiologos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_VIII_Palaiologos) visited Italy, hoping to find support against the Turks the well informed knew his proper title:

_This medallion is in Greek, but it was done in Italy by_ _[Pisanello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisanello)_ _. It reads “John Palaiologos, King and emperor of the Romans (Ῥωμαίω)”_ 

The modern usage of Byzantine goes back to a Renaissance German scholar, [Hieronymus Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_Wolf), who used the term in part to distinguish between the classical Rome of Caesar and the less familiar eastern Empire that had just fallen to the Turks a generation before he wrote his _Corpus Historiae Byzantinae_ or “Body of Byzantine History” in 1557. This was mostly a bit of disambiguation (like emphasizing “Briton” over “Englishman” ) but it eventually took on negative overtones. Wolf’s distinction was very popular in the 17th and 18th centuries; enlightenment era writers liked to model themselves on the authors and politicians of the Roman republic and the early empire and were eager to distance themselves from the [exotic, highly religious, and somewhat untrustworthy stereotypes that had accumulated around east-Romans.](https://www.quora.com/Was-the-Byzantine-Empire-actually-byzantine-If-so-how/answer/Steve-Theodore) Calling the eastern version “Byzantine” helped to erase it from the prestigious heritage that the _philosophes_  wanted to claim.

So “Byzantine empire” is an exonym, and one that ranges from dismissive to actively hostile. Most modern scholars prefer “East Roman” for that reason.
