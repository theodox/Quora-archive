I'm very skeptical about this one. 

While the general sequence of color words getting more nuanced over time seems uncontroversial, the 'you-can't-see-it-without-a-name-for-it' claim is just another go round of the well-debunked [Sapir Whorf hypothesis](http://www.slideshare.net/ahmetmesutates/sapir-whorf-hypothesis). 

Moreover, the simplified linguistic history in the source is pretty shaky.

__Linguistics__ 

It's not quite true that there's no word for blue in Homer. He certainly uses the unusual phrase οἴνοπα πόντον or 'wine-dark sea' where we might expect 'blue' -- but it's hard to know what that _means._  Homeric language is a very unusual, artificial construct determined as much by the laws of meter as by the pattern of every day speech. We can't know if Homer's phrase is an everyday convention or driven by the poet's need for a useful rhythm: oral poetry is full of repeated phrases which are used as filler mainly for their metrical properties. It is only indirect evidence for the way ordinary people use language.

The Iliad does make use of a word that by historic times (say, 400 BC) definitely covered "blue", but Homer uses it [in a context where we don't really know what it means.](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0134:book=18:card=564) κυανός (our "cyan") covers a lot of different uses: sometimes it just means 'dark' -- but it's also used for, eg, the color of a swallow:

... and that of a striped dolphin:

 Given that this Cretan fresco from Knossos:

__predates Homer by at least 400 years__  I have a hard time believing that the Greeks didn't know 'blue' from generic 'dark' -- I suspect that like our own language there was a lot of squishiness in their color terms, driven by context we've lost. * 

 We do not know exactly what the origin of the color term is - it might be derived from καίω, "burn." But we do know that the Greeks prized copper carbonate in the form of Azurite:

(That's κυανός in Greek and _caerulium_  in Latin) for making dyes. So its possible that the conflation of κυανός and "dark" actually comes from the behavior of azurite, which turns dark when heated; another use of the word was for a kind enameling applied to bronze armor, which might have turned it bluer or blacker depending on how it was done. So it's possible that κυανός means 'azurite colored.' 

__Economics__ 

In Crete, azurite was being used to create pigments as early as 6000 BC -- well before the dawn of written language. Greek painters used azurite for blue, but also imported "[Egyptian blue"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_blue) -- it appears all over the Minoan an Mycenaean map.

But the Greeks and Cretans were pikers in the blue business. In Egypt and Mesopotamia blue had been an important trade item since neolithic times.

As it happens, the [Lapis Lazuli trade network in antiquity i](http://balkhandshambhala.blogspot.com/2013/09/lapis-lazuli-trade-route-4000-bc.html)s very well understood, because there was only one source: [Badakshan,](https://recordsofthepurelands.wordpress.com/2015/08/13/heavan-in-the-rock-the-lapis-road/) in modern Afghanistan, the only natural source west of Siberia. So we know that Egyptians and Near Eastern peoples were obviously willing to pay a _lot_  of money for it if it was being transported more than 3,000 miles. The trade was already international in scope by the 4th millenium BC 

The lovely blue highlights on the funeral mask of Tutankhamun -- just to pick a famous example -- are made of lapis that made the long trip from Afghanistan:

But more important for our question, this image from the [The tomb of vizier Rekhmire](http://www.osirisnet.net/tombes/nobles/rekhmire100/e_rekhmire100_01.htm) in the mid 1400's BC shows Cretans offering tribute to the Egyptians. Note the blue (lapis) beads looped over the arm of the fellow in the middle as well as the already recognizable forms of Greek oil jars and drinking vessels. This (along with those dolphin frescoes above) suggests the at least 600 years before Homer the Cretans, at least, were part of the international lapis network too.

Egyptian tribute lists frequently list lapis among the valuables 'offered' by the subjects and visitors -- including, as the image above shows, visitors from the Aegean. 

The lapis craze was also hugely popular in Mesopotamia. Lapis finds go back as far as the 4th millenium BC. This is a very famous piece lapis from a [lavish royal tomb ](http://sumerianshakespeare.com/117701/118101.html)in 27th century BC Ur:

However -- [at least according to the Sumerian lexicon](http://www.sumerian.org/sumerian.pdf)-- _Sumerian uses the same word for blue and green._ It seems like an awful lot of trouble to go to for something you're not able to see. 

It's also worth pointing out that Ur is traditionally the place where Abraham started out on the journey that led him to Canaan something like a thousand years _later_  than this object was buried in a royal tomb. While the Hebrew bible may not use the word "blue," the entire history of the Hebrew language was took place in the midst of a big, bustling international trade in blue -- it seems far more likely that what's wrong is our expectations of where the word should show up than that they didn't recognize what they were seeing.

_* Purists might point out the Cretans are not exactly Greeks -- though its obvious that they had an outsized influence on the culture of Mycenaean Greeks. The_ _[Palace of Nestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Nestor)_ _in Pylos, for example, has lavish blue frescoes, as do Tiryns and Keros._
