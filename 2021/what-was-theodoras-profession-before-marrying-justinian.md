Procopius — who, let’s be clear, really _hated_ Justinian and Theodora — says she was a sex worker. Here’s his most famous (but not most salacious!) depiction of Theodora’s pre-imperial days:

> …in the theatre, before the eyes of the whole people, she stripped off her clothing and moved about naked through their midst, having only a girdle about her private parts and her groins, not, however, that she was ashamed to display these too to the populace, but because no person is permitted to enter there entirely naked, but must have at least a girdle about the groins. Clothed in this manner, she sprawled out and lay on her back on the ground. And some slaves, whose duty this was, sprinkled grains of barley over her private parts, and geese, which happened to have been provided for this very purpose, picked them off with their beaks, one by one, and ate them. And when she got up, she not only did not blush, but even acted as if she took pride in this strange performance. For she was not merely shameless herself, but also a contriver of shameless deeds above all others.

[Anecdota, aka the “Secret History”, IX.17](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Anecdota/9*.html)

Along the way Procopius provides a lot of vivid detail about Theodora’s career on the stage, in the streets, and in the beds of the wealthy.

Procopius however is a hostile witness. Here’s how he describes Justinian and Theodora elsewhere in the same book:

> these two persons never seemed to be human beings, but rather a kind of avenging demons and, as the poets say, "a twin bane of mortals,"​ seeing that they purposed together how they might be able most easily and most quickly to destroy all races of men and their works, and, assuming human form and becoming man-demons, they harassed in this fashion the whole world.

[XII.14](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Anecdota/12*.html#4)

So, Procopius has to be regarded _skeptically_ . How much of his picture is personal venom, how much is gossip, and how much is factual is extremely hard to untangle.

It’s certainly true that In Roman law, theatrical performers and prostitutes were treated roughly the same — and, among other limitations, were forbidden from marrying members of the nobility. Procopius claims that the law ([Justinian Codex V.4.23](https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/CJ5_Scott.htm#4)) which removed this limitation for women who “having deserted their evil and disgraceful condition… embrace a more proper life, and conduct themselves honorably” was put forward on Theodora’s behalf by emperor Justin, to allow Justinian and Theodora to marry.* The intention is debatable, but the law is there on the books.

More importantly, there’s also [one almost-contemporary source which is friendly to Theodora ](https://archive.org/details/patrologiaorient17pariuoft/page/188/mode/2up)and which describes her as “Theodora who came from the brothel.” The other contemporary sources comment on the piety of the empress, but not the ups and downs of her early life.

Taken together these two items suggest that (a) Theodora was at least an actress as a young woman and (b) the brothel-to-palace story must have circulated within her lifetime. Her theatrical background was a badge of shame with some and a mark of plucky self improvement to others, but it seems to be factual at some degree.

Now, [none of the other contemporary sources offers anything remotely like Procopius’ picture](https://www.mcgill.ca/classics/files/classics/2004-09.pdf); John Lydus and Malalas mention Theodora’s piety, but not a career as a sex worker. There is a late, friendly tradition among Syriac-language source which claims Theodora was the daughter of a priest and was raised to be a nun, but chose to devote herself to winning Justinian over to be friendly to the Monophysite* faction — this is generally regarded as to good to be true.

So, Theodora really did grow up in the demimonde of Constantinople: to the sensibilities of the “respectable society” of the time, whether she was a serious actress or turned tricks was a distinction that didn’t really carry much of a difference.

We can be reasonably certain she was a darling of ordinary people (Justinian, too, generally ruled as a populist and was often at daggers-drawn with the nobility) and a champion of the [Miaphysites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miaphysitism). There’s no reason to doubt that she was attached to the Blues, the more plebeian of the [two circus factions](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/blue-versus-green-rocking-the-byzantine-empire-113325928/). We know that when Theodora was empress, many laws were past to reform the seedier aspect of the sex trade and support women on the margins of society.

Beyond those acknowledgements we’re dependent of Procopius, and his lavish expenditure of bile. This means that all the really good stories — and there are quite a few, since Procopius is always vivid even when he’s less than honest — need to be taken with a grain of salt. Ironically this is just as true for the stories which make Theodora into a feminist icons as those which make her look like a Byzantine Kardashian.



* The linked text attributes the law to Justinian himself - but it’s address to Praetorian Prefect Demosthenes, who held office before Justinian’s accession.
