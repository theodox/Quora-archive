__Homer__  is pretty essential, since so much later Greek literature involves quotations from or arguments with Homer. It can however be tough going off the bat, since it is literally pre-literary: our versions are essentially a 'recording' of an oral performance of works that may be as much as 400 years older than the text. Shop around for a translation that suits you -- there are several good ones but they appeal to different tastes. Poetry translation is highly subjective; some good names are [Robert Fagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fagles) , [Robert Fitzgerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fitzgerald), and [Richmond Lattimore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Lattimore) but there are many more to choose from.

 It also helps to get a good companion to get over the rough bits. [Why Homer Matters](http://amzn.to/1HZHuPe) by Adam Nicholson has great background and can give you the momentum to get over some of the clunkier bits (_I'm looking at you,_ _[Catalogue of Ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalogue_of_Ships)_ ). Moses Finley's [The World of Odysseus](http://amzn.to/1Tz25xK) is a bit dated from a scholarly perpective, but always vivid. If you have to pick one of the big two the _Iliad_  is greater literature but the _Odyssey_  is an easier read, with lots of vivid episodes and less sonorous chaos.

All Greek drama was in poetry, so it's also a good idea to translation-shop there as well. There are 3 indispensable dramatists: __Aeschylus__ is the go-to for heroic and mythological themes -- he's the Peter Jackson of antiquity. The [Oresteia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oresteia) is his greatest work, the foundation of the tragic sensibility. Some people love the [Ted Hughes version](http://amzn.to/1LduDtG) for being good poetry in its own right; others hate it for being inaccurate. __Sophocles__ meditated a lot on fate and its awkward relationship with justice; his great work is [Oedipus the King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_the_King), with By contrast __Euripides__  is almost a modernist in the Ibsen mode; his focus is on people rather than gods and heroes even though he uses mythological settings for his plays. [The Bacchae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bacchae) is a dark exploration of the tension between reason and unreason; [Hecuba ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecuba_(play))is a critical look at the costs of heroic ideology. If you're interested in seeing how much leeway Greek tragedians had with their material all three of them covered the story of [Electra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electra_(Euripides)), which gives a good case study in their approaches and techniques.

For comedies... It's hard to find a good translation of __[Aristophanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes)__ , because jokes rarely translate well. The most approachable play -- still hard without some notes alongside -- is [The Frogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frogs), in which Dionysus (the god of theater as well as of wine) descends into the underworld (in a bad Hercules costume, by the way) to bring back a tragic poet for his festival: it turns into a literary showdown between Aeschylus and Euripides. While some of the jokes are hard to fathom (a few of them are critiques of metre which make no sense at all in English) the overall Monty-Python-esque sensibility comes through very well. [Lysistrata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysistrata), in which the women of Athens stage a sex-strike to bring an end to the Peloponnesian war, is another approachable one.

There is a lot of other poetry, but I'm going to skip over it because appreciating poetry through translation is so hard. No disrespect to [Sappho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sappho), [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod), or [Pindar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindar) but it's hard to appreciate them without their music. Maybe after you've done the easy stuff. In prose there are three big divisions. History, Philosophy and Novels.

__[Herodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus)__ , the "father of history" is a great story teller and almost post-modern in his refusal to be clear about when he's serious and when pulling your leg. He also has a lot of interesting (though often highly inaccurate) social detail about Persia, Egypt and the rest of the ancient world. the [The Landmark Edition](http://amzn.to/1HZKMC0) is a great one, with maps and marginal notes. __[Thucydides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides)__  is a serious, big-ideas kind of thinker who is sometimes hard to read for his rapid-fire accumulation of names and battles; but when he wants to make a point (as in [Pericles' Funeral Oration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles%27_Funeral_Oration) or the [Melian dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melian_dialogue)) he's extremely powerful. There's a [ Landmark edition](http://amzn.to/1SkbXJb) for Thucydides as well. __[Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch)__  is not as seminal as Herodotus or as serious as Thucydides but he is a wonderful sketch artist: his portraits of ancient figures are detailed and approachable even for modern readers -- he's also the most important source for Shakespeare and many other early modern writers on classical themes. There are plenty of other historians but most of them are more interesting for their content than their style.

In philosophy, __Plato__  is the most interesting read even though Aristotle is arguably more 'important' (that's an argument that's been going on without being settled for 2300 years). Plato was also a dramatist, and his philosophical works are usually cast as dialogues: it's a good exercise to alternate thinking of his books as treatise and as plays: the characters have individual personalities, agendas and viewpoints, and when he's on his game it's not always clear which if any he is endorsing. Everybody ends up reading [The Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republic_(Plato)), because it's capital-I Important for all sorts of things; it's also long and dense. The edition by [ Allan Bloom](http://amzn.to/1HZKbQF) is a hot-button topic among scholars but it's well annotated and comes with a challenging interpretation that should be taken critically but is worth reading. Among the shorter dialogues [Crito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crito) is the masterpiece, depicting Socrates on his death bed, while [The Symposium ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_(Plato))touches on many lighter topics. 

Novels is a small category; long prose works of the Dickens variety were not really a Greek product. There was however a sort of picaresque tradition in prose, which produced __[Lucian of Samosata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian)__  (an Assyrian writing in Greek, interestingly) . His [True History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_History) is a sort of Gulliver's Travels, it's sometimes even classed as 'science fiction'. [Daphnis and Chloe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphnis_and_Chloe) by __Longinus__ is a pretty conventional boy-meets-girl melodrama but it does set the standard for many tropes which would be influential down the ages.

One last -- but not least -- bit of prose is [Aesop's Fables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop%27s_Fables). These are valuable as little gems in their own right -- but also because they give a view of the world from a much more plebeian perspective than most of the other sources.
