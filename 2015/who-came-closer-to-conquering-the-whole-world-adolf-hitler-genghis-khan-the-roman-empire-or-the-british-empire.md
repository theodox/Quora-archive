I'll play devils advocate here and say "Hitler". 

 The Mongols and the British both had far, far larger territories under their control than the Nazis ever did. 

However, the Nazis were a different kind of beast: the other empires in the question were pyramidal: the conquerors ruled much of that territory indirectly, defeating and then co-opting local elites. Much of the reasonj for their success (and for the Brits and Romans, their longevity) was their willingness to exercise loose, hegemonic control than in directly forcing their own rule and "values" (scare quotes, literally, for the Nazi version of same) on their subjects. This was a vastly more force-efficient way to conquer things.

If the Nazis had been less suicidally wedded to their bizarre racist agenda, they had an excellent opportunity to do the the British and the Soviets what the British did to the various princely states of India and the Mongols did to China. If they hadn't been such monsters, the task of conquering would have been far easier. Had they had adopted the traditional pyramidal structure they would have absorbed the British and Soviet empires, creating the largest empire in history by far. Many people in the western USSR, for example, welcomed the Germans when they arrived -- only to discover that their 'deliverers' were even worse than the Stalinists. Indian nationalists were sometimes willing to play ball with the Nazis and the Japanese to get rid of the British; so did many Arab nationalists and even some in Ireland. A kindler, gentler Germany stripped of the racist posturing could have made far more effective use of these kinds of fissures in the British and Russian empires to create an even vaster territory.

Of course, whether they could have done so well without brainwashing their people into the attitudes that set them on the road to ruin is another question.
