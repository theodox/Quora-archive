# Similar to how an aspiring writer reads and studies many novels to become an adept novelist, can an aspiring programmer study source code to become a better coder?

The hard part about starting with other people's code, rather than with something less specific to a given situation, is that a beginner can have a hard time picking out the role played by style or taste from that played by the hard rules of logic or technology and those imposed by circumstances. 

 I vividly remember looking through the source code for [Mercurial](https://mercurial.selenic.com/about) several years ago, when my Python skills were pretty D-list, and feeling both lost and angry: some of the confusion came from the use of idioms I was not familiar with at the time (I recall being baffled by [generator expressions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) and multiple assignments), but a lot of it came from the fact that I hadn't got enough experience to understand the scope and scale of the project: I could take apart an individual class or function and see how it worked, but I had no idea what role it really played in the whole ecosystem. I may just be dense, but I suspect that's a generic problem for junior coders: The hardest experience to acquire is not with algorithm or syntax, which are all over the web -- it's with big, complex systems, tied to specific problem sets. 

Unless you can find a codebase with a very disciplined, structures approach to explaining and documenting that high level, it will be hard to learn much. Otherwise it's like learning from a novel by being handed chapters and paragraphs out of order. If you can find an exponent of [literate programming](http://literate programming) in your language, that's great. But they are rare.

I'm a big fan of higher-level books about _thinking about coding_  instead of low-level books about which buttons to push or which library to use. Books like [The Art of Readable Code](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596802293/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596802293&linkCode=as2&tag=tecsurgui-20&linkId=RRPTA6VT5NCEIIAV) or [Effective Python: 59 Specific Ways to Write Better Python](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134034287/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0134034287&linkCode=as2&tag=tecsurgui-20&linkId=UBU46VCCNXSOZ55T) or [Code Complete](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0735619670&linkCode=as2&tag=tecsurgui-20&linkId=7RZZQFGVL7O5OXDH) have been what I've benefitted from the most.

That and being thrown in over my head and learning to swim.
