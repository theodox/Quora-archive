# Did Rhodes always have a Greek population? I am asking because before the island was part of Greece, it was part of Italy, and before that it was Ottoman. So during those times, was the population Greek or Turk.

The Greek settlement of Rhodes [dates back to the Mycenaean era](https://www.academia.edu/4166557/Mycenaean_Rhodes_A_Summary), about 3,500 years ago. Before the island was dominated by the [Minoan ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization)culture of Crete. According to the _Iliad_ , a Rhodian contingent fought for the Greeks at Troy.
