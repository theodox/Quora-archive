The availability of exclusives is an interesting question.

“Exclusives” is a smaller category than it used to be, because most developers would rather sell to a bigger market; as game budgets have gotten bigger the console manufacturers cannot afford to fund as many exclusive titles.

As a rule of thumb you can assume that any game from a studio not owned by Microsoft or Sony will probably come out on PC as well as the home platform at some point, though usually after some time delay. Games from big publishers (EA, Activision/Blizzard etc) will tend to come out on all platforms, although its not uncommon for one of the consoles to get a few bits of exclusive content — that’s something that platform owners can and do pay for. Even console-exclusive series like _Uncharted_ and _Halo_ , which are the crown jewels of their respective consoles, often come out on PC after a gap of a year or more — platform owners like selling to bigger audiences too, once the early adopters have bought the console version and generated some buzz for the platform.

You will not, however, see a Microsoft produced game on PlayStation or a Sony produced game on Xbox. Extra revenue is one thing; giving people a reason to buy your rival’s console is another.

As for the mechanics: the PC version of a console game will generally be quite similar to, but not exactly identical to the console version. No consumer or hobbyist PC runs the exact same executables as a Playstation or an Xbox — you can’t just stick a console blueray disc into your PC and expect it to run.

One common complaint about PC versions of console games is the controls. Controller based games make some assumptions about player reaction time and precision that don’t apply to mouse-and-keyboard players. Not all PC versions get carefully calibrated mouse and keyboard controls: if you want to play console games on PC you probably want a game controller as well or you may find games less enjoyable.

The graphics on your PC will vary from the one-size-fits-all graphics on a console. Apart from minor tweaks from different manufacturing runs, all Xbox Ones or PlayStations are identical to each other. PCs vary enormously and the same game can run very well on one machine and terribly on another that is superficially similar. A good modern gaming PC will probably offer better graphics than a console, the XB1-PS4 generation was not very powerful compared to contemporary PCs when it came out; nowadays those boxes would qualify as fairly low-end PCs. XB1X and PS4Pro are pretty competent machines for 2017, but high-end gamer rigs are still more powerful and in particular have more memory. Depending on how much the developer cares about PC sales, the PC version may have controls that let you turn on graphics options that the consoles can’t handle: higher resolution textures, more shadows, or fancier effects.

Of course, on the other hand that PC version of the console is a PC game, so any given PC may have hardware or software compatibility problems. The range of variations in PCs is so enormous that even big publishers cannot guarantee that their games will run on every PC out there; simplifying the craziness of delivering games on such a diverse set of hardware is the main reason for consoles in the first place.

Oh — you’ll notice I left out Nintendo. They don’t do PC. Nintendo is it’s own thing, it’s almost a different business from the PS/Xbox universe.
