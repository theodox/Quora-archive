While there’s no way to be certain — all demographic numbers in this era are _hotly_ debated, so treat with caution! — there were quite a few.

The Persian territories in Asia Minor and nearby islands included almost five dozen Greek _poleis,_ Cyprus added another ten or so, and Rhodes another three. Most of these were like their second and third tier mainland counterparts, with an urban center of a few thousand and a rural hinterland bringing the total to perhaps 10,000 apiece. But some were bigger: Miletus probably had a combined rural and urban population of around 100,000 — perhaps the third or fourth biggest Greek city on the eve of the fifth century BC. Halicarnassus might have totaled around 60,000 all told. Paphos in Cyprus probably reached 40,000 and Soloi might have been around 25,000. Samos may have been more than 40,000.

Coming up with an estimate for the more exotic locales is even harder than toting up these fuzzy totals, though. We know there were expatriate Greeks living and working in places like Sardis and as far east as Persepolis, since we see their workmanship and find occasional archaeological evidence for their presence. Places like Pamphylia and Cilicia had Greek residents but were majority non-Greek, while many “Greek” cities, even mighty Miletus, had large non-Greek populations. Herodotus sniffed that many so-called “Ionians” were only jumped-up Carians — though as a Dorian-descended native of Halicarnassus (soon to be the capital of the kingdom of Caria) he may have been laying things on a little thick. We know there was considerable cultural porosity in the region, going all the way back to Croesus of Lydia and his gifts to Delphi. So anything like a rigorous accounting of “Greek” would be a complex undertaking.

Lastly, the total would of course go up a lot if you added in tributary cities in Macedonia, Thrace, and on the northern shores of the Black Sea — but Persian “control” in those places was much less concrete than in Asia Minor. You’d need to be more specific about a time range to get an accounting in those areas.

Depending on your taste for adventure and your definition of “Greek” you could defend a number anywhere half a million to perhaps a million, with something like 750,000 as a middle-of-the-bell-curve estimate for the years just before the Ionian Revolt of 494 BC. That event will have cut the number pretty noticeably with the destruction of Miletus, the abandonment of Phocaea and several other cities, and the destructive effects of the fighting.

Another way to think about it is to note that the number of Greeks cities on the shores of Asia Minor was comparable to the number of Greek cities in Greece proper. The usual scholarly hand-wave for Greece proper around the time of Alexander is between 1.5 and 2 million. Although Asia Minor had nothing to compare with Athens (around 300,000) it’s not unreasonable to see a Perso-Greek population approaching the million mark a century earlier.

Do keep in mind, however, that this is an highly hypothetical number with next to nothing in the way of primary sources and only very spotty archaeological survey to back it up. [This paper](https://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/morris/120509.pdf) is far from the last word but it’s a good survey of the many complexities and imponderables in Greek demographics generally.

_It’s hard to find a good map of all the Greek settlements in Asia Minor; this German one from Wikipedia does not include many of the smaller ones but it gives a good idea of how widespread Greek settlements (in red) were along the coasts of Asia Minor_
