# I have a conworld with a premodern republic purposely designed to resemble Rome (Inc. a republic-wide civil war). However, I struggle with how to make the history evolve without directly copying Roman history. How can I make it feel more creative?

If you want some good historical models to help keep things feeling grounded but not a play-by-play rerun of Mary McCullogh, there a couple of alternative republics you can mine for inspiration.

[Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Florence) was a republic that helped to return interest in Roman antiquity to a central place in European culture. Florentines were often self-consciously Roman imitators — but their view of Rome was filtered through a very distinctive late-Medieval lens. Florence’s political culture emerged in part out of the class struggle between the urban mercantile class and the feudal aristocracy of the countryside, so there was an interesting love-hate dynamic among wealthy Florentines who simultaneously aped and fought their feudal aristocrats. You can kind of simplify it down to a dynamic where in Rome the struggle was primarily between the landowners and the urban poor, where in Florence it was between the rural aristocrats and the urban middle class. The rise and fall of the [Medici](https://www.history.com/topics/renaissance/medici-family), along with their contributions to and ultimate betrayal of the Florentine republic are a rich source of ideas.

[Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice) was another city-state republic that fought its way into an empire. The fascinating story there is the transformation of a marginal, quasi-piratical enclave to a vibrant mercantile republic to a notoriously hidebound, socially static aristocracy has some great storytelling moments.

As far as keeping a Roman flavor without copying Roman events, you have a few handles to work with that contribute to a Roman ambience:

__Vertical social ties__ . To a large degree, _The Godfather_  is the best evocation of the social atmosphere of mid-Republican Rome: the complex currency of “respect,” along with the honor codes and obligations that go with it, is the best modern evocation of how civilian power relations worked in Rome. The struggle for influence between rival clans includes everyone in their extended patronage networks, which creates complex webs of loyalties that make for good storytelling.

__External pressure__ . The Romans called it _metus hostilium_ , “fear of enemies.” Despite all of their many internal rifts, us-vs-them solidarity at Rome was always strong. In historic Rome the civil wars happened at times when Rome had no serious rivals — but what if that weren’t the case?

__Integration__ . One of the most interesting and often under-appreciated aspects of Roman society was its multicultural basis. Roman slavery also functioned as an engine for turning foreigners into Romans — probably a third of all slaves (more than that in urban areas) would become citizens for they died and their children would be as “Roman” as anyone else. There’s a lot of storytelling there… historically Republican Rome didn’t see mass movements based on previous ethnicity but the widespread presence of mostly-assimilated former slaves provides a lot of options, from stories about life in the creole subcultures that spring up in that kind of environment to stories about divided loyalties. In this regard you can also learn a lot by looking at the period of the [Social War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_War_(Italian)). You could also look at the history of the late empire, where Romans came increasingly to rely on “barbarians” like [Stilicho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho) to fight their wars.
