No, at least not in the sense understood by 18th and 19th century abolitionists.

The institution of slavery was so ubiquitous that it was essentially unquestioned. You can get some idea of how completely non-controversial slavery was by considering that neither of the two famous Roman authors who had been slaves themselves - the playwright [Terence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence) and the philosopher [Epictetus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus)- ever issued condemnations of slavery. For that matter, the great slave revolt under Spartacus didn’t aim at abolition either.

There was a well-developed discourse on the morality of different ways of treating slaves — [polite society disapproved of the legally-allowable extremes of violence and ill-treatment](https://www.quora.com/Could-Romans-do-whatever-they-want-with-their-slaves/answer/Steve-Theodore) — but that didn’t extend to the idea of abolishing the institution of slavery.

The first Roman to advocate for the end of slavery was probably the 4th century Christian bishop [St. John Chrysostom](http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/4498/DeWet-SHEXXXIV_2_-December2008.pdf?sequence=1). He articulated the theory that humans that slavery was at best a necessary evil and at worst a sin:

> Do you then not consider it shameful to have whole herds of slaves, not knowing that this truly is what most of all brings shame upon you? Did God not provide to us then both hands and feet for this reason that we might not stand in need of servants? Since the class of slaves is not there due to necessity, for otherwise even Adam would have had a slave formed for him, but it is the result of sin and the punishment of disobedience. But when Christ came, He put an end also to this. For in Christ Jesus there is neither slave nor free [Gal. 3:28]

_Homily on I Corinthians, 45_ 

However Chrysostom did not advocate for political change; like earlier Romans addressing slavery he saw individual behavior and not the institution itself as the problem. His departure from traditional Roman moralism, though, was to say that the moral problems of slavery were so vexing that the institution itself should be voluntarily abandoned. As a churchman speaking to his congregants he was interested in encouraging them to personal virtue — not so much in changing existing laws.

Even this mild view remained pretty far out of the mainstream. Its influence was eventually felt in the 5th and 6th centuries with progressive limitations on the power of masters — Christian emperors took away the power of masters to put slaves to death, and their right to use slaves sexually. However they never seriously considered abolishing the institution as such.
