This question includes a roundup of sources.

[What ancient (Roman or Greek preferably) books are there that talk about Subsaharan Africans?](https://www.quora.com/What-ancient-Roman-or-Greek-preferably-books-are-there-that-talk-about-Subsaharan-Africans)

The Greeks had sporadic contact with northern East Africa ("Nubia", "Ethiopia", the land of the "Ichthyophagi" etc) throughout antiquity. Greeks were active in Egypt as long ago as the 7th c BC and Egyptians had long contacts (peaceful and otherwise) with Nubia and by extension the rest of the Nile uplands. 

Contact with western sub-saharan Africa was much more limited and much less well attested.
