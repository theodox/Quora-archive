# Should I learn Old Norse or Latin? I am very interested in Norse mythology, but I also feel Latin will be easier and will open me up to larger range of literature.

Obviously it’s a personal thing, but one objective thing that might help you make the call is the vastly wider array of teaching material in Latin. Learning a language on your own is a significant amount of work, if this is your first effort you might pick Latin as a warmup round since there will be more help available.

If you’re not already a foreign language student Latin will also be a crash course in grammar and structure, making the terminology and concepts you’ll need to pick up ON more accessible. Most American students, anyway, don’t get a lot of the terminology and concepts that a college-level intro to a pre-modern language will require.
