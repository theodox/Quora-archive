It’s rather the other way around.

Originally, most of the population of France — that is, of ancient Gaul — spoke Celtic languages (related to modern Breton, Welsh, and Irish). There were also communities of Germanic speakers in the north and east of what’s now France. However all of modern France spent a _long_ time in the Roman empire: the first permanent Roman settlements in Gaul date back to the second century BC, about four centuries before the Franks crossed the Rhine to live as Roman-approved settlers. Southern Gaul had several large Roman colonies — towns like Narbonne, Aix-en-Provence, and Lyon were settlements of Roman military veterans, though they also drew people from the surrounding countryside. As centers of trade and political power these towns also became centers of the Latin language; whatever they spoke at home the people of Gaul picked up Latin to get ahead in the world: ethnic Gauls were first admitted to the Roman senate in the year 48, thanks to emperor Claudius who was himself born in Lyon.

As long as the empire remained intact, Latin was the language of law and commerce. Over time it became the language of ordinary life as well— there are few traces of Gallic in the later imperial period and it seems to be extinct by around the sixth century.

However the empire did not last forever. When the frontier began to crack — temporarily in the 270s but permanently after 405 — Germanic speaking peoples from across the Rhine made their way into Gaul, sometimes as invaders, sometimes as soldiers fighting on behalf of the Romans, and often as a bit of both. The Frankish kingdom that gave its name to France derives ultimately from one of these groups — during the fifth century they switched from being Roman allies to ruling in their own right. By around the year 500 [Clovis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_I) had united most of the Germanic war-bands operating in Gaul into a new kingdom which would become the nucleus of modern France.

_An 8th century compilation of_ _[Frankish traditional law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salic_law)_ _. The content is Frankish — but as you can see if you puzzle out the words INCIPIT PROLOGUS LEGIS SALIC[ae] GENS FRANC FRANCORUM it’s recorded in Latin._ 

However, by that time some parts of France had been using Latin for more than six centuries. The new rulers were still very much dependent on the existing legal and commercial structures of late Roman Gaul. The Franks were generally not literate in their own languages — if they could read and write at all they did so only in Latin. So they retained Latin as the language of administration, and Latin remained the speech of the Church as well. The language of everyday life in the Frankish kingdom was a[ mishmash of the late Latin of Roman Gaul with a thin smattering of the Germanic language of the new ruling classes on top](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankish_language#Influence_on_Old_French_and_Middle_Latin)* In this regard its not unlike English, which absorbed a lot of vocabulary from French thanks to the Normans but remained an essentially Germanic language.

_Charlemagne — aka Karl — king of the Franks and emperor of the Romans. In addition to his wars and conquests he’s famous for his support of learning and the arts in Latin. Most of our Latin literature survives thanks to manuscript copying done in his era._ 



* Latin itself had evolved a lot by the sixth century — Cicero would probably have had a hard time making himself understood in the Gaul of Clovis, even if he spoke to a Latin author like Gregory of Tours ([Gregory of Tours - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_of_Tours)), but they’d have been able to work it out on paper, just as you or I can slog our way through the quirky but comprehensible English of Malory or Chaucer.
