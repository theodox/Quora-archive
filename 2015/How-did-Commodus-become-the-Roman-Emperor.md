As the other answers point out, he was one of the handful of Roman emperors who actually inherited the throne from his father -- quite a few emperors adopted adult successors and a couple (Titus and Domitian, or Gratian) succeeded fathers who had themselves siezed the throne. Commodus is unique in being both a biological heir and the heir of a peaceful succession.

He was also a classic example of what's wrong with hereditary succession. 

His father, the sober and thoughtful Marcus Aurelius was famously philosophical. He invested a lot of time and effort in providing his son with the best education on the highest principles. Commodus, unfortunately, preferred the company of gladiators and chariot racers to his dad's bevy of philosophers. Marcus, with a touching faith in the power of education (or, alternately, a terrible blind spot concerning his son's character) ignored the obvious evidence of Commodus' real character and elevated him to co-rulership in 177. Unfortunately, on Marcus' death in 180 Commodus began to shed the various sober-minded advisors his father had tried to surround him with, with well-known and disastrous results:

His great simplicity, however, together with his cowardice, made him the slave of his companions, and it was through them that he at first, out of ignorance, missed the better life and then was led on into lustful and cruel habits, which soon became second nature.[2](http://...) And this, I think, Marcus clearly perceived beforehand. Commodus was nineteen years old when his father died, leaving him many guardians, among whom were numbered the best men of the senate. But their suggestions and counsels Commodus rejected, and after making a truce with the barbarians he rushed to Rome; for he hated all exertion and craved the comfortable life of the city.
