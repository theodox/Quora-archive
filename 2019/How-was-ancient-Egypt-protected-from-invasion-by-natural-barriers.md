Egypt is protected from both east and west by deserts. The [NASA satellite photo above](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=64208) gives a good idea how inhospitable the terrain outside the Nile Valley can be — the green “fan” is the well-watered corridor of the Nile but to either side are arid lands which were extremely formidable barriers to ancient armies. The smear extending out into Mediterranean in a desert dust storm from the Sahara — reminiscent of the sandstorm which Herodotus reported [swallowed an entire Persian army marching west into the desert in the seventh century BC](https://weaponsandwarfare.com/2017/09/11/lost-army-of-king-cambyses/).

__East__ 

To the east, the approach was very well protected by the [Sinai Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula) and the [Serbonian Bog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbonian_Bog) (just visible in the above map as a blue-green bugle on the coast between the delta and Israel. The former was almost waterless, the latter was plagued by quicksand. The Egyptians fortified the only viable route to the Levant, the so-called “Way of Horus” which ran about 250 km from Pelusium at the edge of the Delta to Gaza.

For most of antiquity this combination of man-made and natural barriers keep Egypt safe from the north and east. A few invaders did succeed in attacking Egypt from the east: the Hyksos, the Assyrians, the Persians and Alexander the Great — however that’s over the span of about three thousand years, a pretty good record.

__West__ 

To the west, most of Egypt was protected by the [Western or “Libyan” Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Desert_(Egypt)), which ran from the Djebel Uweinat (down by the border of Sudan) up to Cyrenaica. Outside of the coastal strip this was an even more formidable obstacle than the Sinai: harsh, waterless, and prone to drifting sands.

The coastal route was however much easier to traverse, and the Egyptians battled repeatedly with the native Libyans (the [Libu or Rebu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libu)) over the centuries. Libyans [conquered northern Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-third_Dynasty_of_Egypt) in the ninth century BC.

__South__ 

To the south, the border with modern Sudan was marked by arid mountains and the [Cataracts of the Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataracts_of_the_Nile) — a series of whitewater rapids which rendered the river extremely difficult to pass by boat. The route along the river was generally confined to narrow valleys, limiting the ability of an army to march north or south. The fourth cataract (counting from the north) was particularly difficult, since its riverbed is in the midst of a [rough, rocky desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dar_al-Manasir) making portage particularly difficult.

Although the Egyptians and their Nubian neighbors did cross the cataracts barrier in arms in both directions, it was a natural frontier that tended to reassert itself over and over down the centuries. The island of [Elephantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantine), just north of the first cataract, was the traditional center of Egypt’s souther frontier defenses.
