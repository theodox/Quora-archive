Enorchēs would have been the common anglicisation until at least the 40's, nowadays you might see Enorkhēs, which makes the hard χi sound more obvious. I think that form of transliteration originated with German scholars.

If you're thinking of transliterating it the way Latin speakers would, they probably would have done it the same way, although they would not have written the stress mark.
