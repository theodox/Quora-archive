[Daniel Super](https://www.quora.com/profile/Daniel-Super)'s answer makes a really good point: doing it all from scratch is not a good starter project. It's far easier to use many of the bits and pieces you can find -- Unity is really good for this, because there is a ton of material. Once you've got the basics working you can selectively improve and replace the borrowed pieces -- even pro's do something similar. Starting from scratch is something to do your fourth or fifth time out.

In the meantime, you can start with [Lets Make a Game: Infinite Runner](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/infinite-runner), on the Unity Website. It's a very simple genre so a good starter project. The tutorial promises one hour, which is probably a bit optimistic.
