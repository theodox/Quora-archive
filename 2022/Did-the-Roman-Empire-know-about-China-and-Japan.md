Short answer: China: yes, Japan: no.

China was discussed as two different places: [Serica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serica), famous as the ultimate origin of silk, and [Sina](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sinae), the parts of southern China accessible by sea (around the Indochinese peninsula or up the Irawaddy from Myanmar). “Sina” is the ultmate origin of the English “China”. It’s not obvious that the Romans or Greeks were aware of the political connection between the two.

Japan, on the the other hand, was never mentioned directly. The easternmost evidence of direct contact tapers off in Vietnam. The eastern end of the recorded sea routes was what the Romans called [Cattigara](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0064%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DC%3Aentry+group%3D9%3Aentry%3Dcattigara-geo), somewhere near [Óc Eo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93c_Eo) in Vietnam. Very rarely Roman coins have been found in Japan (mostly, in Okinawa) but they circulated as valuable units of precious metal — not as a recognized currency. They’ve also been found in places like South Africa and Madagascar for the same reason.
