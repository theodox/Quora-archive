The originals are long gone. The oldest surviving book-length manuscripts are almost always later than the sixth century; the overwhelming majority of our ancient texts are no older than the tenth. Scroll-based books were very fragile and bulky — when codex (ie, modern bound) books came along people generally stopped worrying about scrolls and just threw them away once they’d been copied into the more compact and durable flat-bound shape.

The oldest manuscripts of the Bello Gallico date from the later 9th century, both being copies from the same French monastery. [This page ](https://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2011/01/08/the-manuscripts-of-caesars-works/)has a quick rundown. Unfortunately it looks like neither of the candidates for the title ‘oldest’ is available online as a facsimile.
