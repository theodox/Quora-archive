The process of decline spanned roughly the years 330–550. At the beginning of that period the population of the city was over a million; by the end, it was less than 50,000.

However the “fall” in 476 was not an important milestone in that development. The really traumatic events were the Vandal capture of North Africa in 435, which cut the city off from the imported food in which it depended for survival, and the Gothic War of 535–552 when the city was captured by the competing armies five times and the civilian population of Italy was reduced to desperation.
