You mean, like [Thebes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebes,_Egypt)? To understand why, you have to first ask why so many Egyptian cities have (in European sources, anyway) Greek names, like [Crocodilopolis](https://www.aldokkan.com/geography/fayum.htm) or [Heliopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis_(ancient_Egypt)). In most cases, when a name shows up in both Greece and Egypt it’s because you’re reading about it in a European source, influenced by several hundred years of Greek historiography. If you could read the names in Egyptian they would not look similar.

The Greeks had the habit of blithely translating names (or sometimes, simply using Greek-language nicknames) rather than transliterating them. So Crocodolopolis, “Crocodile City”, in Egypt is _Shedet —_ the Greek name comes from the fact that the city’s chief cult was the worship of Sobek, the Crododile god.

Heliopolis, “the City of the Sun” was the center of the cult of [Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra), the sun god (its Egyptian name _Lwnw_  meant “the Pillars”, perhaps because it was a prolific source of obelisks).

So, the Greeks translated as much by content as by sound. The lovely (and very Greek sounding) town name of _Oxyrhynchus_  — which means literally “sharp-nosed” — is just a translation of the Egytian _Pr-Medjed:_ the name of the Elephantfish who doubled as a minor local deity. It’s just as if you rendered Chicago in Spanish as _La ciudad del viento_ because people told you it was “the Windy City.”*

In the case of Thebes, the Egyptian city is originally _Waset —_  but here the correspondence with Greek is a later accident. The great temple complex of Karnak was the site of the “[Opet festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opet_Festival)” — one of the religious highlights of the Egyptian year. Evidently the festivities were so important that _Ta Opet_ , the “place of the Opet festival” was a common shorthand for the city, and that became _Tape_ in demotic Egyptian and then _Thebai_  to Greeks, (probably Greeks with Doric accents).

The only other “Egyptian” place names in Greece are hypothetical. The late [Martin Bernal](https://www.quora.com/What-if-any-is-the-part-of-truth-to-Martin-Bernals-Black-Athena/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=292bdc29&srid=zLvM) had a long list of Egyptian derivations for Greek place names to suit his (eccentric) theory that Greece was an Egyptian colony — and idea that might have been halfway acceptable to Herodotus, but does not fly with modern linguists in Greek or Egyptian.

There are of course a lot place names in Egypt which sound Greek because they are actually just Greek — they reflect the several hundred years of Greek domination which followed the conquests of Alexander the Great. Town names like _Alexandria_  and _Berenice_  and _Ptolemais_  are named for the Alexander and the Ptolemaic kings who followed him.

*Evidently, _La ciudad del viento_ is also Zaragoza, Spain.
