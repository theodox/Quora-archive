# Are there people who can speak original languages such as Egyptian hieroglyphics, Mayan, Etruscan, Phoenician, etc.? I know we can read them, but do we know how they sounded?

The strict answer is we don’t — but to a large degree we can make good, educated guesses.

Out of the list in the question, __Egyptian__  and __Classic Mayan__ have living (or at least, zombified) descendants — [Coptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language) and the [Mayan language family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayan_languages), respectively. In both of these cases the modern spoken language was critical to the decipherment of the ancient texts. We can’t be completely sure about how different sound changes work — they [tend to be pretty predictable, but there’s room for debate ](http://www.ling.fju.edu.tw/phono/schools/historical.htm#:~:text=Historical%20phonology%20focuses%20on%20the,shape%2C%20mould%20and%20direct%20modifications.&text=Historical%20phonology%20studies%20are%20important,development%20of%20natural%20human%20language.)— but we can at least see obvious connections between modern words and their ancient antecedents, usually with enough examples that we can extrapolate the missing gaps.

On the other hand __Etruscan__ has no known living descendants. Here we can only reconstruct some of the sounds from the fact that it is typically written in a 7th or 8th century BC variant of the Greek alphabet. That lets us establish some rough correspondences, though of course we know today that a Spanish “r” and a French “r” don’t really sound the same. We also know the transcription of more than a few Etruscan words into Latin, which also helps us get a fix on the the sound values —- but even for ancient Latin there’s a good deal of debate about the finer points, despite an unbroken tradition of spoken Latin going all the way back to the Romans. Sounds drift over time where spellings tend to be more conservative. Thus, we are still ultimately making educated guesses about the sounds of Cicero or Caesar’s era and, by extensioin, about Etruscan.

__Phoenician__ is related to Hebrew. We’ve decoded it’s alphabet which matches quite well to the Greek (which derived from it) and to modern Hebrew (despite the graphic differences). That makes it easy to be fairly sure about the basics sound structure though again, its certain their must be nuances which would be obvious if we had audio recordings but which we can only guess at.

So, we do have tools that let us make solid, educated guesses about how various ancient languages sounded. On the other hand our modern reconstructions would probably sound pretty amusing, if comprehensible, to native speakers.
