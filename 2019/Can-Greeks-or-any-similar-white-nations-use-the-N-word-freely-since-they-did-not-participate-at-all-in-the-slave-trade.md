If it’s logical consistency you’re looking, Greeks should be particularly careful about this. “Slave” itself and it’s derivatives in about a dozen other languages — including Greek, English, German, French, Italian, and Arabic — [started off as derogatory ethnic term for people who were forced into servitude at spear-point](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-word-“slave”-still-used-when-it-originates-from-“Slav”). There’s no country north of the Sahara and west of the Urals that wasn’t part of the Slavic slave trade.

If you’re looking for a legalistic reason why someone has license to say things they know will irritate other people behind a figleaf of historical accuracy… find a better use for your time.
