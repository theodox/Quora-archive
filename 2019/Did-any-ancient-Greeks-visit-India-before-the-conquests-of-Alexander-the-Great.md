The Persian Empire included both Greeks and Indians to some degree, so the pre-Alexander contacts were mostly in a Persian context. The overall quality of the information before Alexander is pretty low, however.

[Scylax of Caryanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scylax_of_Caryanda) was a Greek navigator who, according to Herodotus, sailed down the Indus in the employ of Persian emperor Darius, sometime in the neighborhood of 500 BC. Little survives of Scylax’s account of his voyage, however, and much of what does survive appears to be full of misinformation; it’s hard to know if Scylax himself was a poor observer or if later scribes just ascribed any random tall tales about India to Scylax.

The famous Herodotus, writing a little later, provides [a mixed bag of information about India (Book 3, 98–105)](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/3D*.html). Some of this is recognizable, some seems quite fantastic. He seems to have some fairly good information about the Indus Valley region which was tributary to the Persians, but not much beyond that — his statement

> All to the east of the Indian country is sand; among all men of whom hearsay gives us any clear knowledge the Indians dwell farthest to the east and the sunrise of all the nations of Asia

probably refers to the Thar Desert which straddles today’s Pakistani-Indian border. Herodotus was aware of Indians having darker skin, of their being vegetarians, and that the region hosted a mix of settled and nomadic societies with a number of different languages. However he also claims that Indian semen is a dark as Indian skin: in short, a mixed bag of information.

Herodotus most famously unbelievable story [(3.102–105)](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/3D*.html) says that Indians steal gold from the nests of giant ants. This tale has long been a subject for mockery by critics ancient and modern. However it’s recently been suggested that the story is actually based on a historical practice in the Dansar plain of Pakistan, [where local people used to harvest gold from the burrows of Himalayan marmots](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/herodotus/the-gold-digging-ants/). The theory is that the Persian word for “marmot” sounded a lot like “moutain ant” to a non-native speaker. If that’s correct it suggests that Herodotus was relying on Persian informants rather than Greeks.

The other Greek writer on India who predates Alexander is [Ctesias of Cnidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesias), who was a Greek doctor in the service of Persian Emperor Artaxerxes II. He wrote around 400 BC, but his book survives only in fragments ([collected here](http://etd.fcla.edu/UF/UFE0022521/nichols_a.pdf)). Some of his information appears reasonable, but — like Scylax — many of the surviving quotations sound pretty ridiculous: Plutarch called Ctesias’ books “a perfect farrago of extravagant and incredible tales.”

In some cases it’s possible to see some evidence of garbled transmission rather than outright falsehoods. Ctesias is, for example, the origin of the story of the _kynoskephaloi,_ men with the heads of dogs. It’s been suggested that this is a poor translation of _shvapâka, “_ dog-cooker” — a derogatory term for a person of very low caste. On the whole, however Ctesias doesn’t get high marks for accuracy from either ancient or modern readers.
