The “fall” was a complex affair but it was primarily a game of musical chairs at the top of the social pyramid. For people lower down, it was mostly just the exchange of one set of masters for another.

__Swapping masters__ 

In most cases what actually happened was that the existing structure of taxation went on pretty much as it always had, the new rulers simply delegated the tax revenue from some districts directly to themselves and their retainers. In 475, a landowner paid his taxes to the emperor, who then paid the army and the civil service using the revenue. Between 475 and about 650 the system was basically subcontracted out — the new rulers, who had an arms-length relationship with the educated classes that stocked the old imperial bureaucracy, simplified their own affairs by basically telling different sets of taxpayers to hand over the revenue directly to their followers.

This served three purposes — it cut down on administrative overhead, it simplified the system in a way that was easier for a semi-literate military class to understand, and it diminished the power of the old Roman aristocracy who ran the civil service. On the whole, though, the changeover was not aimed at ordinary people and their property rights — it was not as if a bunch of barbarians just showed up and took people’s houses and fields away. There were certainly cases of powerful military people using their influence to muscle in on people’s property, but that was an old Roman tradition as well — and for the most part the barbarian kings didn’t like it, because it diminished the tax base and encouraged their subjects to conspire with possible rivals.

So on the whole the barbarian takeover was a redirection of taxes from the central government to a local representative of the government. It’s true that it did not take long for those local “representatives” to more-or-less privatize those revenues and turn them into something like personal property — the struggle between the central authorities and their local representatives was the foundation of what eventually became feudalism. On the other hand this was[ precisely what powerful imperial officials and local nobles had been doing whenever they could get away with it](http://Slaves were “property” as far as this system went, so in theory their status remained as they had been before. There were some categories of slaves who were the property of the state, and these became the property of the new elite. However slavery was already in serious decline by the end of the empire — the lack of successful wars tended to depress the supply of new slaves. The breakdown of order made i): the ethnicities at the top changed, but the process was eminently Roman.

__Chaos, sometimes__ 

For slaves — at the bottom of the social pyramid — this usually meant that very little changed. If you were not directly in the path of an invading army (or for that matter, the army of one of the many rebels and usurpers who were fighting the central government throughout the last generations of the empire) your life was probably untouched. Whether your labor went to support the local Senator, or a Germanic chieftain with a new Roman title didn’t matter very much.

In any case the number of slaves is less than you might imagine: slavery was already declining in the fifth century. Between the rise of Christianity, the lack of successful wars to bring in new slaves, and the long-term trend towards replacing slaves with _coloni_  or serfs the actual percentage of the population in slavery was lower than it had been under the high empire. Domestic servants and skilled laborers were still often unfree, but large-scale agricultural work was more likely to be done by _coloni_  instead of on large slave plantations. The new masters liked this arrangement for the same reason the later empire did: it was a more efficient way to work the land. Peasants had a bigger stake in the productivity of their own plots than slaves; with intact families and stable local communities they were also less likely to run away when the masters’ eyes were turned away.

All that said, the upheavals of the conquest certainly allowed a lot of slaves to escape their lot. One of the last big influxes of slaves into Italy happened in 406, when [Radagaisus the Goth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radagaisus) led a large army accompanied by women and children into the peninsula. The invasion was defeated; most of the surviving men were impressed into the Roman army and the civilian were enslaved. However when [Alaric the Visigoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_I) invaded Italy a few years later, many of the new slaves and recent “recruits” fled to his army.

There’s also a lot of evidence in this period for what the Romans called [bagaudae ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagaudae)—essentially outlaw bands of slaves and peasants who took too brigandage when central authority was weak. Some of these groups were ‘resistance movements’, fighting the non-Romans — others were rebels, fighting the Roman state even before the foreigners came along. Many were simply poor and desperate. On the whole, though, there was actually remarkably little large-scale social upheaval despite the change of leadership at the top.

The long decline of the Roman economy — dating back at least to the third century — and the increasing trend towards local self-reliance and away from urban, mercantile civilization produced a society that was fairly easy to take over. From the senatorial aristocracy down to the slaves, most people were already subjects of some kind. As long as the no masters weren’t much worse than the old ones — and, especially in the case of canny ones like [Odoacer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer), they were often rather better — the lives of ordinary people, free or slave, didn’t change all that much.
