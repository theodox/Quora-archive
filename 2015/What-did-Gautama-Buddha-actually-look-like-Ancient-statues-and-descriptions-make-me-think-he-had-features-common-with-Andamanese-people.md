# What did Gautama Buddha actually look like? Ancient statues and descriptions make me think he had features common with Andamanese people.

I can't answer the question of the Buddha's appearance directly, but it's worth noting that visual representations come along pretty late in Buddhist history; statues of Buddha don't show up until about 2000 years ago (400 years or more after Buddha's career) - for several centuries the representations were primarily symbolic -- or at least the one we have were.

 The accuracy of those depictions is also affected by the interesting history of the region where the first statues of the Buddha come from [Gandhara](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gand/hd_gand.htm) (the region of modern [Kandahar](http://rajivmalhotra.com/library/articles/gandhara-became-kandahar/)) was a cultural melting-pot where Indian, Persian, Central Asian and Greek cultures all merged and fused together. It's usually thought that the tradition of free-standing sculptures of the Buddha emerged from that milieu, using Greek techniques that came eastward along the trade routes first with Alexander's armies and then to the prosperous Hellenistic outputs of [Bactria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactria) and the upper Indus valley.

These areas had strong Buddhist influences (first from the [Maurya Empire](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Maurya_Empire) and later when the Bactrians absorbed former Maurya territory into the [Indo-Greek Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek_Kingdom)). So Buddhist patrons in the area began to commission sculptures which used Greek techniques to depict Buddhist subject matter. 

Art historians generally agree that many of the visual attributes of the Buddha in Gandharan art are related to the way that Greek sculptors traditionally represented Apollo: This famous [Standing Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Buddha)

for example shows a very Greek style of drapery and the 'contraposto' stance that's familiar from classical greek statuary.

The topknot and hairstyle in the Gandhara statues is thought to reflect the common depiction of Apollo with his hair in an Ionian knot. In his role as the patron of wisdom and philosophical detachment, Apollo would be a natural source of inspiration for a Greek artist trying to depict the Buddha.

All of which is very interesting -- but makes for a not a very reliable guide to the physical appearance of a person from several centuries earlier (for what it's worth the shaven-headed images seem to come later in the visual record as well). The ethnic features seem to be quite diverse, reflecting either the taste of the sculptors or the very multi-cultural population of the area -- so again, probably not a good guide to the visual appearance of the historical person. 

Just for completeness sake, here's a Gandhara frieze...

which would not have looked out of place alongside this roughly contemporary piece from Greek Asia Minor:

and a Gandhara Shakyamuni

which looks a lot like a late-Roman _Sol Invictus_

(Both, incidentally, borrow the radiate halo motif from Persian art).

It's worth pointing out that there was a different, largely independent set of visual representations of the Buddha which developed farther south and east and doesn't seem to derive from Greek influences (except, perhaps, for the use of free-standing sculpture itself as a medium); this Mathura Buddha doesn't share much with the images above except for the earlobes and the suggestion of a topknot:

The visual representations from northern India, Pakistan and Afghanistan was more influential outside India -- the [Kushan Empire](http://Kushan Empire), which supplanted Indo-Greek kingdoms astride the Silk Road, was the key conduit for the transmission of Buddhist ideas to China along the trade routes.
