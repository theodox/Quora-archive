Well, they didn’t exactly “vanish” — but they did drop out of use. Egypt lost its independence for good to the Persians in 343 BC. Alexander the Great took over from the Persians in 332. For them then until the Arab conquest a thousand years later, Greek was the language of government in Egypt.

So, over the millennium after Alexander the audience for hieroglyphic writing dwindled. Hieroglyphic writing remained a fixture in traditional temples — Greeks and then the Romans continued to support the traditional Egyptian priesthood — but the language of business and law was Greek. Hieroglyphics had never been the language of ordinary people anyway — they were a formal script for religious and government use.

There were other Egyptian scripts ([Hieratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieratic) and [Demotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian))) which were used for humbler purposes, but over time these gave way to Greek or to a Greek-influenced writing system which still survives today as the [Coptic alphabet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_alphabet)

The [last known hieroglyphic inscription ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffito_of_Esmet-Akhom) is dated to 394, but well before that most Egyptians had no idea how to read the writings all around them and a lot of [serious misinformation](http://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/hh/index.htm) was all that Egyptians had to go on.
