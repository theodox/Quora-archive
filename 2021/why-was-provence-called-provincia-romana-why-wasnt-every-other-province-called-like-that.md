This comes from the time lapse between the Roman acquisition of territory in southern Gaul and Caesar’s final conquest of the rest.

Before it was a Roman province, the Mediterranean coast of France was mostly dominated by the Greek city state of [Massalia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massalia)(modern Marseille) a Roman ally. In 123BC , the Massaliotes were invaded by a Gallic alliance of the [Arverni ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arverni)and [Allobroges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allobroges). The Romans protected their client from the Gauls, and in return were granted a strip of territory along the trade route from Italy to Spain (where Rome already had possessions after the Punic Wars). Particularly after the Cimbrian war (113–101) this strip became a popular place to settle Roman veterans: todays Aix and Narbonne both started off as Roman colonies. Massalia was nominally independent down to the end of Caesar’s civil war but the city was quite Romanized by Caesar’s day: it was a popular place for destination for wealthy Roman exiles who fled from political persecution or criminal prosecution back in Rome. Since the province was on the [Via Domitia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Domitia), the land route to Spain, and was also intimately tied in to the coastwise trade it was tightly knit into the Roman economy: Gallic silver flowed south down the Rhone and Roman wine and pottery flowed upwards, drawing a large and active trading community.

The coastal province was known as _[Gallia Narbonensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallia_Narbonensis)_ _,_  “the Gaul where Narbo is” or _Gallia Transalpina,_ “Gaul on the other side of the Alps”, to distinguish it from _[Gallia Cisalpina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisalpine_Gaul)_ _, “_ Gaul on our side of the Alps” (also known as jokingly as _Gallia Togata,_ “Gaul where they wear togas” because it, too, was heavily Roman in culture by the mid-1st century BC). By the early first century, Narbonensis was markedly (though not exclusively) Roman in language and culture.

By contrast the rest of Gaul stayed independent until Caesar’s conquests (58–50 BC) . Caesar’s wars were much more violent and disruptive than absorption of the old Massaliote domain — he claimed to have killed a million Gauls and half a million Germans and to have enslaved another million, and though most modern scholars regard that as a vast exaggeration it gives some sense of the viciousness of the campaign. That difference was reflected in the difference between the “Roman” province (Narbonensis) and the “Gallic provinces” (Aquitania, Belgica, and Lugdunensis). You can see the difference in the imperial-era arrangements: Narbonensis (peaceful and prosperous) remained under the control of the Senate; the other three Gallic provinces, restive and hosting large concentrations of troops, were under the direct control of the emperor. Caesar’s Gaul was also known as _[Gallia Comata](https://www.britannica.com/place/Gallia-Comata)_ , “long-haired Gaul” because it retained Gallic customs and fashions longer. That nickname lasted into the first century: emperor Claudius, who was actually born in [Lugdunum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugdunum), modern Lyonne still used it casually while arguing for [allowing the elites of the northern provinces to join the Senate](https://cmuntz.hosted.uark.edu/texts/claudius-lyon-speech.html).

So: Provence was more than a century ahead of the rest of France in the adoption of Roman culture. It really was a Roman province compared to the much more distinctly Gallic provinces to the north.
