# What are the most challenging computer war games (no "first-person shooter" games)? Any era will do, but I do have a preference for WWII games.

Just for variety, a couple of good IOS choices:

[Battle of the Bulge for iOS](http://www.shenandoah-studio.com/products/botb/) is an area-movement based operational sim. It's almost Eurogame in its level of abstraction but still pretty dense on the historical detail; I appreciate the elegance and fairly spare design (what is it with the grognards and the clunky UI???) The designer is John Butterfield, who did a lot of board games back in the 80's including many SPI classics.
There's an Easter Front sequel and an Afrika Korps version that offers a wider campaign. I'm eagerly awaiting their mysteriously delayed [ Gettysburg](http://the-strategy-wargamer.tumblr.com/post/96087758405/wheres-gettysburg-the-tide-turns) game.

[Battle Academy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battle-academy/id499901136?mt=8) for (there's an eastern front sequel, [Battle Academy 2: Eastern Front](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battle-academy-2-eastern-front/id917359165?mt=8)) is a pretty good job of taking the standard hex-format tactical WWII game to IOS, particularly on a tablet. The graphics in the first are a little cartoony but the UI is good and the game itself is a very serviceable experience. The influence of older games like Panzer General is pretty clear in the design. You can't expect real grognard-level depth in a mobile title but it's a nice way to kill a plane flight (and your batteries).
