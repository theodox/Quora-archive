Babylonian history is long, and it includes a lot of ups and downs. The dominant theme, however, is somewhat reminiscent of Chinese history: cultural continuity in the context of external interruptions and political subjugation.

Babylon itself started off as a “foreign” project. The population and the culture were drawn from the Mesopotamian cultural milieu of the Akkadian Empire, in the 24th or 25th century BC. The future city started off as a provincial market town with a mix of Sumerian- and Akkadian-speaking inhabitants.

__Gutians, Sumerians__ 

However as that empire fragmented in the 22d century BC the whole region was overrun by outsiders, notably the __[Gutians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutian_people#:~:text=The%20Guti%20(%2F%CB%88%C9%A1u%CB%90,%2Dti%2Dumki).)__ . Eventually a __[Sumerian revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Dynasty_of_Ur)__  drove out the Gutians and briefly put a Sumerian speaking ruling class in place; Babylon was a tributary of the 3d Dynasty of Ur.

__Amorites__ 

At the end of the 21st century BC, Ur lost its dominance and most of Mesopotamia, including Babylon, ended up under the control of the __[Amorites](https://www.quora.com/Where-did-the-people-of-Babylon-come-from-when-they-first-settled-in-Mesopotamia)__ , a pastoral Semitic people from Syria who ended up forming the ruling class of many Mesopotamian cities, including Babylon. The famous lawgiver [Hammurabi ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammurabi)was an Amorite — and also a successful conqueror who made Babylon the dominant state in southern Mesopotamia, a position it would retain for most of the next millennium and a half. Amorite Babylon had its [own empire ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Babylonian_Empire)from roughly 1900 to 1600 BC.

__Hittites, Kassites__ 

This first Babylonian empire eventually lost a long and draining conflict with the __[Hittites,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittites)__ ____ an Indo-European speaking people from Anatolia, who sacked the city in 1595 BC but did not try to retain political control. The power vacuum was filled by the __[Kassites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassites#:~:text=The%20Kassites%20(%2F%CB%88k%C3%A6,%2C%20Kassi%2C%20Kasi%20or%20Kashi.)__ __,__ an enigmatic group from the Zagros mountains. They brought new military technologies — the chariot and the horse — which enabled them to recreate a southern Mesopotamian empire comparable to the one enjoyed by the Amorites. Like the Amorites the Kassites quickly acculturated; existing religious and political traditions, many of which dated all the way back to Sumeria a millennium earlier, continued to form the basis of Babylonian life. The key Kassite innovation was turning Babylon from a powerful city-state in an empire of cities into the capital of an integrated territorial state.

__Assyrians__ 

This new, more powerful Babylon found an equally formidable rival in the __[Middle Assyrian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Assyrian_Empire)__ __.__ The same conflicts which destroyed the first Babylonian empire and led to the rise of the Kassites spurred the growth of military and political institutions in northern Mesopotamia. The Assyrians began sparring with Babylon early in the Kassite period, establishing a rivalry that would last for the next thousand years. By around the 14th century BC the Assyrians held the whip hand over their Babylonian neighbors, and in 1235 the Assyrians took Babylon, ruling it directly for about a decade and then using Kassite puppets.

__Elamites__ 
The Kassites re-established their independence about a generation later, but a tremendous challenge emerged soon after: the complex series of social, political and economic shifts known as the [Bronze Age Collapse,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse) which toppled empires and disrupted civilization all over Mesopotamia, Anatolia and the eastern Mediterranean. The end of the Bronze Age also marked the end of the Kassites: Babylon was conquered by the __[Elamites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language#:~:text=Elamite%2C%20also%20known%20as%20Hatamtite,2600%20BC%20to%20330%20BC.&text=The%20Linear%20Elamite%20script%20however,has%20remained%20elusive%20until%20recently.)__ , a people from what is today southwestern Iran, in the 10th century BC.

__Chaldaeans__ 

Amid the chaos of the late Bronze age, though, the Elamites could not retain control. A succession of short-lived rulers controlled Babylon for the next couple of centuries; some of them have Kassite names but by this time a generic “Babylonian” identity was becoming more common. However in a sign of things to come some of these kings were __[Chaldeans](http://Adad-apal-iddin)__ ____ — another Semitic-speaking pastoral group which became increasingly prominent in southern Mesopotamia in the early Iron Age, repeating the pattern of nomadic conquest going back to the Amorites.

__Assyrians (again)__ 

As Babylonia struggled to regain stability, the Assyrians had rebuilt their old Bronze Age domain into a new Iron Age superpower, what we call the __[Neo-Assyrian empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire)__ . The formidable Assyrian king [Tiglath-Pileser III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiglath-Pileser_III) conquered Babylon in the fall of 729 BC. For the next century the Assyrians would rule Babylon, but rebellion was a constant threat — the city was nearly razed by the vengeful Assyrian king [Sennacherib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sennacherib) in 689. But Babylon’s location was too vital, and the ill-will of the southern Mesopotamian population too dangerous — [Esharheddon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esarhaddon) rebuilt the city beginning in 680. The Assyrians conquered most of Egypt in 669, and appeared, for the moment, unstoppable.

__The Neo-Babylonian Empire__ 

However the foundations of this huge empire — reaching from Ethiopia to Armenia — were shakier than they appeared. The almighty Assyrian empire descended suddenly into palace conspiracies, rebellions, and civil wars between 631 and 627. In 626 a Babylonian rebel — probably a Chaldaean, but most importantly not an Assyrian — ascended the Babylonian throne as [Nabopolassar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabopolassar). The resurgent Babylon, in alliance with many other former Assyrian vassals, dismembered the Assyrian empire; Assur itself was razed to the ground in 614. The Egyptians emerged as unlikely — if ineffectual — allies to the failing Assyrians but the Babylonians were, for the moment, the dominant power in the Near East. This was the “Babylon” that loomed so large in the Biblical imagination; it was [Nebuchadnezzar II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar_II), Nabopolassar’s son, who destroyed the kingdom of Judah and carried many of it’s people off into exile. Nebuchadnezzars conquests brought Babylonian power to the shores of the Mediterranean and made his kingdom the superpower of the 7th century BC.

__Persians__ 

Nothing lasts forever, however, as the length of this list of conquerors ought to show. The diverse and feuding peoples of western Iran were united by Cyrus the Great, instantly creating a new military juggernaught. The __[Persians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persians)__ ____ were famous for their archery and horsemanship; although many Persians lived urban lives their military power drew on the traditions of the steppes, yet again providing a shock to the sedentary peoples of Mesopotamia. Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539 BC, helped by the fact that the Babylonian king was an unpopular usurper.

__Greeks, Romans__ 

Babylon did not forget its former glories quickly. It revolted against the Persians several times, but never threw off the Persian yoke. Babylonian records are strangely uninflected as they record the arrival of __[Alexander the Great](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/curtius-rufus/alexander-the-great-enters-babylon/)__ ____ in 331 BC.

Alexander’s empire didn’t outlive him by long. but from the pieces the Macedonian general __[Seleucus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_I_Nicator)__ ____ assembled a powerful but heterogeneous state, with its capital at Babylon. However he decided that he needed a proper Greek capital so he built [Seleucia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucia) on the canal which joined the Tigris and the Euphrates, about 60 kilometers from Babylon. This new center — both a royal capital and a well-chosen economic crossroads — began to eat away at Babylon’s primacy in Mesopotamian life. Babylon was not depopulated over night, but it’s gradual decay accelerated through the next two centuries, picking up speed in the first century BC when the __[Parthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire#:~:text=The%20Parthian%20Empire%20(%2F%CB%88p,247%20BC%20to%20224%20AD.)__  took Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. By the first century of our Era [the Roman geographer Strabo said](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16A*.html#1.5)

> Seleuceia at the present time has become larger than Babylon, whereas the greater part of Babylon is so deserted that one would not hesitate to say with one of the comic poets said in reference to the Megalopolitans in Arcadia: "The Great City​ is a great desert."​

By the time the Roman emperor Trajan took a Roman army down the Euphrates in 116, the city was a desert indeed; as [Cassius Dio said](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cassius_dio/68*.html)

> [Trajan] had gone there both because of its fame — though he saw nothing but mounds and stones and ruins to justify this — and because of Alexander, to whose spirit he offered sacrifice in the room where he had died.
