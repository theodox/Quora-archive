The [Autodesk Education program](https://www.autodesk.com/education/home) will give you a really good deal if you’re associated with a recognized education program (that’s not just colleges and universities — training programs like [iD Tech ](https://www.idtech.com/)get the discount too).

Maya LT — the slimmed down version for use with game development and smaller projects — runs about [$30 bucks a month](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya-lt/subscribe?plc=MAYALT&term=1-YEAR&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1).
