There may be a substrate in the Venetian population with an origin in Asia Minor, though the dominant influence comes from the Gauls of northern Italy, related to the Gauls of France in ancient times.

The region takes its name from a people known as the [Veneti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Veneti). Into Roman times, most of northern Italy was “[Gaul on this side of the alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisalpine_Gaul)” to the Romans. The very little evidence we have for the [local language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetic_language) is ambiguous — it includes clear Celtic influences, but also has some unique features. The Greek historian Polybius, writing in the third century BC, described the people as “very similar” to their Celtic neighbors, but speaking a different language.

A number of ancient writers identified the Veneti with a people from the Black Sea coast of Asia Minor known as the [Enetoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eneti), who had a bit-part on the Trojan side of the Trojan War. Several ancient accounts brought these people to the Adriatic (usually, associated with a Trojan prince named Antenor) — first settling in Illyria and then at the head of the Adriatic, near modern Venice.

This could easily be an example of the Greek habit of lazy etymology, connecting a tribal name with a familiar one from Homer (even a couple of ancient authors propose different derivations). However it may just contain a grain of truth: The modern Veneto is genetically somewhat different from the rest of Northern Italy. It does show a noticeable uptick in the [J2 ](https://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_J2_Y-DNA.shtml)and [E1b1b ](https://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_E1b1b_Y-DNA.shtml)haplotypes, both of which are associated with the eastern Mediterranean : it’s hard, however to really distinguish what might be an influence from Asia Minor from the impact of Greeks, who had trading relationship with the Veneti from very early on and who show much of the same genetic background.

J2 genetic markers are also heavily associated with Phoenicians and Jews, which might explain the association in the question — however there’s no non-genetic evidence (linguistic or archaeological) connecting the Phoenicians to the Veneti, so the linkage seems less probable than either a historic connection to Asia Minor or a Greek connection that acquired a Trojan gloss through a plausible but phony etymology.
