# Why would the inscription of the mosaic above the entrance of Euphrasian Basilica have spacing which wasn't used until the 7th century?

The interior mosaics seem to be use cramped, abbreviated and old-fashioned lettering

Some of them use dividing dots rather than spaces. So this could be a transitional moment — or perhaps that external one could be a later repair job ? If you compare the way the E’s, A’s and R’s are written inside with the exterior mosaic they are not quite the same: the exterior ones seem closer to Byzantine orthography, particularly those lunate E’s. In the second shot above you can see both styles (the more angular one on the mosaics and the quasi-Byzantine one on the square frame around the arch, using points as word separators).
