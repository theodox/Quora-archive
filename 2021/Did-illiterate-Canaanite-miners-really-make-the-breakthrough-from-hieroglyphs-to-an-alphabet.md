__TLDR: It‚Äôs complicated.__ 

The [Proto-Sinaitic](https://omniglot.com/writing/protosinaitc.htm) script definitely evolved from the interaction of Semitic people and Egyptian writing. It was first unearthed in this eminently Egyptian context:

_The_ _[Serabit Sphinx](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/serabit-sphinx-with-proto-sinaitic-inscription#)_ _is a great illustration of the mixed Egyptian-Semitic roots of the Sinai script ‚Äî it includes both a hieroglyphic and a Proto-Sinaitic dedication and was one of the keys to the decipherment of the script. On the bottom register you can make out the hieroglyphic signs for water (ìàñ) and an ox (ìÉæ) ‚Äî these became the alphabetic signs_ ___mem___ _and_ ___aleph___ _and ultimately our ‚ÄúM‚Äù and ‚ÄúA‚Äù. The Sinaitic portion is read as m‚Äôhb‚Äòlt ‚Äúfor the Lady‚Äù, ie, Hathor. (photo: British Museum)_ 

This example certainly illustrates the interplay between hieroglyphics, what would eventually become the widespread and very successful Phoenician alphabet, and the shifting sands of political power. It dates from around 1750 BC and was found in Serabit el-Khadim, in the southwestern Sinai. It‚Äôs dedicated to Hathor in her role as ‚Äúmistress of turquoise‚Äù ‚Äî the region was of interest to Egypt primarily for its turquoise mines. But it doesn‚Äôt tell us where the impetus for the new use of the hieroglyphic characters came from.

It‚Äôs certainly suggestive that the evolution of what would eventually become the Semitic Phoenician alphabet was first attested in a colonial industrial area The conclusion that it evolved as a way for Egyptian overseers and their non-Egyptian miners to communicate is an easy and compelling one, championed in particular by [Orly Goldwasser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orly_Goldwasser). However, there‚Äôs no conclusive way to show whether the script originated ‚Äúfrom below‚Äù ‚Äî as an adaptation by the Semitic workers ‚Äî or ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù, as a device created by Egyptian administrators to help organize the mines.

The [discovery of what looks like a somewhat earlier inscription in Wadi El Hol about 20 years ago](https://archive.archaeology.org/0001/newsbriefs/egypt.html) complicates the picture without really resolving the question. Palaeographers think the form of the hieroglyphics in the Wadi el-Hol inscriptions dates them earlier than the Serabit el-Kadim, and they tantalizingly mention the existence of a ‚Äúscribe of the Asiatics‚Äù (for an Egyptian, that meant anybody from east of Sinai, including proto-Arab bedouins or Canaanites). That is fuel for the ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù hypothesis, but hardly a slam dunk: we don‚Äôt know enough about the bureacratic niceties of the thirteenth dynasty to be sure what it implies.

The picture is also complicated by what we do know: that the [thirteenth dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt) was a period in which Egypt was at a low ebb. The thirteenth dynasty coexisted uneasily with the [fourteenth ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt)‚Äî usually identified with ‚ÄúAsiatic‚Äù rulers centered on [Avaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaris), outside the traditional Egyptian centers of power. The thirteenth eventually gave way (ca. 1650 BC) to the the [Hyksos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyksos), another group usually identified as Semites. So this is a period when the balance of power between Egypt and her neighbors to the east was in flux: the script might be a bottom up project by bunch of workers, or a top down project by Egyptian bureaucrats ‚Äî or it might be some kind of effort on the part of an ‚ÄúAsiatic‚Äù elite trying to create a method of recording its own language through Egyptian intermediaries. It‚Äôs hard to be sure: that‚Äôs one reason the [Encyclopedia of Egyptology entry for Wadi el-Hol ](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1sd2j49d)is studiously vague:

> Employing signs derived from lapidary hieratic Egyptian shapes, and assigning to this limited number of signs acrophonic values based on the Semitic-language names of the objects depicted, the melting pot of Egyptian expeditionary forces gave rise to the alphabet during the Middle Kingdom

However it‚Äôs also argued ‚Äî more room for debate! ‚Äî that the glyphs adopted for proto-Sinaitic are derived from Old Kingdom forms, dating two or three centuries earlier than our oldest examples,

One good point to ponder ‚Äî though it‚Äôs of course not conclusive ‚Äî is that a native Egyptian speaker might have preferred to retain the Egyptian sound values for the signs. Proto-Sinaitic uses the initial sounds of the semitic names for the hieroglyphic images: a glyph of an ox becomes _aleph_ , an ox rather than retaining it‚Äôs Egyptian sound value of k:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-05f78ae7c51db5527044315c227d2179)

That _seems_ like a good argument for the innovation coming from a Semitic speaker rather than an Egyptian ‚Äî but it‚Äôs hardly conclusive: a bilingual Egyptian could just as easily have made that call: a ‚Äúscribe of the Asiatics‚Äù, for example.

So: we can be confident that proto-Sinaitic began with the mixing of Egyptian and Canaanite culture ‚Äî but we can‚Äôt be too certain beyond that.
