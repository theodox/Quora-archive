It's probably [Diocletian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian)(reigned 284-305). According to [Eutropius](http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans9.html):

> He was the first that introduced into the Roman empire a ceremony suited rather to royal usages than to Roman liberty, giving orders that he should be adored, whereas all emperors before him were only saluted. He put ornaments of precious stones on his dress and shoes, when the imperial distinction had previously been only in the purple robe, the rest of the habit being the same as that of other men. 

Where _adored_ is _ad-oratio_ , "praying to", but that's a Latin synonym for the fuzzy Greek term _[proskynesis,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proskynesis)_ __ which could cover anything from bowing to recieve a kiss on the top of the head to throwing yourself at the emperors' feet. It's not entirely clearly which forms were used when, or if the requirement came and went with different courts.

 It's also certain that this sort of thing happened out in the provinces well before this time. Alexander and his successors had [made prostration a key part of diplomatic and court protocol](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/proskynesis/) (Alexander executed his own biographer, [Callisthenes](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/callisthenes-of-olynthus/), for mocking the new royal rituals). In the 2d century BC, King Prusias of Bythinia had shocked and embarrassed the Roman senate by prostrating himself before them and addressing them as 'divine saviors', and many Roman generals on campaign had been offered similar honors -- one, [Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Caecilius_Metellus_Pius) was notorious for pleasure he took in being treated like a god.
