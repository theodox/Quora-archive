# Why do we refer to the empire as the 'Ancient Romans' and not the 'Ancient Italians'? Was Rome governed as a separate entity?

The short version is that the city-state of Rome conquered Italy gradually, roughly between 509 and 88 BC. During most of that period Rome was the leading, but not the only state in Italy. The other city-states and tribal confederacies retained a lot of local autonomy even as Rome came to dominate the peninsula; it was probably only in the first century AD that Latin became the majority language of Italy and even then most people’s primary identities were local first and Roman second.

This picture is a bit more complex because the “Roman” armies which conquered the “Roman” empire were rarely more than 50% composed of Romans proper. The deal which Rome made with defeated enemies let them retain a lot of local control over their internal affairs in return for supplying troops to Rome’s campaigns Over time the military alliance promoted the Romanization of the peninsula, spreading the Latin language and identification with Roman institutions to peoples who had previously been enemies.

After the first century BC this process was also transplanted to other areas outside Italy — Spain, Gaul, and eventually the whole Mediterranean basin — creating a new “Roman” identity that was detached from the city of Rome proper. Locals served in the imperial armies and aspired to Roman citizenship as a mark of status. In 212 all free persons in the empire became “Roman” by law, regardless of their ethnicity or language — there were “Romans” from Morocco to Armenia, many of whom had no connection to Italy of any kind.
