I'm with [Daniel Super](https://www.quora.com/profile/Daniel-Super), the scope and level of polish in _Last of Us_  is enormous. I don't have any hard numbers but I'd be shocked if the budget was less than $50 million and could easily see it being $75M -- and that's not counting a lot of special advantages: ND has a very close relationship with Sony and can call on special technical assistance as needed; they have a veteran team, many of which have been together a long tine; and they have a deep proprietary tech stack with years of work in custom tools and infrastructure as well as their engine.
