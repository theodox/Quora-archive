By far, the big black hole in my personal knowledge is Chinese history.

With a background in the ancient history of Europe and the Middle East, I’m very aware of how different things look when you read the original sources, even if you don’t read them fluently. I hate relying entirely on synthetic second-hand sources. Much of the nuance (and just as important, so much of the fun) comes from looking at primary source material.

Despite my best efforts, I’m barely capable of even “restaurant Mandarin” and am utterly baffled by _hanzi._ Worse than that, I don’t even feel like I can engage very profitably with the sources that are available in translation. Given how much Chinese literature relies on precisely the kinds of things that translation is bad at capturing — allusions, echoes, and poesy — I’m hugely intimidated.

To a lesser degree I also feel like I need to get a better grasp on Islamic history. The language barrier applies there as well, of course, though somewhat less brutally because a lot of the Arabic and Persian literature was written by people who were also conversant with the Greco-Roman material I do know, so I can compensate a little for the context when reading in translation.

After that — there’s an infinity of other stuff to learn. With kids and a job I don’t have the luxury of just grabbing stuff of a bookshelf and really immersing myself the way I’d like. Maybe when I retire…
