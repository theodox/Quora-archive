If you mean big-D Democracy, formal rule by The People, it goes back to a rough period in the history of [Athens, Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy).

In 510 BC the people of Athens drove out their ruler, the tyrant [Hippias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippias_(tyrant)). In Greek “tyrant” had less negative connotations than it does in English, but the last several years of Hippias’ reign were pretty nasty and he was deeply unpopular. So a group of Athenian aristocrats, along with some help from Sparta, chased Hippias out and the city had to create a new government.

The difficult bit was that the tyrant was bad — but a lot of Athenians didn’t trust those aristocrats either. The whole reason Athens had gotten one-man rule in the first place was that the aristocrats had been leaning very heavily on the poor. To make things worst one of the Spartan-supported noblemen, [Isagoras.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isagoras) started acting very much like the tyrant that had just been dethroned.

Luckily for Athens, a rival politician named [Cleisthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleisthenes) was able to organize another uprising, this time against Isagoras and his Spartan military supporter. The common people and the moderate aristocrats were united — for once — by suspicion of both Isagoras and Sparta. Cleisthenes created a new form of government for the city that was design to minimize the dangers of both a populist tyrant and aristocratic oppression.

Cleisthenes’s system minimized the power of the existing city council, since that was dominated by the nobles. All power was put directly into the hands of the entire citizen body, which met to debate and pass judgement on every important question in the city: every (male, free) citizen voted on every law, every treaty, every declaration of war, and every tax. There were still government officials, but they were chosen by lot: literally anybody could end up as a magistrate. No campaigning, no votes: just the luck of the draw. The only exception was the choice of generals, which was done by election; otherwise the thing that kept the newly chosen officers in check was the knowledge that they could be tried and executed at the end of their terms for acting unconstitutionally.

Cleisthenes called this system [Isonomia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isonomia), “equality before the law” but because it placed power in the hands of the entire citizen body — in Greek, the _demos_ , it became better known as “democracy”. Although the system only lasted in Athens for a few hundred years, those were the peak of classical Greek culture — they produced literature, science, and philosophy that have remained part of European culture ever since.

It probably goes without saying that the Athenian system is unlike any modern state. Modern “democracies” are really representative republics. However, the idea that the only right basis for political power is the formal consent of the citizens is part of the heritage of Athenian democracy.



If you are asking a much broader question about voting and representative government in general, that’s a harder one to answer. The real origins of “getting people together to debate what to do” and “picking some people out of the group to run things so the rest of us can go about our business” go all the way back to the dawn of civilized life. Cities in ancient Mesopotamia had[ city councils and some kind of voting](https://www.quora.com/How-did-hunter-gatherer-societies-transition-into-authoritarian-ways-of-life-and-how-did-the-first-kings-come-to-power) at least four thousand years ago, even though most of them were ruled by priests or kings.

That kind of “primitive democracy” has been re-invented many times over. Whenever governments are not big or sophisticated, the only way to mobilize labor or defend the group is for people to cooperate. Four thousand years ago there was no department of highways: if you needed a road built you had to convince enough people to show up with shovels. There was, early on, no standing army: if you needed to defend the city everybody had to bring his own sword.

In that kind of world many decisions could only be made by public debate and group consensus: there was simply no powerful state that could force people to do things any other way. The difference between Athenian democracy and this kind of system is that the Athenian version is a self-conscious choice, a deliberately designed system rather than what you get when there is no system.
