Well nobody’s going to _stop_  you, but you should generally be aware that they are usually addressing very different kinds of questions.

The meanings of many common words were very much up for grabs in late-classical Athens and the philosophers expended a lot of energy trying to lay out how, exactly, you went about arguing over things. That’s why Plato expends so much time on Socrates pointing out the ambiguities and hidden assumptions in people’s use of conventional language, and why Aristotle is so careful (and sometimes, so pedantic) with his definitions: they were very engaged in the then-new business of figuring out how you try to build a solid argument from the squishy material or ordinary language.

Lucretius is very different: he’s a popularizer more than a philosopher. Most of what’s striking in Lucretius is his ability to explain, illustrate and simplify the ideas of [Epicurus](http://www.iep.utm.edu/epicur/). Although Epicurus was fairly critical of the Platonic tradition in particular, most of that does not come through in Lucretius.

By way of analogy, it’s kind of like choosing between reading Sir Isaac Newton and H.G. Wells. Plato and Aristotle were engaged in making something new, Lucretius was trying to present a mass-market friendly version of something that already existed.

Generally the innovators are harder to read effectively, because they are often making up their own language as they go along; but grappling with them is also more fruitful. Lucretius is of course also translating Greek ideas into Latin too, so reading him in translation will be a bit further from the ultimate source of his ideas.

If you aren’t already familiar with classical literature a good annotated edition will help a lot, ancient stylistic conventions and references can easily get in your way if you just start reading.
