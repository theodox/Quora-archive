Do you know anything tricky? Like playing piano or programming or riding a unicycle?

You probably remember when you started, and you felt really impressive because you were picking up this difficult skill and impressing everybody. If you stuck it out longer you like realized you were really at the beginning of the learning curve and had a long way to go. 

Only when most people get really good at things do they realize how far they have to go to be great. My 9 year old thought she was ready for a concert career after she learned her second piano song; the best musician I've ever met does nothing but admire skills in others he thinks he'll never achieve in a million years. 

Life's really, really complicated and nobody ever masters it. Most of us spend a lot of our lives with that beginner's over-inflated sense of accomplishment. Luckily most of us outgrow it :)
