Thucydides was about a generation older than Xenophon. They overlapped a bit in time — Thucydides died when Xenophon was about 30. In the ordinary course of life at Athens one would expect a nodding acquaintance between two aristocrats.

However Thucydides was exiled from Athens after the Athenian loss at [Amphipolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphipolis) in 424 BC. He spent the next twenty years — from Xenophon’s 6th to his 26th year — in exile. He traveled around Greece as part of this recording of the war, but for the most part lived on an (evidently quite extensive) family estate in Thrace. One ancient accounts says Thucydides never returned to the city — he was legally allowed to return following the fall of the democracy in 404, but was murdered on his way home. Another tradition implies that he lived a few years longer but again that he was murdered in Thrace. In either case, there’s no reason to think he was a regular presence in Athens before his death. We don’t know much about either man’s movements in the last decade of the war — it’s not _impossible_ that they would find themselves crossing paths somewhere during Xenophon’s military service but it’s not recorded anywhere.

Xenophon left Athens himself in 401 to join the [expedition of the Ten Thousand](https://www.historynet.com/odyssey-of-the-ten-thousand.htm), and would not return to Greece for two years. The aftermath of that campaign saw Xenophon fighting in Thrace… again, it’s _possible_  that if Xenophon had not already died on his return to Athens their paths might have crossed, and again, there’s no source that says they did.

All that said: Xenophon was obviously aware of Thucydides: his [Hellenica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenica) picks up right where Thucydides’ unfinished work leaves off. It has often been suggested that Xenophon was the editor of the version of Thucydides that we have today, since the book literally starts “Following these events…” — an opening which makes little sense unless (a) we’ve lost much of Xenophon’s work or (b) he saw himself as literally continuing Thucydides. History was still a new discipline, and there was no established protocol to dictate how two authors covering the same events should relate to each other.

TLDR: Xenophon was a popular writer who left several intact works, and was not entirely averse to talking about himself. So it’s unlikely that he met Thucydides in person — an anecdote like that would probably have survived — but he was clearly aware of Thucydides’ work.

Evidently there’s also [a historical novel ](https://www.amazon.com/Strategist-Exile-Xenophon-Death-Thucydides/dp/1473846994)which alleges a friendship between the two.
