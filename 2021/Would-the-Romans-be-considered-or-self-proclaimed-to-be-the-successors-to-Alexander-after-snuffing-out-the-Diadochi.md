The Romans didn’t make any effort to legitimate themselves as heirs to Alexander or anything along those lines.

From their own perspective, the situation was quite simple. Defeat on the battlefield placed the defeated in the power of the victors. The nature of the surrender (and to some degree, how hard the fight had been) dictated the severity of the outcome. In the aftermath the behavior of both sides was essentially established by a contract forged on the field.

Surrender on terms____ typically meant that the losers would retain their property (most of, anyway) and their lives by becoming dependents of the Roman state. Rome would guarantee their safety and allow them to retain local control of their own affairs but anything which might imply true independence — above all, having a foreign policy that didn’t reflect Roman interests — was off the table. It was formally an alliance — though a very unequal one.

Romans referred to this relationship as _fides, “faith” or “trust”_ and they regarded it as a permanently binding contract. The most signal examples of real brutality by Roman armies were directed against former enemies who had once surrendered, accepting the Roman bargain and then reneging later. The Romans prided themselves (not always honestly, but that’s another matter) on holding up their end of the bargain; they expected the other side to take it with equal seriousness. If the Romans needed to legitimize their holdings, they appealed to _fides:_ “We stick with our bargains and we expect you to as well.”

In the case of the Hellenistic kingdoms, the normal course of events was the first one: surrender followed by limited local autonomy. First the Macedonians, then the Seleucids, and finally the Ptolemies all succumbed to Roman arms and accepted Rome’s version of surrender with limited autonomy and a forced “alliance” with Rome.

In the case of Macedonia the bargain fell through: after the [Third Macedonian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Macedonian_War) (the first was a minor conflict; the the second ended with a “permanent alliance” ) the Romans finally dissolved the Kingdom and administered Macedonia as a province.

The Seleucids were never completely conquered by Rome — but after the Romans forced them out of Greece in the [Syrian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman%E2%80%93Seleucid_War) their empire began to crumble on its own; Rome eventually scooped up the disjointed pieces near the Mediterranean but the rest fell to the Parthians. Even here the Romans went in for client states ([Commagene ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Commagene)and [Hasmonean Judaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasmonean_dynasty#:~:text=The%20Hasmonean%20rulers%20took%20the,the%20Great%20in%2037%20BCE.)) where they could. Syria and Phoenicia became provinces only after being taken from Tigranes of Armenia.,

Egypt was a longtime Roman client (it was[ a Roman diplomat who turned back a Seleucid army singlehanded who created the first “line in the sand”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Popillius_Laenas)). Its misfortune was to be caught backing the wrong side in a Roman civil war — but by that point in time Egyptian independence had been heavily dependent on Roman arms for a century so the Romans already more or less regarded Egypt as “theirs.” The only twist was that — thanks to the civil war — it [passed directly into the personal control of the Augustus](https://www.quora.com/After-the-death-of-Cleopatra-did-the-title-of-pharaoh-become-associated-with-Roman-emperors-How-did-the-Romans-reconcile-the-principate-emperors-with-the-position-of-a-foreign-king/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=77aa535d&srid=zLvM) rather than becoming a beholden to the Roman republic and people.

In all of these cases the Romans didn’t need to pretend that they inherited some kind of legitimacy from the governments they defeated: they were the victors and the defeated lived by accepting their _fides._ That was all they needed. One of the seedier legacies of the Hellenistic era was a particularly callous attitude towards the truth: the Macedonian dynasts were none of them regarded as men of their words. So, considering the scant legitimacy which the ups-and-downs of Hellenistic politics had for many in the Greek world the frank and Roman attitude was probably an improvement for many.

_The first life portrait of a known Roman:_ _[Titus Quinctius Flamininus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Quinctius_Flamininus)_ _, the Roman general who defeated Macedonia. He was extraordinarily popular among (non-Macedonian) Greeks for his policy after the war, which was little more than the traditional Roman offer of_ fides. _He was honored as a god — in the semi-serious manner common to Hellenistic kingdoms — in several Greek cities._ 



A separate, less benign dynamic emerged in the last two generations of the Republic, when the intense political competition at Rome encouraged serious misbehavior by Roman officials abroad. However in the early days of Roman hegemony, Rome’s biggest PR move was simply not behaving quite as badly as the Macedonians, Ptolemies and Seleucids were wont to do.
