"History is written by the victor" is just a lazy truism. It's pretty much a BS truism at that.

History is written by the _writers._ Obviously it's rather difficult to bang out a historiographical monograph if you've been wiped from the face of the earth -- but barring that multiple versions of events will survive. And that version will enter into the same stream of arguments, disagreements and conflicting versions of events that we all live through in real-time. History is and was ___just as full of disagreements as the present___  . Show of hands: is the Iraq War 'just about oil?' Is there a 'homosexual agenda?' 

Recovering the 'truth' of the past is just like getting through Thanksgiving dinner with a big extended family: it's a long series of arguments, most of which are inconclusive. People evaluate the past with the same set of filters they use when watching the TV news: most of them will listen to the versions that flatter their prejudices and received opinions and a handful will do some extra homework, seek out new data and form their own conclusions... and largely get ignored by people who don't want to be bothered and like a simpler story in which their side is the good guys.

The minority that cares does do a lot of spadework. Slowly, over time, they whittle down the controversies enough to exclude the really crazy stuff: we still argue about whether the Pyramids represent a spontaneous upwelling of Egyptian spiritual devotion, a form of workfare, or a [gigantic slave labor camp](https://www.quora.com/Who-believes-the-pyramids-were-built-using-slave-labor) where poor Egyptians worked themselves like dogs to build vanity tombs for the wealthy -- but we generally don't find a lot of reason to believe they were built by aliens or Charlton Heston. Even there, of course, you can see how there are plenty of streams of argument -- including obscurantist minority views -- that are not likely to ever go away. 

When people who care about this stuff are very lucky and persistent they may dig up a piece of evidence that's been lost or ignored for a long time and the terms of the debate will actually shift a bit. Sometimes there is real detective work to do that 'proves' something in a court-of-law sort of way: it's not hard for example to prove from textual evidence that the [The Protocols of the Elders of Zion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion) is a deliberate fabrication.  But even then you just can't convince everybody: a century later the Protocols remains a commonly cited pseudo-history in many places where people are eager to believe the worst about Jews.

In short, history isn't written by the victors: like the internet, it's written by anybody with an opinion and some time to spare. And, like the internet it's full of a nearly infinite range of facts and quasi-facts, of opinions that are carefully weighed and sifted but also opinions that are dashed off by cocksure loudmouths with nothing but prejudice to guide them. And of course history offers the additional temptation of talking smack about people who aren't around to defend themselves, so it's got a perennial appeal to axe-grinders of all stripes.

Its enough to make you _wish_  history was written by the victors. That would be easier to understand. The saving grace is that -- like the internet -- historical writing includes a lot of people who are curious and clever and like to figure things out -- and who are willing to admit when they don't know it all. You can do a lot worse than to find those kinds of people and listen to them.
