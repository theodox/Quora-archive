This guy thinks he's got it cracked:



I'm skeptical. While this is pretty serious scholarship it seems to my (un-expert) eyes like there are two flaws. 

First, some of the Phaistos -> linear A -> Linear B analogies they use seem within the realm of "looks kinda like" -- without better texts to work with they should be treated as conjectural. 

Second, the "key word" in the in translated text appears to be _ikwekurja_  which they translated as ικυεία (= horse goddess?) κόρη (= __  a maiden). I'm not enough of a linguist to be sure if the swap of k for p in ikwe is likely*; however I feel like it's tough when the lynchpin of the translation is pretty much a one-off word.

The closest analogy in known texts would be Ἱππεία, a rare title of Athena's as 'horsey Athena', the aspect of Athena in charge of chariotry. But Athena was generally not associated with fertility and was regarded -- even in Greek poetry -- as a 'masculine' goddess unconcerned with women's affairs: it make her an odd candidate for the much more gyno-centric Cretan goddess. In classical times κόρη would be Demeter, who has no known association with horses.

 Still: it's a decent try, it really needs something nice and prosaic as a confirmation before I'd call it solved. Details here: [TEI of Crete - Daidalika](http://www.teicrete.gr/daidalika/pages/page.php?page=home) 

* they are both plosives so it's not imposssible: thats how Latin gets _quinque_  where Greek has _pente_  for 'five'
