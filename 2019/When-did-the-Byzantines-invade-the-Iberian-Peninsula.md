The Byzantines invaded in the summer of 552, following internal fighting between different factions in Visigothic Spain. The byzantines were invited in by one of the factions but the sources differ about which one â€” it was either king [Agila](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agila_I) or his rival, [Athanagild](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanagild).

No matter who brought them in, they quickly found that the Byzantines intended to stay, which they did for another seventy years.
