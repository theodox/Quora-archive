Actually yes.

In antiquity, Seleucid emperor [Antiochus IV Epiphanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes) — he of Hannukah fame — was a Romanophile who outfitted part of his army in quasi-legionary style with chainmail and tower shields. These will have been legionaries more like those of the Punic war than than the ones familiar from later imagery, but they were presumably reasonably facsimiles of the Roman army: Antiochus grew up in Rome as a diplomatic hostage and so was quite familiar with legionary equipment (he also introduced gladiatorial shows to his domain, the first known example of a Greek state adopting them outside of Italy). There’s no record of the further career of Antiochus’ “legions” after his death — Roman-Seleucid relations soured after Antiochus died, so if nothing else his Romanizing aesthetic will have been unpopular. Some modern historians think that the [Thorakitai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorakitai) of other Hellenistic armies are also quasi-Roman, but that’s probably reading too much into visual similarities.

Much later, several Renaissance drew inspiration from the Roman legion, though none of them tried to recreate it in a literal sense (if nothing else, they didn’t have the archaeological expertise to really understand the actual nature of Roman equipment — until the 18th or 19th century Roman warfare was often depicted in ways that owe much more to 15th century arms and armor than the first).

The most famous experiment is [Machiavelli’s attempt to create a citizen militia for Florence](http://www.worldhistory.biz/middle-ages/23966-soderini-machiavelli-s-militia-and-pisa.html) modelled, at least in part, on the example of the citizen armies of the Roman Republic.

Roman thinking also influenced many other armies of the pike-and-short era: the checkerboard “quincunx” formation was at least superficially similar to Roman models.

In the 15th and 16th century the Roman manual of [Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Flavius_Vegetius_Renatus)was quite popular with military audiences — although it’s actually post-legionary, being written in the fourth or fifth century with an romanticised and nostalgic attitude towards the armies of the Republic and early empire. Maurice of Nassau, for example, seems to have chosen his 500-man battalion size based on Vegetius. However the overall environment was quite different — whatever the prestige of Roman arms in the literary sphere the armies of the early modern era were intensely aware of the difference that gunpowder and heavy cavalry made to the battlefield.
