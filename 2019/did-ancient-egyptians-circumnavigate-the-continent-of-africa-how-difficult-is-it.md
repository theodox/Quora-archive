Strictly speaking, the ancient Egyptians appear to have _paid other people_  to circumnavigate Africa.. The classic account of the story is in [Herodotus 4.42](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/4b*.html):

> As for [Africa]* clearly it is encompassed by sea, save only where it borders on Asia; and this was proved first (as far as we know) by Necos king of Egypt. He, when he had made an end of digging the canal which leads from the Nile to the Arabian Gulf, sent Phoenicians in ships, charging them to sail on their return voyage past the Pillars of Heracles till they should come into the northern sea and so to Egypt.

> So, the Phoenicians set out from the Red Sea and sailed the southern sea; whenever autumn came they would put in and sow the land, to whatever part of [Africa] they might come, and there await the harvest; then, having gathered in the crop, they sailed on, so that after two years had passed, it was in the third that they rounded the Pillars of Heracles and came to Egypt. There they said (what some may believe, though I do not) that in sailing round [Africa] they had the sun on their right hand.

The Greek original always says ‘Libya’ rather than ‘Africa’ — Africa is a Latin word that had not yet come into use when this was written. By “Pillars of Hercules” Herodotus means what we would call the Straits of Gibraltar in the Mediterranean. “Necos” is pharoah [Necho II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necho_II), who reigned from 610 to 595 BC: the voyage presumably happened happened right around 600 BC — a bit more than a century before Herodotus wrote about it.

This is the only mention of the story in any ancient source, so it has to be treated with a bit of caution. In antiquity this tale was widely criticized because of the detail in the last sentence: the fact that the Phoenician crews, sailing around the Cape of Good Hope, saw the sun on their right side as they headed west. When Herodotus wrote (and for a long time thereafter) no Greek had ever ventured south of the equator and so the idea that the sun would be visible in the northern rather than the southern half of the sky seemed like a fairy tale. Of course the sun does actually appear in the northern half of the sky when you’re in the southern hemisphere, so this detail is the strongest reason for believing the account to be true.

Unfortunately this very bare account is all we have to work with. However it does give a good idea of why this trip was never repeated. Ancient ships, driven by oar-power, did not have the cargo capacity to supply a large crew with food and water for a long voyage. Stopping to plant crops and waiting for them to grow is not a very efficient way to travel. Without a very valuable cargo waiting at the far end, the effort was all out of proportion to the reward, so (as far as we know) the trip was not repeated for almost two thousand years.
