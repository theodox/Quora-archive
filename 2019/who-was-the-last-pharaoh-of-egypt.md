Depends on how you define “last.”

The last native Egyptian pharaoh was [Nectanebo II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectanebo_II) (360–342 BC)

The last ruler of an independent Egypt was [Cleopatra VII](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra) (51–30 BC). Her dynasty were Macedonians, not Egyptians, but they used the traditional titles and imagery of the pharaohs in front of their Egyptian subjects.

After the Roman conquest in 30 BC, [Roman emperors retained the title of pharaohs as a concession to Egyptian sensibilities](https://theeducationalblog.quora.com/Imperator-at-home-Pharaoh-abroad-Roman-emperors-in-Egypt) down until about the beginning of the fourth century. The last name that ever appears in the cartouche of a pharaoh is that of [Maximinus Daia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximinus_II) (308–313).
