# Why is Demosthenes' anti-Macedonian oration used so much by modern anti-Greek propaganda on Macedonia's Greekness, when Demosthenes himself said that Alexander the Great was Greek ("Alexander, who is a Greek") in pseudo-Callisthenes, chapter 2.4?

Well you know, if you really want to follow what Pseudo-Callisthenes says about Alexander’s birth then __Alexander is an Egyptian__ .

He’s the son of Nectanebos, the last pharaoh, who [conned Olympias into sleeping with him in order to conceive a child with him who would avenge the Egyptians on the Persians.](http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander1a.html)

> And immediately she gave [Nectanebos] another room there close to her chamber. And he prepared the softest fleece of a ram together with the horns from its head, and a staff and a white robe. And he made a serpent, and he made it soft and limp; and it slithered out of his hands. All of a sudden he set the serpent loose and it entered Olympias' bedroom. Now when all the events described had occurred, the queen had no fear, but courageously endured the transformation of the god. And she bid those who were there to go away, each to his own place. And she reclined on the bed and covered her face; only out of the corner of her eye did she see him assuming the appearance which she saw in the dream. And he put aside the date-tree wood staff, got up onto the bed and turned Olympias toward him and mated with her. And he, when he arose from her, smote her belly and said: "O child, remain forever unconquered, supreme!" With these words, he went away to his own time of waiting. And the future took its course: she rejoiced because she had been embraced by a serpent, Ammon, Heracles, Dionysus, all divine.

Ps.-Callisthenes, _[Alexander Romance 1.7](http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander1a.html#7)_ . Greek text [here](http://www.attalus.org/greek/alexander1a.html#7).

There is a reason the author in question is _Pseudo_ -Callisthenes. He’s not the historian who accompanied Alexander to Persia; he’s the author of the [Alexander Romance](http://www.attalus.org/info/alexander.html), a fantasy mashup of Alexander’s career that includes Alexander traipsing through China, hanging around with deceased pharoahs, exchanging letters with the Amazons, and sweet-talking the queen of Ethiopia. It bears about the same relationship to the history of the Argeads as _Asterix_  does to the life of Caesar.

_Nectanebo, dressed up as Ammon, sleeping with Olympias. The_ Alexander Romance_was the most popular version of the Alexander story in the Middle Ages._ 

Are you sure you want to use that for evidence?
