Roman tradition was rather similar to early modern Europe: while _having_  money was respected, _earning_  money was not a high status occupation. "Trade" -- whether it was business or technical pursuits -- was not socially respected; if you were a gentleman you lived off your rents as a landowner, did public service as a politician, or served in the military (the distinctions between these were fuzzy anyway: there were property qualifications for different offices and grades of citizenship. The military was tied to property qualifications before the [Marian reforms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_reforms), but afterwards was more professionalized; however the upper ranks (like those of the British services before the first World War) were dominated by the gentry as well. 

Any other occupation was lower status. Working with you hands was particularly low-status: little social prestige was attached to craftsmanship or technical ingenuity. 

As [Endrick Kreuter](https://www.quora.com/profile/Endrick-Kreuter) points out, most skilled occupations had a large slave contingent, which tended to create negative associations for artisanal and technical occupations. It was possible for highly skilled slaves to achieve some degree of notoriety and wealth; Roman moralists love to complain about nouveaux-riche former slaves such as [Trimalchio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimalchio) who made a lot of money doing "grubby" work and became rich enough to socialize with more distinguished members of the traditional elite. Legal servile status did not necessarily translate into completely bottom of the barrel social status: a valuable, well informed confidant like [Marcus Tullius Tiro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Tullius_Tiro), Cicero's right hand man, was far better connected (and probably better housed, clothed and fed) than a farmer from the provinces. S

Some specialties were better respected than others. In late Republican and Imperial Rome, artists and sculptors were regarded much more highly than, say, stonemasons or bricklayers. Aristocrats might take these up as hobbies, much as they did with poetry or philosophy, although doing this to earn your living pretty much guaranteed you were not a "gentleman". In some situations this was like the Italian Renaissance, where the majority of working craftsmen had low status but famous artists with high-status patrons enjoyed privileged access to the elite.
