There’s no referee who’s going to settle this one fairly.

However, the Persians inherited the titulature of the old Babylonian empire, which itself was largely cadged from the Assyrians, who in turn stole it from the empire of Sargon. This meant that Cyrus, for example, described himself like this to his Babylonian subjects:

> I am Cyrus, king of the world, great king, mighty king, king of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four quarters of the world….

“king of the world” is actually _modest,_ since the Assyrians sometimes used “[king of everything](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-pharaoh-of-Egypt-or-other-ancient-rulers-espouse-a-similar-universal-monarchy-ambition-as-later-emperors-in-Rome-and-China/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=305317859&share=1f931202&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer).” On the other hand, in Persian they stuck with the comparatively modest “king of kings”:

> great king, king of kings, the king of Persia, the king of countries

By comparison, the first century or two of Roman emperors were pretty coy about titles, “Caesar” [was actually a handy euphemism](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Caesar-come-to-mean-emperor-Why-did-all-Roman-emperors-call-themselves-Caesar-of-Rome/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=85397327&share=fff5fa67&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer), allowing early emperors to play the role, albeit rather unconvincingly, of “first among equals”. Even by the time the pretense was finally dropped the actual titulature was mostly a collection of adjectives and (often spurious) victory accolades:

> Commander Caesar Flavius Constantine, pious, fortunate, victorious and triumphant, emperor, chief priest, four-time great victor over the Germans, twice great victor over the Goths, great victor over the Dacians, with 33 years of tribunician powers, eight times consul, 32 years acclaimed commander, father of this country

Not a bad resume, mind you, but “king of the four quarters of the world” is a bit more impressive.



__Bonus Round:__ If you want to get pissy about it you try to note that the last King of the Universe was [Antiochus I Soter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_I_Soter). But his great-great-grandson (and nephew several times over — it’s complicated) Antiochus IV is Seleucid king who was forced to stop his army and go home when a Roman senator drew the famous “line in the sand” at his feet — so there might be some element of title inflation you would want to factor in.



__Bonus Round 2:__ For most of the six or seven hundred years that Rome and Parthia, then Rome and Sassanid Persia were rivals, diplomatic protocol treated them as equals; if we can trust [the letter which is supposed to have been written by Constantine to Shapur II, ](https://biblehub.com/library/theodoret/the_ecclesiastical_history_of_theodoret/chapter_xxiv_letter_written_by_the.htm)“my brother” was an appropriate address. Generally relations in peacetime were on an equal footing, though peacetimes could be quite far apart.



Final verdict: _Tie_
