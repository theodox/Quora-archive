Not really.

The rise and fall of different powers in the region caused the political boundaries to shift back and forth a good deal: for example, Philip II of Macedon subdued most of Thrace, but the Macedonians were gone again in less than a hundred years. Several Greek cities of the north Aegean and Black Sea coasts were periodically subjugated to their Thracian neighbors. Most of the historic Thrace lies outside the borders of modern Greece.

_The area labeled “Odrisios” the fifth century BC kingdom of the Odrysseans, the most powerful of the Thracian kingdoms. This map reflects the situation around the time of the Peloponessian war. Most of this area would later be conquered by Philip of Macedon — but a new Thracian kingdom would emerge again a century or so later.

There was a good deal of commerce and cultural interchange as well as warfare: the most characteristic example was [Seuthopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seuthopolis), a Greek-sounding city but one founded by Thracian king [Seuthes III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seuthes_III) — it had a mixed population and hosted famous workshops in which eminently Greek-looking art was produced for the king and his court by a mix of Greek and Thracian artisans. The Thracians had their own language but they used Greek for writing; unfortunately we don’t have many Thracian texts apart from short inscriptions.

Greeks and Thracians were quite aware of their ethnic differences. Greeks stereotyped their Thracian neighbors as unruly and unsophisticated. Red hair and blue eyes were regarded as common Thracian traits. Thracian mercenaries were common on Greek battlefields and Thracian slaves were familiar in Greek cities; in Greek comedies _Thratta_ or “Thracian Girl”, is a stereotypical slave name.
