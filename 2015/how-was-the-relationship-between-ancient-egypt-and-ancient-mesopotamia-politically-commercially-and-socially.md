There were several different phases. 

In the early history of both regions contact was fairly limited -- long distance trade definitely occurred but primarily through long chains of intermediaries rather than directly . Land communications generally passed through modern day Syria, where the coastal route from Egypt and the Euphrates river run come closest -- then as now the Syrian Desert was a formidable obstacle; Camels would not be domesticated for another 1000 years). 

There might have seaborne, coastwise trade as well: some people think that the land of _Magan_  mentioned in records of king Sargon (mid 23d century BC) is Egypt, although that's debated; the Egyptians did sail the Red Sea, but it was enough of a special expedition that Egyptian Pharoahs felt compelled to brag about their occasional expeditions to the "land of [Punt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilmun)" (which might include southern Arabia and potentially the Persian Gulf trade center of [Dilmun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilmun), but might instead be the Horn of Africa. 

Because communications were difficult, really regular contact between Egypt and Mesopotamia really didn't start until late -- a good ballpark date would be in the 21st century BC, when both civilizations were already over a thousand years old (this would correspond to the Egyptian [Middle Kingdom ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt) and the [Old AssyrianKingdom](http://Old AssyrianKingdom) periods). In this period peoples like the [Hurrian](http://Hurrian)s and the [Amorites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoriteswere) were key intermediaries, becoming wealthy and influential in their own right by controlling both the east-west trade from the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia and the north-south trade coming down from Asia Minor. The Amorites eventually became powerful enough to establish themselves as rulers in many Mesopotamian cities down until the 16th c. BC ; one side effect of this was to inject a more commercial outlook into Mesopotamian culture. The native groups who overthrew the Amorites -- including the states that would become Bablyon and Assyria -- were much more outward looking and engaged in more trade with distant regions.

The 'golden age' of Egyptian-Mesopotamian interchange saw frequent trade, diplomatic interchanges, and occasional warfare; it corresponds to what's usually called the [Late Bronze Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age#Age_sub-divisions) The politics was fairly confusing as middlemen and clients came and went but basically the period from the 16th to 12th centuries BC was a 3-way contest for influence between Egypt, a succession of Mesopotamian powers (Assyria and Babylon) and the [Hittites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittites). In the middle were a number of client states whose allegiances came and went. and (for a while) the powerful [Mitanni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitanni) kingdom which played a great-power role for a while. 

During this period armies from all 3 sides criss-crossed the middle ground of Syria -- the Egyptians got as far north as southern Turkey, the Hittites as far south as Lebanon, and the Assyrians briefly reached the shores of the Mediterranean. 

No one, however, was able to establish a lasting lead. Warfare was not continuous, there was more commonly a complex balance of power. This fostered a lot of diplomacy, primarily between the big powers and the many smaller kingdoms and cities in the middle; we know quite a lot about these interchanges because we have copies of treaties and diplomatic exchanges; the [Ugarit Letters](https://books.google.com/books?id=NrGBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA215&lpg=PA215&dq=ugarit+letters&source=bl&ots=TIvy-iVkBZ&sig=YLEtZuxp1SXnXBRsJgJLRY7SMVE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WB9iVdeDFMOtogTWuYGADw&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=ugarit%20letters&f=false), for example, are a great window into the diplomacy and trade going on in the prosperous coastal trading city of Ugarit. We know that, for example, how the Egyptians and Hittites arranged a dynastic marriage to patch up relations after the [Battle of Kadesh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kadesh) (see [Egyptianâ€“Hittite peace treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%E2%80%93Hittite_peace_treaty)). Different small powers switched sides and played the big powers off against each other; the big powers constantly realigned against anyone who seemed to be achieving predominance. 

Throughout this period trade flourished; despite the frequent wars the Syrian middle ground had many wealthy cities like [Mari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari,_Syria), [Ebla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebla), [Aleppo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo#Pre-history_and_pre-classical_era) and Ugarit. The common language of trade (the common written language, at any rate) was [Akkadian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_languagea) , a Semitic Mesopotamian language written in cuneiform on clay tablets. Trade was still difficult and expensive, so it was dominated by irreplaceable commodities (the tin needed for making bronze, for example) or highly profitable luxury goods. 

This relatively open, highly inter-woven world lasted from the end of the Amorite period down to the [Late Bronze Age collapse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse), when a series of calamities -- environmental, economic, and military -- destroyed the Hittite Empire and sowed chaos in Egypt and Mesopotamia, disrupting trade and diplomacy for centuries.

When the Near East recovered from the disasters of the 12th century, Egypt and the [Neo-Assyrian Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire) resumed their long rivalry. The Assyrians, generally, had the upper hand militarily (their reputation as fierce conquerors comes through quite clearly in all ancient sources, including the Bible The 'middle ground' was still divided into spheres of influence but the Iron Age version of the great power game was played with bigger, more powerful armies and longer reach; the Assyrians eventually invade Egypt under [Esarhaddon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esarhaddon) in 673 and placed their own puppet Pharoah on the throne in 664. 

However Assyrians were unpopular conquerors, and their subjects in Bablyon allied with the [Medes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medes) and the Egyptians to overthrow the Assyrians with remarkable speed. Assyria was replaced by Babylon as the leading Mesopotamian power in 605, but very soon thereafter the Persians would conquer all, enfolding both Egypt and Mesopotamia into their vast empire by 525 and ending the independent history of both cultures.
