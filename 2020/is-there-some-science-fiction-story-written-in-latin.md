In Latin, the closest you’d come is probably the “[dream of Scipio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnium_Scipionis),” an episode in book VI of Cicero’s _[De Republica](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/54161/54161-h/54161-h.htm)_ _._ In it a fictionalized version of Scipio Aemilianus recounts a dream he had in which he has a vision of the way the solar system works. He’s transported high into the heavens, where he sees the concentric rings which carry the planets and and the sun in their orbits around the earth (needless to say, this is a geocentric universe). Scipio learns the vanity of human ambitions by seeing the globe from outer space: the empires and kingdoms which defined his life are not even visible against the vastness of the universe.

It’s an interesting imaginative exploration of a very different cosmology than our own. A version of the story, along with [a philosophical commentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrobius), was a standard text in the Middle Ages. The “Dream” formed the basis for artistic representations of “outer space” for the next millennium and a half. If you’ve ever seen footnotes to Dante, Shakespeare or Milton with explaining ideas like “the music of the spheres” or “the great chain of being,” those go back ultimately to Cicero and Macrobius.

_The ‘music of the spheres’ maps the periodicity of the planets (arranged at right, in order from earth at the “bottom” or center of the universe) onto an idealized set of harmonized proportions. Interestingly this medieval illustration puts Apollo in the place of God, beyond the outermost sphere of fixed stars which marked the edge of the universe._ 

There’s a great discussion of the impact of Scipio’s dream on Medieval imaginations in C.S. Lewis’s non-fiction handbook for students of Medieval literature, [The Discarded Image](https://amzn.to/3fnqgzy).

In Greek, there’s also [A True Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_True_Story) by Lucian of Samosata, which takes its hero on a journey to the moon. Lucian is a humorist and his tale operates on rather less exalted emotional pitch, but it does show some amazingly twisted humorous imaginings. Many of these are sly parodies of contemporary trends in Greek philosophy… others are just nuts.
