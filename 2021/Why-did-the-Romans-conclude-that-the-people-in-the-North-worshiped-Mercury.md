This is just an example — slightly more obtuse than some, but hardly unusual — of what’s known as the _[interpretatio Romana](https://oxfordre.com/classics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-3303)_ _:_  the ancient habit of assuming that other people’s deities were essentially the same as your own, despite superficial differences or ritual, appearance or role.

The _interpretatio,_ along with it’s Greek alter-ego the _[interpretatio Graeca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretatio_graeca)_ _,_ attempted to map a foreign deity onto a familiar one as a way of rendering an otherwise alien though process more approachable. Some of these identifications are so widespread that they became self-fulfilling prophecies: there’s good archaeological and literary evidence that the identifications between Italian deities and their Greek rivals solidified so much over time that the identity between the two became an established fact: the well known Olympian gods (Zeus, Hera, Athena and so on) became entirely synonymous with their Roman counterparts (Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva) in ways which affected both sets of cults over time.

The process of deciding how to map one god onto another was anything but systematic. It’s quite common to find different authors providing conflicting “interpretations” of the same foreign cult. It was even more complex because it was often a kind of bi-directional negotiation between cultures: a foreigner might just as easily adopt a particular identification as a point of contact: not all of the mappings originated with the a Greek or a Roman.

Being so haphazard, there was not necessarily a consistent logic underlying the identification. You might link one deity to another based on their political position within the pantheon: my “king of the gods” and yours might be assumed to be the same even if mine is a sky-and-storm (Jupiter and Zeus) and yours is a transcendant creator god (Egyptian [Amun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amun#Identification_with_Min_and_Ra)) or a solar god (Amun-Re). On the other hand you might find the link in function: my god who embodies the destructive nature of war (Greek Ares) equates to your god of peace-through-strength (Roman Mars). However iconography could also provide a link even when the theologies were quite distinct: Ares/Mars was usually linked to Babylonian [Nergal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nergal), whose primary role was generally as a god of the underworld, because he was often depicted with weapons. On the other hand a subset of Nergal imagery focused on a club-like mace, which led to an alternate identification with Heracles/Hercules.

In the specific case of Mercury, the equation is a particularly complex. It arises in the context of a Roman world that already had a pre-existing four-way connection between Roman Mercury, Greek Hermes, Egyptian Thoth, and Babylonian Nabu. Mercury and Hermes shared a connection to commerce; Hermes and Thoth shared a connection to writing; Thoth and Nabu shared a connection to “secret knowledge” and magic.

When the Romans encountered Germanic religion, they did so primarily in the larger context of the widespread Celtic cultures of Gaul and central Europe. The chief god of the Celtic pantheon was (usually) [Lugus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugus) — a god known for esoteric wisdom and also for his patronage of trade and crafts. Despite playing a theo-political role that might seem like a better match for Jupiter/Zeus, the Romans, Greeks and Celts seem to have settled on a match between Hermes/Mercury and Lugus.

The Germanic tribes who lived in or just beyond the Celtic cultural zone in Gaul and central Europe had their own form of _interpretatio_ which mapped their own deities onto Celtic ones. In that relationship, the deity we usually know as [Odin ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin)(common to many Germanic groups) was identified with Lugus. Which meant, of course, that Odin became Lugus became Mercury.

_Many Roman-era Gallic artworks, like this one from the Musée Archéologique de Dijon, include two birds quite suspiciously like Odin’s ravens. Ravens also figure in some Irish stories about Lugh, a variant of Lugus._ 

There’s a more detailed recounting of this particular identification here:



This mythological shell game is not exactly social science at it’s most perceptive. On the other hand, our own persistent efforts to find evidence of modern political and ideological presuppositions in other people’s cultures aren’t really a lot more rigorous or coherent. It’s easy to find moderns who see the Egypt of the Pharaohs as a socialist worker’s paradise, as a benighted priest-ridden rabble, as a Stalinist dystopia, or as the expression of a pristine racial consciousness — all interpretations that say a lot more about us than they do about ancient Egypt.
