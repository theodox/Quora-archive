There’s plenty of literary and even a little bit of pictorial evidence for blondism and redheads in ancient Greece and Rome, though it was rare enough to be worthy of comment.

__Greece__ 

In Greece, the most famous literary example is Achilles, who is described as _xanthos ξανθός,_ which is roughly “tawny” (ie, more Brad Pitt than Dolph Lundgren); his son Neoptolemus was also known as _Pyrrhus_ , πυρρός — literally “flaming” but figuratively “redheaded”.

Among the gods, those described as blondes include Apollo, Eros, Demeter, and Aphrodite, and occasionally Dionysus. It might be worth pointing out in passing that this would make four or five out of the twelve Olympians blonde — a percentage on a par with the modern Czech republic. That’s highly unlikely to be a representative percentage for antiquity, it probably reflects social cachet connected to fair hair in the period when Greek myths assumed their canonical forms.

In the historic realm Alexander the Great was also a _xanthos;_ his mother Olympias was a redhead — she was part of the Aeacid royal family of Epirus, which descent from the original Pyrrhus. Or, on a less political level, there are things like this bit from the [poems of Sappho](http://www.projethomere.com/ressources/Sappho/Poetry-of-Sappho.pdf) [LP 98]:

> for my mother said that when she was a girl if you bound the locks of your hair in back, gathered there in a circlet of plaited purple, that was truly a fine adornment, but for blondes with hair yellower than a torch it is better to fasten it with fresh garlands of flowers in bloom

Interestingly, lighter hair colors seem to have become exoticised in historic times. By the classical era, the typical redhead in Greek eyes was a Thracian or a Scythian — the female form of _Pyrrhu_ s is _Pyrrha_ , and it is shorthand in Greek comedy for a female slave, assumed to be a Thracian. _Xanthias_ , “Blondie”, is a common male slave name. The Greeks also stereotyped the Gauls (both in what’s now France and in the Balkans) as redheaded and pale skinned. So one could hypothesize that by the time Greece was literate, lighter hair colors appeared more unusual than they had during the pre-literate era when Homer and a lot of the myths took shape. On the other hand, the names _Kasato_ (for _ξανθός)_ and _Pyrrwhias_  (for πυρρός) show up in Mycenaean Linear-B tablets so fair-haired people must have been at least occasionally known as far back as, say, the 14th century BC or so.

In historic times there seems to be more blondism in the areas where northwest-Greek dialects were spoken — Epirus and Macedonia. These areas, perhaps not coincidentally, bordered on Illyria and Thrace where blondes or redheads were regarded by Greeks as fairly common. As Xenophanes said, “Men make gods in their own image; those of the Ethiopians are black and snub-nosed, those of the Thracians have blue eyes and red hair.”

So it might not be necessary to invoke migrations, at least not after the Bronze Age. It may just be a case of a north-south cline in the distribution of blondism, similar to what we see in Italy (and even, to a lesser degree, in Greece and the Balkans) today.

The movement of peoples within Greece during the ‘Greek Dark Ages’ which followed the collapse of Mycenaean civilization is not well understood, so all discussions of migrations have to be speculative. For a long time scholars saw traditional stories like the so-called “[Return of the Heraclidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracleidae)” as evidence for a mass-movement of peoples similar to the age of migrations at the end of the Roman empire; nowadays [this picture is less widely accepted, but it’s not entirely clear what we can put in its place.](https://www.quora.com/Was-there-an-ancient-race-of-people-inhabiting-Greece-before-the-Ancient-Greeks-came-along)

__Rome__ 

It seems that the gradual cline you see in modern Italy, where blondes are fairly common in the north and rare by the toe of the “boot”, goes back at least as far as the fifth century BC and possibly as much as a thousand years before that. What the Romans called “Gallia Cisalpina” or “Gaul on this side of the alps” was inhabited by people they knew as _Galli,_ relatives of the Gauls of France and the northern Balkans. A Greek historian described them this way:

> The Gauls are tall of body, with rippling muscles, and white of skin, and their hair is blond, and not only naturally so, but they make it their practice to increase the distinguishing color by which nature has given it. For they are always washing their hair in limewater, and they pull it back from their forehead to the top of the head and back to the nape of the neck... Some of them shave their beards, but others let it grow a little; and the nobles shave their cheeks, but they let the mustache grow until it covers the mouth.

Diodorus Siculus, V.28

The Romans generally contrasted their own appearance with that of their neighbors to the north, who were seen as taller and fairer. However there are plenty of examples of Romans who were fair-haired as well. Nicknames like _flavus (_ “blondie”)_, canus (_ “whitey”)_,_ and _rufus (_ “ginger”) and _ahenobarbus_ (“redbeard”) were fairly common. The best example is emperor Augustus, who was described this way:

> his hair was slightly curly and inclining to golden; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair.

Suetionius _Divus Augustus_  79

The infamous Nero was also a blonde, although one with a terrible pimply complexion. The poet Horace had a mistress he called Pyrrha — like any educated Roman, he knew Greek and was probably referring to her as a redhead though we can’t be sure.

As in Greece, the majority of the population were darker haired. We do have more than a couple of complaints by Roman moralists about the vogue for blonde wigs and dyes among Roman women; the satirist Martial said of one woman “Her toilet table contained a hundred lies, and while she was in Rome, her hair was blushing by the Rhine” The second century the Christian moralist Tertullian described Roman women as “ashamed of their country, sorry that they were not born in Germany or in Gaul. As far as their hair is concerned, they give up their country.”

Again as in Greece, there’s reason to think that the distribution of hair color isn’t monolithic but it does go back pretty far. It generally doesn’t stem from the impact of migrations in historic times.
