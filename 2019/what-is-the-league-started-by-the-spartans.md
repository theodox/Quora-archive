That’s the [Peloponnesian League](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/peloponnesian-league/) — a modern name, however. In Greek it would have been the generic Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ ξύμμαχοι, “the Spartans and the allies”, which better reflects the reality of Spartan hegemony. Although the grouping did in fact have a few permanent institutions it was always a Spartan-centric alliance which sometimes intervened in the affairs of “allied” states to make sure pro-Spartan factions remained on top.

After the defeat of Xerxes in 480, many Greek states formed an alliance in order to carry the fight to the Persians. Modern historians refer to that as the “Hellenic League.” It’s far from clear if it was seen at the time as an expansion of the old “Spartans and their allies” or a new institution altogether; in its early days the new league was formed with the expectation of Spartan leadership. However, unlike the earlier league it was more of an alliance of equals and it included states from outside Sparta’s traditional home turf.

The homebody Spartans quickly lost their taste for fighting in Asia Minor. Within a couple of years the the Athenians assumed the leadership of the Hellenic League without them. They moved the official meeting place of the league to the island of Delos, whence it gets its modern name as the [Delian League.](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/delian-league/) Sparta and her Peloponessian allies remained aloof.

In just over a decade the Peloponessian and Delian fragments of the short-lived Hellenic league were at war: the [First Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Peloponnesian_War) pitted the Spartans and their allies against the Athenians and theirs. It was a dress-rehearsal for the final showdown, the generation of warfare that split Greece down the middle from 430 to 404.
