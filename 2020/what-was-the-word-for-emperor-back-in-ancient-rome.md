In Latin it was _imperator,_ which roughly translates to ‘commander’. Before there was an empire, it was customary for a victorious army to hail its leader as an _imperator —_ it was a big compliment — and the early emperors [adopted this as a way of disguising their power.](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-word-%E2%80%9CEmperor%E2%80%9D-derived-from-Caesar-in-so-many-languages-when-the-Roman-Emperors-were-called-%E2%80%9CAugusti%E2%80%9D/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=e8d1d6f8&srid=zLvM)

_Caesar,_ which was the family nickname of Julius Caesar’s family, gradually turned from a name into a title. Augustus, the first emperor, was Caesar’s adopted son so he used it to emphasize his connection to Julius Caesar; his own adopted children used it to emphasize their connection to him. Within a century, emperors who had no connection to Caesar’s family at all were using it as a title; Vespasian, for example, had a senator killed for addressing him as “Vespasian” rather than as Caesar.

Eventually _Augustus,_ which was another on of those titles-by-acclamation (literally “a revered one” or “a wise and respected person”) morphed into a formal title too, so you’ll see a lot of coins with things like

_IMP[erator] CAES[ar] NERVA TRAIAN[us] AUG[ustus] GERM[anicus]_ 

where Trajan is a Caesar, an Augustus, and an imperator.

The Greek half of the empire was much simpler; you were an _autokrator_ , which was as close as they could come to “imperator”, or a _basileus_ , the king.
