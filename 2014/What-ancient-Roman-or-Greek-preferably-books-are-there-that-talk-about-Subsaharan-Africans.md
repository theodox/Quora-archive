There's not much discussion of what we'd call 'sub-saharan' Africa - contact between the mediterranean and western africa below the sahel was very limited. I think domesticated camels - the prerequisite for cross-saharan trade - aren't attested before Roman times. There is a lot of shaky info about the Horn of Africa, particularly Ethiopia.



Josephus, the Jewish historian, touches lightly on "the queen of sheba"

Manetho, a greco-egyptian, touches on Ethiopia as well

Diodorus has some material , I think a lot of it is rehashed herodotus

Strabo?

Sallust has some discussions of Numidia - Libya / Algeria / Tunisia

Pliny the Elder

Juba II, a king of Mauretania, wrote some natural history and travelogues in Greek. He's supposed to have discovered the Canary Islands.

Polybius is the source for my favorite story, Ptolemy's effort to domesticate African elephants to counter the Indian elephant monopoly of the Seleucids
