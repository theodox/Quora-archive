Thereâ€™s a famous story in [Suetonius ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#70)about how he defused a potentially dangerous mutiny in 47BC:

> Again at Rome, when the men of the Tenth clamored for their discharge and rewards with terrible threats and no little peril to the city, though the war in Africa was then raging, he did not hesitate to appear before them, against the advice of his friends, and to disband them. But with a single word, calling them _quirites_ ("citizens") instead of _milites_ ("soldiers") he easily brought them round and bent them to his will; for they at once replied that they were his "soldiers" and insisted on following him to Africa, although he refused their service. Even then he punished the most insubordinate by the loss of a third part of the booty and of the land intended for them.
