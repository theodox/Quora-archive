Latin is an [inflected language,](http://www.britannica.com/topic/inflection) which means it uses the endings of words to tell the hearer how a sentence functions. English mostly uses the position of words in a sentence to distinguish between the subject, object, indirect objects and so on. In Latin the same information is encoded in the endings of the nouns. 

All Latin nouns -- not just names -- use one of 5 sets of endings; without them a Roman could not make a meaningful sentence. A tiny vestige of this survives in English as the difference between _he, his,_ and _him --_ but mostly we've lost this grammatical function and replaced it with word order and prepositions.
