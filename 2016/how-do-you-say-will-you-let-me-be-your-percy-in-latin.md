The shortest version would be _Perseus tibi sim,_ which would be “May I be Perseus to you.” In Latin that _sim_  expresses hope and also a bit of uncertainty. If you want to emphasize the asking permission part, _sinās mihi Perseus tibi esse_ where _sinās_  is ‘would you allow…?’

Of course, if you’re going for the first series of books (and not the Roman themed __Heroes of Olympus__ ) you should do it in _Greek…_ which I think would be _εἴθε ἐᾷς με Περσεύς εἶναι σοί_ roughly pronounced_“ey-eete eyais may Perseoos ey-inai soy”_ 

_Helpful hint, you should be able to cut and paste the Greek into any program that takes unicode text (most do, these days)._ 

PS. It is surprisingly difficult to find first-date-appropriate _pictures_  of Perseus. You might want to use a nice Athena instead since she’s an Annabeth groupie.
