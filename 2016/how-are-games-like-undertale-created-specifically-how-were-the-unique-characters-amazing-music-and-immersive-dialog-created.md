As everybody says, it's a lot of work. As media go, games are one of the more labor intensive ones. But it's hardly impossible: my son finished his first game in GameMaker -- the same software used for UnderTale -- at age 9. One of the things I love about UT is that it really strips away all the flashy production values stuff that obscures the relationship between the game creator and the audience: it doesn't hide behind billions of bytes of shader code and normal maps.

If you have a world you want to invite people to, start messing around! For a UT-esque 2d game you can also short circuit some of the tech hurdles with a 2-d scanner (under $200 or so), paper, and paint, pencils or crayons.
