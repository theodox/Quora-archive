It wasn’t. The idea of “Greece” is a modern lens we apply to a rather different ancient reality.

It would actually be quite hard to ask an ancient Greek “what country are you from?” — there’s not really a single word that corresponds to the way we use country in English. You could ask “what _city_  are you from?” and they’d get that; you could also ask “where are you from” in a geographical sense. But the thing which, say, an Athenian and a Spartan saw as their common heritage was language and a set of social norms — not a political union.

This doesn’t mean the Greeks didn’t have a strong group self-consciousness. They talked about “Greeks” (or more precisely, “Hellenes” — Greek is what the Romans called them) all the time. But being a Hellene was a cultural and linguistic identity rather than a political one. You might compare it to modern umbrella-identities like “Arab” or “Hispanic,” both of which include a lot of linguistic and cultural identification without reference to nation-states. When an ancient Greek said “Hellas” — the word we use today for the modern country of Greece — you’d have to listen to context of figure out if they were referring to “the entire Greek-speaking world from the Black Sea to Spain”, “mainland Greece south of Macedonia”, or “Boeotia, Thessaly, Aetolia and Phocis.”

Apart from a few starry-eyed idealists (like [Isocrates](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Isocrates)) and some well-armed cynics (like [Philip of Macedon](https://www.ancient.eu/Philip_II_of_Macedon/)) the idea that “all Greeks should form a political community” operated on about the same level of reality as the idea of “One World Government” does today — ie, either a wistful dream or a conspiracy theory, depending on who you talk to. There was _never_ a time when all the Greek speakers of antiquity belonged to a single government; the closest they ever came was under the Roman empire but even then there were substantial Greek communities in Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, and Afghanistan.
