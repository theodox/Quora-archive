# If you can read ancient Greek literature, was the word barbarian pejorative? Or just neutrally meaning they couldn't make sense of the sounds of the language these people spoke?

It’s a bit of both — Greek usage was not entirely consistent on this point, something that Greeks occasionally pointed out to each other.

Probably the most notable exponent of the negative view — the idea that βάρβαροι were, in our sense, “barbaric” — is Aristotle, who infamously declared that “[barbarians] are a community of slaves.” A good contrast would be someone like Herodotus, who was intensely interested in “barbarian” cultures like Persia and Egypt, whose virtues and achievements he was happy to record.

The ambiguity was hard to escape. Aristotle’s other pull-quote was “that is why the poets say it is meet for Greeks to rule over barbarians” — but he’s referring to [a line which Euripides put into the mouth of Iphigenia,](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0108%3Acard%3D1374) who is in the act of volunteering to be sacrificed on an altar in the most primitive of rituals, precisely the kind of “barbarism” Greeks affected to despise in others. And of course Aristotle himself, although he used Greek as a synonym for “politically advanced” and barbarian for “primitive” also wrote a book praising the constitution of barbarian Carthage. The interplay between the cultural-suprematist version and the purely linguistic one is the crux of a famous story about [Pyrrhus of Epirus](http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/pyrrhus.html), confronted for the first time on the battlefield of Heraclea in 280 BC:

> he rode up to take a view of them, and seeing their order, the appointment of the watches, their method and the general form of their encampment, he was amazed, and addressing one of his friends next to him: "This order," said he, "Megacles, of the barbarians, is not at all barbarian in character; we shall see presently what they can do

As time went on and more and more non-Greeks adopted Greek as a language of culture and business the situation got only more complex.

For example the satirist [Lucian of Samosata](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/l/lucian/works/complete.html#introduction) , despite his excellent classical credentials, was a Syrian and well aware of his marginal status in the Greek literary world of the Roman empire. Here he addresses the goddess of Philosophy in terms that seem to make light of ethnic or cultural ideas about barbarism:

> I am a Syrian from the Euphrates, my lady. But is the question relevant? Some of my accusers I know to be as much barbarians by blood as myself; but character and culture do not vary as a man comes from Soli or Cyprus, Babylon or Stagira. However, even one who could not talk Greek would be none the worse in your eyes, so long as his sentiments were right and just.

However he also makes a lot of jokes about the relations between Greeks and barbarians — the kind of jokes that outsiders often make against themselves to forestall jokes of the same kind made by insiders: not the kind of jokes you’d expect if “barbarian” were an entirely neutral usage in practice.

Another example is [Flavius Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus), a Jew with a tragic history. He was a Roman collaborator in the Jewish War, and lived out his life as a privileged POW in Rome, attached to the Flavian court. His historical works have a [strong undertone of bitterness](https://www.quora.com/How-Jewish-are-Philo-and-Josephus-in-their-writing), trying to use Greek literature to defend the reputation of the Jews against the virulent antisemitism of the first century — here again the technical and the pejorative meanings of “barbarian” are inextricably entwined in the usage of a single writer. Interestingly, as a Roman ally Josephus doesn’t just distinguish between Greeks and barbarians — he’s also very eager to distinguish between Romans and Greeks, since he earned his salt from the Roman state.

So the answer is really that there’s no single answer: as a boundary-defining term, βάρβαρος was slippery — as boundaries often are.
