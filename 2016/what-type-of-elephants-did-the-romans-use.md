In the Hellenistic period (the 250 years or so following Alexander's the Great's death in 323 BC), access to elephants became a big concern for the various Greek kingdoms that emerged from the fragments of Alexander's empire. During Alexander's eastward march he Greeks had [learned the hard way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Hydaspes) that India was well-supplied with trained, domesticated elephants. The Seleucid Empire, which occupied Alexander's easternmost territories, bordered on India and monopolized access to these coveted animals..

This strategic advantage was deeply resented by the rival Ptolemaic kingdom of Egypt, which started an [ambitious "wonder weapon" program to domesticate and train African elephants.](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-historical-fact-you-know-off-the-top-of-your-head/answer/Steve-Theodore) The Ptolemies sent well-funded expeditions to Nubia and Eritrea to capture the animals, and built specially designed transports to bring them back to a training center in Egypt staffed by smuggled-in Indian mahouts. Most scholars think these were the now-extinct _Loxodonta africana pharaoensis, though_ others think they were _Loxodonta africana._ 

Whatever species the program turned out to be a boondoggle. Although the African elephants were more or less brought to heel they were unable to stand up to the Indian variety -- at the [Battle of Raphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Raphia) in 217 BC the Egyptian elephant corps stampeded and fled the battlefield. It's not unlikely that the elephant corps of Hannibal was made up of cast-offs from the abandoned Ptolemaic elephant program.

So one possibility is that Claudius' elephant was descended from the Egyptian breeding program.

 Another, though, is that once elephants were no longer seen as a critical military advantage the overland trade loosened up and the well-developed elephant industry in India supplied the Romans via the overland route. It's also possible that the well developed [ Indian-Roman sea trade](https://www.quora.com/I-have-heard-that-ancient-Greece-and-Rome-were-having-trades-with-south-Indian-kingdoms-But-in-history-why-werent-these-given-much-importance-and-not-talked-about) brought elephants: the centre of the Indian Ocean trade, Berenike on the Red Sear, was originally founded by the Ptolemies to support their elephant hunts in Aden. 

A late source ([Polyaenus) ](http://www.attalus.org/translate/polyaenus8A.html)describes Julius Caesar using an elephant against Cassivellaunus like this:

> 
5 [# ](http://www.attalus.org/bc1/year54.html#29) When Caesar's passage over a large river in [Britain](http://www.attalus.org/names/b/britain.html#1) was disputed by the British king [Cassivellaunus](http://www.attalus.org/names/c/cassivellaunus.html#1), at the head of a strong body of cavalry and a great number of chariots, he ordered an elephant, an animal till then unknown to the Britons, to enter the river first, mailed in scales of iron, with a tower on its back, on which archers and slingers were stationed. If the Britons were terrified at so extraordinary a spectacle, what shall I say of their horses? Amongst the Greeks, the horses fly at the sight of an unarmed elephant; but armoured, and with a tower on its back, from which missiles and stones are continually hurled, it is a sight too formidable to be borne. The Britons accordingly with their cavalry and chariots abandoned themselves to flight, leaving the Romans to pass the river unmolested, after the enemy had been routed by the appearance of a single beast. 

The combination of armor and a howdah would probably have required a larger, Indian elephant rather than a North African elephant.* Moreover, as [Arvind Ravindran](https://www.quora.com/profile/Arvind-Ravindran-1) pointed out in the comments the Ptolemies' elephant program probably didn't create a breeding stock, so importing from India may have been cost-competitive with using African elephants.

_*Many modern readers think Polyaenus has transposed an incident from Claudius' campaign onto Julius Caesar -- but it's still a story that requires an Indian elephant or a well-domesticated Savannah elephant._
