Originally the Greeks used what’s called an ‘acrophonic’ system, in which the first letter of a spoken number was used as an abbreviation. A single hash mark was a digit, the letter Π for πεντε mean 5, Δ for δέκα meant 10, Η for ἑκατόν was 100, Χ for χίλιοι, 1000 and Μ for μύριοι, 10,000. These were written in a duplicated-additive system similar to Roman numerals, but without the Roman habit of counting down, so __ΔΠΙΙ__  would be 17, __ΗΔΔΙ__  would be 121 and __ΧΧΔΠΙΙΙ__  2019.

However, like Roman numerals, the acrophonic numbers were clumsy and space-consuming. Shorthands evolved for for numbers like 50 or 500, but the system was still cumbersome. So, in the classical period acrophonics were supplemented by a more complex alphabetic system with more symbols, usually known as Ionian numerals because they used symbols unique to the Ionian version of the Greek alphabet.

Ionian numerals were more space efficient, though harder to pick up. The common symbols were:

A tick mark to the left of a digit multiplied it’s value by a thousand, so __͵βιθ__  would be 2019 (2 x 1000 + 10 + 9). A tick mark above and to the right of a digit turned it into fraction, so __T’__  would be 1/300th.

Given Pythagoras’ date (roughly 570–495 BC) it’s hard to be sure which numeric system he would have used; the Ionian system was probably not in use yet but we don’t have any explicit evidence for when it arose so we’re not certain.

However the problems the Pythagoreans discussed in their early days were not especially demanding as far as mathematical notation goes, so it’s entirely possible that they could have been handled entirely with acrophonic notation. On the other hand Ionian-style fractions would have been helpful when dealing with proportions and harmonies, which were key Pythagorean concerns.
