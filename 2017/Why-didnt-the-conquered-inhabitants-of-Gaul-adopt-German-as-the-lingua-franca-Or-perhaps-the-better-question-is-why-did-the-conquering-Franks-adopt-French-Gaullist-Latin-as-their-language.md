# Why didn't the conquered inhabitants of Gaul adopt German as the lingua franca? Or perhaps the better question is why did the conquering Franks adopt French (Gaullist-Latin) as their language?

Two reasons. First off, the barbarian invasions were not a wholesale replacement of the indigenous population. The invaders numbered in the tens, or perhaps hundreds of thousands; the Gallo-Romans in the millions. Although the Franks they definitely impacted the development of Gallic Latin into French, they were a minority of the speakers.

The second aspect is that the Frankish conquerors needed the legal and administrative apparatus of the existing Gallo-Roman society. They replaced the personnel at the top but they depended on the technical sophistication which Latin brought to legal, military and religious matters. Inventing Frankish versions of the relevant vocabulary would take a long time and a lot of literary effort, but there wasn’t a native Frankish literary class as far as we know. The classic example is Charlemagne, who was famous for his support of Latin learning, but himself only semi-literate: like his Frankish predecessors he relied on Latin speakers for the administrative and legal management of his kingdom.

The best analogy would be something like the Mongol conquest of China: it’s far easier for a conquering military caste to adopt the local language of a more complex culture than the reverse.
