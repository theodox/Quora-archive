# If Autodesk Maya cost $100, would the larger number of potential customers provide them with the same amount of money they make now from the product?

It’s kind of unlikely, for a few reasons.

First off, you’d have to increase the user base 15–20x to break even on that kind of price drop . That’s unlikely because Maya is a very complex piece of software that realistically takes at least a couple of years to really master. I don’t think you can expand the market of people who want to do pro-quality 3d by fifteen times that easily, I don’t think there are that many potential users out there. The 3D market has been on a slow growth path for a long time now, most people who need 3D tools have th already — the ones who are just curious are either not numerous or not _that_ curious.

Second, breaking even on revenue isn’t good enough. Maya users are going to be fairly expensive users: they’ll generate a lot of support calls relative to, say, Pokemon Go users. So you can’t just scale up the user base, you need to scale up the profit per user as well or you’re losing ground. You’d need many times more support staff, customer service people, and related specialists to support fifteen times more users (and again: going that large will broaden the range of hardware that’s in use beyond the relatively narrow range of pro-class machines that the current user base has). All of that will eat into the profits of a $100 Maya much more than it does currently.

Last off there is a serious marketing issue: if Maya becomes a hundred dollar product, does that erode its perceived value? Particularly in s market with a decent free alternative like Blender?

So i don't think it's in the cards. What Autodesk desperately wants is steady, predictable revenue: that's why they want to push people into subscriptions. Turning maya into a mas market product is at best the opposite of predictable.
