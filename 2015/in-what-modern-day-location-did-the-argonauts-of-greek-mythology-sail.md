The most common identification is with Colchis, in the eastern end of the Black Sea (modern Georgia):

It's not clear if that represents some actual, historical contact or if it's just Greek shorthand for 'the edge of the world' since Colchis was pretty much the outer limit of the Greek-known world in the pre-classical period when the Argo cycle was conceived; as one Greek writer put it "Kolchian Aia lies at the furthest limits of sea and earth." and it was also known as "the farthest voyage"
