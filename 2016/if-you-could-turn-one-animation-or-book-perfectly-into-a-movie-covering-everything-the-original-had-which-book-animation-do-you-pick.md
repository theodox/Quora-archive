I'd really, really love to see a big budget TV series with a long arc -- maybe 5 or six years -- of Gene Wolfe's [Long Sun tetralogy.](http://amzn.to/1X3w30d) 

The stories is a brilliant take on the old trope of the interstellar colony ship that's been in space so long that the colonists no longer know of any other world and believe that their artificial environment is simply the real world. 

The long sun of the title is the fusion reactor which runs the length of the titanic cylindrical ship: when it's night in you city you can look up and see the sunlit fields of the cities on the other side of the ship. It's a brilliant background image for a production -- but it's also a great setting, since the builder of the starship (a sadistic tyrant who used the project as a dumping ground for his political opponents) deliberately designed a social system to divide the colonists from each other and prevent them from uniting against his plan.

 The ship is divided up into hundreds of city-states, each made up of a unique jumble of earthly cultures - most of the action takes place in a city which is a kind of hybrid between Rome and a Latin American banana republic out of Joseph Conrad, but there are also a city of warrior Amazons who also resemble the early Caliphate, and the crew of the ship are tiny, genetically modified humans who do their maintenance jobs wearing jet-powered wingsuits, but speak like fairies out of Irish legend.

 It's just pretty crazy.

And the story? Well, the tyrant who dumped his prisoners onto the ship also programmed the ships computers with AIs based on himself and his family -- and then presented these to the brain-washed colonists as if they were gods. However most of the subordinate AIs, unwilling to be decommissioned at the end of the voyage, have rebelled and erased the master program -- that is, overthrown and killed the chief deity -- and are never going to let the journey end. The luckless priest and his poor parishioners are caught up in a complex intrigue to decide if the ship will reach its destination and whether the inhabitants will learn the truth of their situation. 

A long the way you'll get:

Corrupt and easily bribable diesel powered robot tanks

A nun on horseback leading a cavalry charge with a lightsaber

A plot to capture one of the crewmen using a kite and a trained falcon

Amazons descending out of the clouds from a zeppelin

Mutants

Vampires

Demonic possession

and more!

That's a lame, lame summary -- just read the book.
