It’s easy to be tempted into eye-rolling when you get asked questions like [Were the Ancient Persians black?](https://www.quora.com/Were-the-Ancient-Persians-black/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=77d1aa36&srid=zLvM) and[ Were the Ancient Greeks and Romans white?](https://www.quora.com/Were-the-Ancient-Greeks-and-Romans-white/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=00965671&srid=zLvM) on a regular basis. Evidently the question about the Holy Roman Empire being a Black Civilization has now disappeared, which is too bad because it had such excellent snark potential.

However, rather than trotting out all the various bizarro-world claims that tend to clog up the arteries of internet ancient histories, it’s better to step back and consider the nature of nationalist claim-mongering of _all_ sorts. Sure, the Afrocentrist varieties that have been very popular for the last couple of years are often very silly — but that’s hardly confined to Afrocentrism.

In fact, the Greeks and Romans themselves did this _all the time._  Every two-bit city or minor noble family in the ancient world could spin a story about how they were descended from the great gods and heroes of legend. The most famous example of all is none other than Julius Caesar himself, whose family claimed to to get its name from Julus, a son of the Trojan refugee prince Aeneas — thus making this most Roman of Romans a Trojan. Of course, in Greek sources the son is named Ascanius, but Romans helpfully pointed out that _Julus_  comes from the Greek _ioulos,_ which means “downy” — it’s supposed to be a nickname for boy just getting his first beard during puberty. Of course, it’s a bit odd for a Trojan refugee in archaic Italy to get his nickname from _Greek…_ but let’s not quibble. It’s a connection that absolutely operates on the same level of plausibility as the Black Socrates school of historiography.

The business of trying to bolster your own prestige by inserting yourself or people like you into other people’s histories is a very old and very common one. Whether it’s a [Welsh monk in the dark ages claiming that King Arthur was a descendant of Roman emperor Constantine](https://www.quora.com/Was-Britain-s-Roman-history-reflected-anywhere-in-Arthurian-legends/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=72b6d6d7&srid=zLvM), or [Malay rajahs claiming descent from Alexander the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikayat_Iskandar_Zulkarnain), people’s appetite for borrowed glory is pretty vast. In a world which produced [British Israelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Israelism) (and its scarier modern offshoots) it’s hard to point the finger at Afrocentrism in particular.

This oddball tendency seems — ironically, if you think about it — to be one of the things we all share.
