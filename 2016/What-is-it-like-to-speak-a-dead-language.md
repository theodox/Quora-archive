Honestly, I wish I knew.

While I try to keep my hand in with Greek and Latin, the experience of reading -- or most of the time "deciphering" -- a language you experience only on paper or on a computer screen is very different from the experience of speaking it. If you read enough you get some sense of the un-written rhythms and nuances of the language. You can glean a little more than a purely grammatical and comparative sense of how things roll -- but it's still pretty thin gruel compared to the meat of a living language. I'm pretty sure the information is hitting very different pathways in my brain. 

Plus the opportunities for reinforcement are few and far between -- the [Unreal Engine 4 Documentation ](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/index.html)is available in English, Chinese, Japanese and Korean... but no Latin...
