[Edward Conway](https://www.quora.com/profile/Edward-Conway) has the gist of it: it took 500 years for the empire to outgrow its origins in military adventurism. The critical weakness of the Roman state -- really as far back as Marius --- was its inability to create a legitimizing force that could keep ambitious generals from seizing the throne. That's the TLDR.

To be fair, the numbers make it look worse than it is because there basically ___was no Roman Empire___ __ in the 3rd century, which provides most of the one-year wonders, assassinations, and coups. Consider this timeline which ends just before Diocletian:

More than half of these names fall into the century after Commodus. Well over a third of them fall in the disastrous 50 years from 235 to 285. Although the chaotic period contains a handful of impressive figures (in particular, the heroic [Aurelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian)) it was, essentially, one interminable civil war.

The emperor lists create an illusion of continuity, disguising how chaotic this period was (the other scholarly name for it this period is the tragically accurate ___[military anarchy](http://www.via-agrippa.com/Military-anarchy)___ ). Moreover emperor lists sometimes show parallel claimants but don't record the separate existence off the short-lived [Gallic Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Empire), the [Palmyrene Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyrene_Empire) of Zenobia, and the many local satrapies which functioned as statelets of their own during this period.

In many ways the situation from the death of Commodus (192) to the accession of Diocletian (284) is reminiscent of China between the [Taiping Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion) and Mao: the central powers were alternately weak, incompetent, and rent by internal strife, but there persisted remarkable degree of cultural continuity at lower levels. Most key social institutions continued to function, albeit in a diminished and slowly deteriorating fashion, but the state was an abstraction more than a living reality: a name and a report of distant battles, but not an expression of social needs. Depending on how you look at it this is a tribute to the strength of Roman (and Chinese) society or a condemnation of the venality of their rulers -- but the scope of the problem is far, far larger than the relatively minor one of individual succession.

It is true that the ideology of hereditary succession and dynastic loyalty -- the sort of 'for King and Country' sentiment we associate with later European monarchs -- can be a very effective tool for staving off this kind of internal strife. By way of illustration, __the list of Kings of England from Alfred to today covers twice the lifespan of the western Roman Empire, but contains only 66 names__ (the [same wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bppubjr/Timeline_Examples#Timeline_of_English_Monarchs) that generated the list above has the English case). It's an interesting example of an idea that seems 'natural' to us, even though we're post-monarchists, but which was in fact anything but inevitable at the time: In Byzantium, hereditary successors were rare enough that the title [Porphyrogennetos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyrogennetos) was a prestigious accolade for the lucky few; and even the [Carolingians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Verdun) casually divided kingdoms among multiple heirs. It took several centuries of primogeniture, compounded with the feudal ideology of vassalage and the aura of divine right to really create the idea that a kingdom was a permanent, inheritable unit to which the subjects owed a 'natural' allegiance.

The closest analogy in Rome was the Republican tradition of [clientela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage_in_ancient_Rome), which did pass down an important reciprocal relationship between a powerful family and its dependents. However this was primarily understood as a kind of traditional _alliance,_ rather than as _allegiance. A_ s Roman culture (and Roman political power) became more diverse and more international the old expectation of long-term loyalties declined. Perhaps more importantly, the decimation of the traditional Italian aristocracy under the principate also weakened this element considerably -- it does not take too many Caligulas or Domitians to undermine the idea of 'fidelity' as a ruling principle.

Western Rome never really embraced hereditary succession -- Augustus had no direct heirs, and instead seems to have felt the old Republican tradition of adoption would provide good candidates (he himself was only a 'Caesar' by adoption). He failed to anticipate the ways in which monarchy changed the traditional rules for competition among siblings and members of the _familia_  -- while the picture of assassinations and intrigue in _I, Claudius_ is sensationalized and comes from hostile sources, being a junior member of the imperial house was not a healthy occupation. There was some degree of heritable aura -- but it was not enough to counterbalance the most important, and deadliest element in Roman politics: __the role of the army.__ 

Ever since the [military reforms of Marius](http://military reforms of Marius) the Roman legions had been tied far more closely to their generals than to the Roman state. The old Republican armies had been staffed primarily by citizen-soldiers, nominally at least independent farmers and townsmen. After Marius the armies were recruited from the landless, the dispossessed, and the urban poor. While they served they were dependent on their generals for chances at loot and glory; when they retired, they could only expect good treatment if their old generals had gone on to positions of power which would give them land and pensions to distribute. The formation of the [First Triumvirate](http://www.livius.org/concept/triumvir/first-triumvirate/), which essentially rang the death knell of the Republic, was driven by Pompey's need to force through a law providing farms for his veterans. The armies became fatally accustomed to seeing powerful generals, rather than the state, as their real patrons -- when Caesar crossed the Rubicon he had almost no defections from the rank and file. The civil wars of Caesar and Augustus only increased the detachment of the military from the state.

Augustus managed to reconcile the contradiction by _becoming_  the state (and by living a long time). Once he was gone, however, the loyalty of the soldiers was increasingly a marketable commodity: you can even see the rate of inflation in what were politely called '[Donativa](http://www.armstrongeconomics.com/research/monetary-history-of-the-world/roman-empire/chronology_-by_-emperor/imperial-rome-julio-claudian-age/caligula-37-41ad/roman-donatives)', otherwise known as 'ransom'. The climax came in the inglorious career of [Didius Julianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didius_Julianus) (193), who __literally bought the empire__  from the Praetorians after they murdered his predecessor, the decent and public-spirited [Pertinax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertinax).

_Pertinax tried to do the right thing. It got him murdered by the army._ 

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-42a1ac00a4755fecc4e589499d8d863a)

_Didius Julianus knew how the game was played. Until Septimius Severus came along._ 

Although Septimius Severus was able to get rid of the Praetorians themselves, he couldn't break the stranglehold of the army on political power. He tried to at least keep them busy enough to stay out of politics -- but his aggressive policies were expensive and started the downward spiral of the civilian economy which climaxed with Diocletian essentially attempting to completely subordinate the civilian realm to the needs of the defense budget. But down to the fall of the west (and for a long time after that in the east) ambitious generals with armies who would follow them against all comers remained a constant threat to the stability of the empire. Indeed, in many ways the barbarian 'invasions' of the 5th century are just a continuation of the same problem, since so many of the invaders were, at one time or another, part of the Roman military ([including Alaric, who took Rome in 410](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=20cb5c83&srid=zLvM)).

I'm not sure if there was an institutional solution to the problem, at least not an easy one.

To some degree the conditions of ancient war in this period favored professional armies over citizen forces. Institutional continuity, regimental tradition, and a powerful non-commissioned officer corp all counted for a lot. Unlike a modern national army of the 19th or 20th century, though, Roman armies were not permanently tethered to an industrial supply chain. They could, if they chose, take what they wanted. This put a lot of power into the hands of the military caste (and, by the end, it really was becoming a caste -- at least if you follow Alexander Demandt or [Walter Goffart](http://amzn.to/1TpscXO)). The _Pax Romana_ itself probably also had something to do with it: by de-militarizing such a huge swath of territory, the empire rendered the vast majority of its citizens more vulnerable to the armies which remained.

The other deep cause was the plutocratization of the Roman Republic -- where, at the end, society was polarized between an urban proletariat dependent on handouts and generalissimos like Pompey and Caesar who literally had dozens of kings trailing them around hoping for an audience. The early empire was much more prosperous -- the end of all those wars and the abolition of trade barriers was a huge boost to the whole Mediterranean world -- but it was no more equal. Moreover it was less "patriotic" because the local ties which predominated in the Republic and Hellenic worlds were dissolving in the common imperial culture. This disinclined ordinary people to think they could stand up to the soldiers and assert their rights. Even the wealthy and powerful were cowed: the Senate's theoretical role as the repository of sovereignty never led to anything practical, except perhaps for the fortunate choice of [Nerva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerva).

Lastly, there was also no broad ideological basis that could hold emperors accountable (at least, not until well into the Byzantine period). Many emperors tried to use religion as a unifying force, but the diffuse and diverse traditions of paganism didn't provide enough focus to move the masses (this was particularly tough given the wide range of peoples and languages in the empire: as subsequent events show 'divine' can mean very different things in Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria and Jerusalem). The philosophical schools were very diverse and disagreed among themselves. The Stoics -- like Marcus Aurelius -- were often public spirited but equally often they were quietists who preached detachment and calm instead of strenuous virtue.

So, it's not clear to me anyway that the some change in the laws could have reversed all of these forces and given the Roman succession the pleasant monotony of the English or French version. The long term decline of the Roman economy seems to have damped down the swings eventually (though of course this had terrible consequences of its own). In Byzantium, the Christianization of society (and eventually, relentless attacks from the Arab and Muslim frontiers) created something of the sense of 'national mission' and public obligation which the middle Empire had lost. But it's hard -- very hard -- to keep a powerful military in its barracks down the centuries; we can see that even in today's world where military states-within-states are extremely persistent and hard to subordinate to orderly civilian power.
