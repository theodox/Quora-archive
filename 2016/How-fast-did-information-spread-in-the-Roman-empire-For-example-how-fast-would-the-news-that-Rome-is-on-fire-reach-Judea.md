Some kinds of information traveled very fast:

That's a Lord of the Rings style bonfire, ready to go, at a _castra limitaneorum_  on the Danube. The Roman frontier was not fortified (see [Why didn't the Romans build a great wall of Rome?)](https://www.quora.com/Why-didnt-the-Romans-build-a-great-wall-of-Rome) but it was studded with fortlets and [observation towers](http://cosmicdiary.org/fpatat/2009/12/23/where-is-the-roman-watch-tower/) designed to provide timely warnings to the mobile field armies that the Romans preferred to fixed fortifications. They used a combination of beacons, smoke-signals, and something like a semaphore - but as far as we know they never developed anything like Morse Code. So for some kinds of time-critical information the communications were nearly instantaneous - but very low bandwidth. 

For slower but more information-rich communications there were two tools. 

The sea was the real nerve-system of the empire. Sea travel was significantly faster than travel by road. To pick an example more or less at random, a trip from Rome to Arelate -- modern Arles, France -- would take a month overland, but only 8 days by ship for the same distance (the numbers come from the invaluable [ http://orbis.stanford.edu/](http://orbis.stanford.edu/) -- they're modern estimates but based on a lot of sources, supplemented with computer models). 

Sea Travel times, like those of 18th century Europe, varied considerably by season and also by urgency: the difference between a military dispatch ship with well-conditioned rowers and a sails-only merchantman would be pretty noticeable too. To give a general idea, however, here's a few best-case sailing times, again via ORBIS:

Rome to Carthage: __5 days__ 

Rome to Tingis (the southern 'Pillar of Hercules'): __15 days__ 

Rome to Constantinople: __21 days__ 

Rome to Alexandria: __14 days__ 

For a more leisurely, commercial voyage (staying in sight of land and avoiding night sailing) the times would be longer, possibly as much as double.

On land, the famous Roman road network was primarily designed to speed the movement of couriers and armies (trade was a secondary consideration). But even a good road is only really usable by day; horses and riders tire out. River communications were preferred where possible for the same reason sea travel was preferred. One of the reasons Rome became politically less and less important in the later Empire was the impossibility of managing wars across the Rhine or the Danube with several weeks of inescapable communications lag: forward headquarters like Trier, Milan, and Sirmium became the real 'capitals' of the empire since the emperors had to spend so much time there rather than in Rome. Constantinople was a brilliant pick as a new capital because it had both good sea and land communications with several critical fronts. Here's some best-case ORBIS numbers for both ordinary foot traffic and for military couriers with priority use of horse relays. The worst case numbers where weather intervened could be much worse, particularly in the Alps or the Balkans, and of course mixed land-sea routes could be dicey.

Rome to Trier (Augusta Treverorum, military HQ on the lower Rhine): __33 days. 7 days courier__ 

Rome to Sirmium (Military HQ on the Danube): __21 days including crossing the Adriatic, 5 days courier__ 

Rome to Augsburg (Augusta Vindelicum, military HQ on the upper Rhine): __22 days foot, 6 days courier__ 

As you can see these numbers are pretty sluggish by modern standards but would not have been terribly surprising to any European government before the 19th century (sea communications were faster by the 17th century or so, but not overwhelmingly so in the mediterranean). 

For the specific case of news reaching Judea the trip is almost entirely by sea. The Great Fire happened in July, so it was the peak of the summer sailing season. At that time of year the first news would have taken about 13 days, arriving on the 2d or 3d of August of the year 64 (but the fire lasted a week) -- always assuming good weather, of course..
