Not hard evidence, no. It is worth pointing out that only a really unusual find could actually change the current skeptical consensus. Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, which was a large and prosperous city that was almost two millennia old when it was destroyed. If there really was an Aeneas, he arrived as a refugee after years of misadventures across the Mediterranean. In Virgil’s telling, his fleet was about fifteen ships — perhaps two thousand Trojans. What kind of traces would they leave? What would we expect to find?

According to legend, the actual Trojan settlement would have been at [Lavinium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavinium), or [Alba Longa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba_Longa) not Rome — mythology says Aeneas founded the Roman people, not the city of Rome which came 14 generations later.* Alba has never been clearly identified: the Romans destroyed it around 600 BC so we can only give a general account of where it was. However Lavinium is well known: it’s the home of the most famous “Trojan” ruin in Italy, the so-called [Heroon of Aeneas](http://www.ansa.it/english/news/lifestyle/arts/2017/01/05/mythical-heroon-of-aeneas-site-to-open_3e6b5c30-27c3-4aa0-8d9d-d5861796e483.html).

The heroon was identified as hero’s burial ground at least as far back as the first century, and possibly four centuries before that. Unfortunately, the existing heroon actually dates from the seventh century BC, so about 500 years too late for the actual Aeneas.
