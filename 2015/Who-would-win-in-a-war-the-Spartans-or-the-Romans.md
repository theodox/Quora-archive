The Romans did win, quite handily, although they did have Greek allies as well: [War against Nabis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_against_Nabis)

This was late Sparta, after the ancient discipline had fallen on hard times and the Spartans were much less distinctively unique than their ancient forebearers. But as [Nick Huang](https://www.quora.com/profile/Nick-Huang-9) points out, the Romans were much more flexible and innovative tacticians and were also vastly better at logisitics. More importantly they were much better diplomats: they were far better at attracting and keeping friends. The Spartans had a habit of alienating even their closest allies.
