# I have to take a photo for a Latin competition in Chicago. It should be classical or classically inspired. What should I do?

Besides the Art Institute's collection, which has plenty of actual Greek and Roman stuff, there is a lot of Latinate architectural detail in Chicago. My personal favorite is the [Shedd Aquarium](http://www.sheddaquarium.org/About-Us/History--Architecture/), which was somewhat jokingly designed as a 'temple of Neptune' and should have lots of interesting photo opportunities.
