They are an Italic people from the central Appenines. Their chief city was near the extinct [Fucine Lake](http://www.ancientromelive.org/fucine-lake) in modern Abruzzo, Italy.

They are not “proto-Roman”; their language was from the Osco-Umbrian language family rather than the Latino -Faliscan family which produced Latin. From about 300 BC they were Roman allies, and they were regarded as one of the most reliable and skillful of the allied armies. They retained their independence as allies down until the [Social War ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_War_(91–88_BC))of 91–88 BC, after which they became Roman citizens and gradually submerged into the common mass of Roman Italy.

_A Marsian coin of the social war period_ 

Mythologically, the Marsi claimed descent from Marsyas, a satyr who challenged Apollo to a music contest and lost. While this is probably just an example of lazy etymology, it does also tie the Marsi to Asia Minor (Marsyas was from Phrygia) — another example of a central Italian people with a mythological origin in that region.
