We don't usually have the kind of information you want, at least not at that level of granularity. Even getting firm Julian (modern) dates for well documented events is tough: the Greek calendrical system was very messy, and every city had it's own version. Dating of documents or events was rarely done with the kind of precision we expect, and are often lucky to get events dated with in a (messy, ambiguous) Greek lunar month. Sometimes we get lucky -- for example, we know that Nicias abandoned the evacuation of Syracuse on 28 August 413 BC, because it was due to a [ lunar eclipse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_significant_lunar_eclipses) we can date by other means. However many important dates -- for example the death of Socrates -- are dated only to the year or season even though well documented.

The main exceptions to this rule will be legal documents. particularly decrees of the assembly or treaties. These are sometimes dated with more precision (for example, by including the name of the presiding archon or the council secretary who recorded the text. When we can match those up to other records we can get more accurate dating. Unfortunately neither the archon lists nor the legal texts survive intact in large numbers, so again you'll have a hard time finding accuracy much better than +/- a year.

Eli Bickermans [Chronology of the Ancient World](http://www.amazon.com/Chronology-Ancient-World-E-Bickerman/dp/0500400059) has a lot of detailed information on the problems of dating, as well as tons of tables that scholars use to find dates from obscure references. It does have a synoptic (lots of places at once) chronology, not quite year-by-year, as well. There's a good, less detailed one in the Oxford Ancient History, and I think the Cambridge Ancient History series include chronology tables as well.
