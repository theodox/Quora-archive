# If the Trojan War was around 1200 BC and at that time, the peoples of the sea came to Phoenicia, could it be that the people of the Sea are Trojans?

The ethnic origins of the Sea People are endlessly debated without much closure. The sources which actually try to pin names on them are all Egyptian ([this page has a good rundown of the named groups as the Egyptians saw them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples#Primary_documentary_records)) and unfortunately few of them are beyond debate.

Of [groups listed in the Egyptian sources](https://www.quora.com/Where-did-the-Sea-Peoples-the-people-who-invaded-Greece-Egypt-and-the-Hittite-Empire-in-the-Late-Bronze-Age-come-from/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=4354e5a4&srid=zLvM) there’s a good degree of confidence that the Meshwesh are Libyans from Cyrenaica (they show up in other, non-Sea-People contexts) and the Sherden are probably Sardinians. After that, we’re mostly trying to match up names with contemporary ethnic groups based on sound similarities. Maybe the Denyen are Greeks — Homer’s _Danaioi._ Maybe the _Lukka_ are what the Greeks knew as Lycians. Perhaps the _Shekelesh_ are Sikels from Sicily (this is well before the Greeks showed up their). But these identifications are pretty shaky.

It has been suggested that the _Teresh_  are [Tyrrhenians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrhenians)(sometimes written Tyrsenians). This group has ties to northwest Asia Minor and is sometimes invoked in connection with the legendary escape of Trojan refugees to Italy. If the association of Bronze Age Tyrhenians with Troy is right _and_ the Teresh really are Trojans, then yes: there could be a connection between Troy and the Sea Peoples.

However a more common hypothesis is that the Sea Peoples included contingents we’d recognize as Greek — the _Denyens/Danaoi_ and perhaps the _Ekwesh_  as _Achaioi_ . In that retelling the destruction of Troy is just one of the many episodes in the calamitous end of the Bronze Age in the eastern Mediterranean; Agamemnon and Achilles are just a couple of freebooters pulling the Bronze Age world down around their own ears.

Unfortunately we’ll have a hard time resolving this question. We’re dependent on a very small number of sources, and the Egyptians were not always the best ethnologists: in the heyday of Mycenae the whole Greek world was, to the Egyptians, just “Crete and the islands.”

Barring a radical new archaeological find we’ll probably be debating this for a long time to come.
