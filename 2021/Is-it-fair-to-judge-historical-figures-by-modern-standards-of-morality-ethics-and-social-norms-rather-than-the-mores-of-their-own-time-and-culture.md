I don’t know if it’s _fair_ to judge historical actors by your own, oh-so-modern standards.

I’m pretty sure, however, that you’re going to do it regardless of what comes out of this thread.

Very few us are capable of suspending our own moral reflexes: I literally don’t have the ability look at Kim Jong Un or Boko Haram and “judge them by the standards of their culture.” More than that, I don’t really want to acquire it. It doesn’t take a lot of deep moral reflection to conclude that kidnapping schoolgirls or building forced labor camps are bad. Condemning them doesn’t score me any points as a Good Person, and — unfortunately — it doesn’t have much of a practical outcome either.

However I’d really prefer to think that somebody in the CIA is busy trying to understand what makes these people tick, looking for patterns in their behavior, and trying to understand their likely impacts. As bad as things are, retweeting sarcastic memes, is not going to make them better. _Opinions_ are for civilians; _data_ is for professionals. _Insight_  is the marriage of both. It’s a lot harder to achieve any insight if you’re trying to jump straight to the scoring phase of the game.

The intellectual discipline of history requires deferring moral judgements long enough to sort and sift and contextualize the data: expending some of your precious, limited, fleeting time on earth taking time to gather information and understand the people you’re passing sentence on. For the professionals that involves a lot of work, often very boring and technical work. The rest of us generally have to rely on what the professionals provide, but if we’re lucky a little of that critical distance rubs off and allows us to put our instinctive reactions on the back burner while we form a mental picture of the things we learn. I’ve never met anybody who really completely removed their own judgements from the study of the past; such people might exist but I’m sure they’re pretty bad party guests. Good historians however do learn how to park their instincts when the work requires it, just as doctors learn how to compartmentalize crises in the hospital: but, like doctors, historians are humans too and the human component of their work should not be trivialized.

You’ll note that I haven’t referenced “standards of the time” at all so far.

As many other answers point out, “standards of the time” are something of a chimera: few times are so poor and so homogenous that they don’t produce a multitude of standards. Historical circumstance does, however, produce _contexts_ which absolutely ought to qualify your judgments. From a purely intellectual standpoint, if you want to accomplish anything besides sticking your thumb in the eye of a group you disagree with, context matters.

A context is not the same thing as a _standard_ . Standards reflect values which, as we all know, are rarely universal. Contexts reflect probabilities and practicalities which you can reason about in a quasi-empirical way. Whether you believe in the right of the government to tax your income or not is, for purposes of this argument, a _standard of your times._ The IRS and it’s power to send you to jail or non-payment is _context._ 

Context does not negate the reality of choices, but it does help to differentiate between superficially similar ones. That’s true on the intellectual level and it’s true on the moral level. A hedge fund manager who rips off his clients, a mother who steals bread to feed her hungry children, and a bored teenager who shoplifts for thrills are all stealing. Anybody who can’t see that context ought to qualify they way they are treated is not likely to have a successful career as a moral philosopher.

To take a more historical example:

Nowadays, the only people who react to verbal insults or social slights with deadly force are psychopaths and gangsters. 250 years ago it was much more socially acceptable — indeed, in many social circles failure to assert your right to violence could have serious practical consequences. If you get to the end of _Hamilton_ and don’t have some kind of opinion on the morality of the final duel, you’re not human; if your conclusion does not account for how alien the context of that duel was from our modern way of doing things, you’re jumping straight to the easy part and missing the point.

From the point of view of “standards,” the _code duello_  is a giant mess: duels were both widespread and widely condemned, illegal and socially approved, denounced in pulpits and reinforced by powerful conventions. As the context for individual decisions, however, it was a fact that was hard to ignore. Many a man (and a few women!) found themselves choosing pistols at dawn not because of their own righteous indignation, not because of bloodlust, not because of misplaced machismo.: rather because they risked losing their social position if they declined a challenge. In some social circles a 1-in-14 chance of killing or being killed was a less risky proposition than facing the consequences of being labelled a coward.

Does all that mean that Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton were just “products of their times?”

Again, no. It only means that Burr’s duel with Hamilton included incentives and options quite alien to our own way of thinking. The calculus which led each of them to Weehawken is simply not one that any of us — unless, perhaps, one you belongs to a drug cartel or an Afghan clan — understand by instinct. Only an active investment of imagination can place you even approximately in either man’s shoes.

Making that investment does not somehow make it less ridiculous that two intelligent, accomplished people decided to shoot each other to settle a dispute about a quotation in a third party’s letters. Standards be damned: you can’t convince me that’s a good outcome. Nevertheless, the routes which led those two men to that absurd situation are not routes that most of us are familiar with. Trying to understand them is an exercise in _empathy_ — which is the foundation of morality.

If the process of learning about the past teaches you to appreciate the many different ways we’ve have invented to be human, it’s a good exercise regardless of what pronouncements you make. If it forces you to reflect on the way your own actions are placed in a historical context not of your own choice, that’s a bonus. If all it does is provide you an opportunity to trumpet your own values for an audience that can’t hear you, it’s pretty pointless. The dead don’t care what you think of them.
