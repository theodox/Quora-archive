I have a soft spot for history’s losers. Here’s some striking (note I do not say “strikingly handsome” planes from the ranks of the also-rans:

The [Boulton Paul Defiant, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulton_Paul_Defiant)an unhappy effort to recreate the glory days of the [Bristol F.2 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_F.2_Fighter)in the Great War. Ugly, slow, and hard to maneuver the Defiants suffered terribly in the the Battle of France. Some survived to be find a niche as night fighters, where that heavy turret gun proved somewhat useful.

The [Macchi C.200 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macchi_C.200)was actually not a bad plane, though a bit underpowered. Her vices were primarily aesthetic:

I have a genuine soft spot for the [Polikarpov I-16, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polikarpov_I-16)which is just shy of being a militarized GeeBee racer. Plus, it was winterized for takeoffs and landings on skis!

For a pair of gawky disasters, there’s the [Fairey Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairey_Battle)

..and it’s equally awkard cousin, the [Fulmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairey_Fulmar)

Both managed to completely avoid the sweet-spot between “fighter” and “bomber”, excelling at neither role. They were, however, reliable. That’s something.

The Fleet Air Arm definitely had one too many beers, because in addition to the Fulmar they also commissioned the spectacularly garish [Blackburn Skua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_Skua) and it’s even uglier twin, the [Blackburn Roc. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_Roc)The Skua, at least, was reliable if unglamorous; the Roc was intended to replace the Skua but was roundly rejected in favor of its dumpy predecessor.

OK, now that I got that off my chest here’s one pretty one on which I have a genuine crush: the [Bristol Beaufighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Beaufighter)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fceacb82a83eb78e3e557b1b51cda7a6-c)

It occupied almost the same niche as the better known DeHavilland Mosquito. Nobody can deny the Mostquito’s classic good looks or enviable record, but the Beaufighter’s quirky late-art-deco aesthetic and its ferocious reputation as an anti-shipping strike platform are very unique.
