Homer of course has them speaking Greek, worshipping Greek gods, and generally behaving in ways that would let them pass for Greek. But of course our version of Homer is at least four centuries removed from the traditional date for the Trojan War — assuming, for the purposes of the question, that there really is a historic kernel of truth to the Homeric stories.* The Greek-ish ambience of Homer’s Troy makes some people argue that Troy was, in fact, what we would call a “__Greek__ ” city: Homer after all does not seem to care about the later Greeks distinction between “Hellenes” and “barbarians”**

If we follow the archaeological evidence, however, there’s a strong candidate with at least some concrete support from the field. __[Luwian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luwian_language)__ ____ is an Indo-European language that was important in Bronze Age Anatolia. The written language is found as far away as Syria. The only textual find from Bronze Age Troy is a seal inscribed with Luwian hieroglyphs.

We’re sure that Luwian was a widespread language in the Hittite empire which was the dominant regional power in eastern and southern Anatolia. However the situation in the Troad, which in the northwest corner of Asia Minor, is much murkier:

_The purple areas show the distribution of Luwian inscriptions. As you can seen the nearest finds are more then 100 miles from Troy_ 

About half of the named Trojans in the poems bear names which are not Greek in origins; scholars have tried to fit these into Luwian etymologies with some success, for example _Priam_  could be Luwian _Pariya-muwa, “_ exceptionally brave.” On the other the fact that so many Trojans have obvious Greek names could be read as an indication that Troy had some kind of hybrid culture with a mix of Anatolian and Greek influences.

__Edit:__ There’s a third candidate which I had I originally omitted for simplicity’s sake but it’s worth mentioning. Just as Homer inspired the archaeologists who ultimately found Troy, the Roman legends around Aeneas have been linked to a hypothetical Bronze-age migration from Asia Minor. There’s some linguistic evidence which links Etruscan with the language spoken in historic times on the island of [Lemnos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemnos), which was quite close to Troy. The “__[Tyrsenian languages”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrsenian_languages)__  would link Italy with the North Aegean, and there is some evidence of west Anatolian DNA in central Italy both in people and cattle. [The evidence for some kind of link is pretty good, though that’s a different matter than “Virgil is true!”.](https://www.quora.com/If-the-Romans-were-the-Trojans-in-the-past-why-did-they-stop-worshiping-the-Greek-gods-and-stop-speaking-Greek)

Luwian, thus, is our best guess for the language of Troy — but it remains a guess. Greek — or perhaps more accurately a kind of colonial Greek, since the poems depict the Trojan side as a multi-ethnic coalition and including people with a mix of Greek and foreign personal names — is a conceivable alternative, though it would be ironic if the story that came to symbolize the conflict between “East” and “West” was actually fought by Greeks on both sides. There’s also that tantalizing Etruscan connection. Unfortunately for us written Etruscan is clearly recorded in variants of Greek characters, so it must be four or five centuries post-Troy at a minimum. Thus, if there were a “Trojan” script it would not look like Etruscan in written form. To date, however, our only archaeological confirmation is that single Luwian seal — which gives Luwian a slender lead in the race.

As with most questions about the historicity of the Iliad, it’s interesting to ponder — and impossible to resolve with much certainty.



*I think some degree of historicity is likely, for reasons laid out in this answer: [Why do archeologists think that the Trojan War happened?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-archeologists-think-that-the-Trojan-War-happened/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=09c73ec6&srid=zLvM) However it’s always best to be tentative with this kind of literary evidence.

**In one place he does call Carian allies of Troy “barbarophones” — but Thucydides says flat out that Homer never uses the word “barbarian.” This leads many experts to believe that Carian passage is a later interpolation, not Homer’s original wording.
