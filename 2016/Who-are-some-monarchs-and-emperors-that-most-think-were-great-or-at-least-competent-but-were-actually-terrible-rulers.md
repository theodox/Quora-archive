My vote for most overrated "great" goes to [Theodosius I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I) "the Great", the last man to rule a united Roman Empire.

 _A perfect metaphor for Theodosius (center) and his "accomplishments"_ 

 His primary achievement as a ruler was a talent for winning civil wars against other Romans; against barbarian invaders like the Goths he fared much less well. He also massacred the at least 7000 civilians in Thessaloniki, earning him the unusual achievement of being the first Roman emperor to be excommunicated. He was nevertheless an enthusiastic religious persecutor of pagans, Manichees, and a variety of kinds of Christians. 

As his final gift to history. Theodosius divided the empire anew between his two useless sons: [Honorius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorius_(emperor)). a petulant ten year old at the time of his accession who lived to preside over the sack of Rome (by Goths who had formerly been in Theodosius' employ) and [Arcadius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadius) whose career as eastern Emperor is mostly the record of which favorite or minister was best able to manipulate him.
