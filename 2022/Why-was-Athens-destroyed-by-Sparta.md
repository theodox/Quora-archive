The real questions is, __why__ ___wasn’t___ __Athens destroyed by Sparta?__ 

The Peloponnesian War (430–404 BC) was to ancient Greece roughly what the Napoleonic wars were to Europe: a generation-long conflict which sucked in almost every major power on the political level and which split Greek society along ideological lines. This struggle spawned civil wars and political upheaval even when the main military clashes were elsewhere.

Traditional wars between Greek city-states were limited in scope and intensity. They rarely lasting more than a year or two, and the complete capitulation of a city to an enemy army was fairly rare. The Peloponnesian conflict, though, was unusually vicious: since it included both an inter-state struggle and a social struggle within many cities it combined the worst aspects of conventional and civil wars. Many of the conventional restraints on wartime behavior eroded, and the complete annihilation of civilian populations — until this point, exceptionally rare — became a tool of policy. The Athenians, for example, annihilated the neutral city of [Melos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Melos) without even bothering to provide a pretext; the Thebans and Spartans wiped out [Plataea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Plataea) because it had resisted too stubbornly against long odds.

So when the Spartans and their allies finally brought Athens to heel in 404, there were definitely factions within the victorious alliance which wanted the city destroyed once and for all.

> in very truth a proposition to sell the Athenians into slavery was actually made in the assembly of the allies, and that at this time Erianthus the Theban also made a motion that the city be razed to the ground, and the country about it left for sheep to graze. Afterwards, however, when the leaders were gathered at a banquet, and a certain Phocian sang the first chorus in the "Electra" of Euripides, which begins with

> "O thou daughter of Agamemnon,
 I am come, Electra, to thy rustic court,"

> all were moved to compassion, and felt it to be a cruel deed to abolish and destroy a city which was so famous, and produced such poets

_Plutarch,_ _[Lysander, 15](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Lysander*.html)_ 

It’s no accident that it was the Thebans and Corinthians who advocated most strongly for the destruction of Athens — Thebes was a next-door neighbor with centuries of accumulated grudges about border conflicts and local dominance, while Corinth was Athens’ main commercial rival.

It was ultimately the Spartans who decided to preserve Athens — but not merely due to their appreciation for Athenian poetry.

It was obvious that Sparta would be the unchallenged leader of Greece in the aftermath of the war. But “unchallenged leader” a title that rarely lasted long in the notoriously volatile world of Greek city-state relations. They Spartans anticipated that as soon as Athens was no longer a threat the two remaining major powers (who just so happened to be Thebes and Corinth) would looking to topple the Spartan hegemony. A surviving Athens, with an existential debt to Sparta and a poisonous hatred of both Thebes and Corinth, would be a valuable asset in the post-war world.

As it happens, the Spartans miscalculated. The oligarchic government they imposed on Athens was so hated that it was ousted in less than a year, and Athenian gratitude didn’t last much longer. Within a decade the Spartans made the mistake of intervening in Asia Minor during a Persian civil war. Once the Persians regained their footing they pushed the Spartans out and paid handsome subsidies to any Greeks who would work with them. Athens — alongside erstwhile enemies Thebes and Corinth — [fought the Spartans for nearly eight years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_War) That conflict that finally ended with all sides exhausted; the Persians dictated terms to all of the Greeks, with Sparta acting as essentially a Persian police force in the Greek world.
