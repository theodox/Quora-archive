No.

Athenian citizenship was not, in Solon’s day, [as restrictive as it would be a century and a half later under Pericles](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0009%3Achapter%3D9%3Asection%3D3%3Asubsection%3D1#:~:text=In%20451%20B.C.%20Pericles%20introduced,and%20father%20both%20were%20Athenians.) — but it was still very much rooted in the usual Greek approach to citizenship, which was generally [jus sanguinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis) (inheritance based) rather than [jus soli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli) (territorial based). That said, Solon’s laws — in contrast to those of Pericles — did allow for naturalization under some circumstances:

> He permitted only those to be made citizens who were permanently exiled from their own country, or who removed to Athens with their entire families to ply a trade. This he did, as we are told, not so much to drive away other foreigners, as to invite these particular ones to Athens with the full assurance of becoming citizens; he also thought that reliance could be placed both on those who had been forced to abandon their own country, and on those who had left it with a fixed purpose.

[Plutarch, Solon 24](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/solon*.html)

Unfortunately we don’t know what other requirements might have been involved. The existence in the next century of a large community of non-citizen [metoikoi ](http://www.fhw.gr/chronos/05/en/society/metoikoi_intro.html)(“resident aliens”) suggests that it may have been difficult or expensive to get fully naturalized.

Citizenship was not entirely a binary affair, in any case. Solon’s constitution created four recognized social classes: The wealthy _pentakosiomedimnoi_ were aristocrats whose lands produced 500 or more measures of grain*, the landowning upper class. The _hippeis_ , or “horsemen” were also wealthy, with an annual income of 300 measures. Tradesmen and merchants dominated the third class, the _zeugitai_ (“teamsters”) , equivalent to 200 measures. Below that were the laborers, the _thetes_ . All four classes were “free”, but only the first two classes could hold office and the political participation of the _thetes_ was limited to voting in the assembly. It’s worth mentioning that these classes were based on wealth, rather than heredity: if a laborer made enough money to rise in the ranks, he was legally entitled to participate at a higher political level even if he still faced snobbery from the traditional elites.

Solon’s reforms [ended the practice of debt-slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seisachtheia), which had become endemic in his day. He [freed Athenians who who were in bondage at home and abroad](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plut.%20Sol.%2015.5&lang=original). He made it illegal for parents to sell their citizen children into slavery** He did not, however, outlaw slavery as such: if you were a non-Athenian bought or captured by Athenians, a slave you remained. One of his laws forbade slaves to practice at the gymnasion, where membership was a jealously guarded aristocratic privilege.

Lastly it’s important to remember that citizenship for women didn’t confer political rights regardless of social class. It did provide some legal protections (though Athenian women in general had very limited rights). It’s not clear if a citizen mother who was legally married to a non-citizen father resident in Athens conferred citizenship on her children in Solon’s day.

* A _medimnos_  is roughly 52 liters, or 1.47 bushels. You could be an aristocrat in Athens if your land was as productive as a modern American farm of 15 acres (6 hectares). In antiquity, with much lower yields, this was probably closer to 125 acres (50.5 hectares).
** There’s a sometimes-quoted exception may have allowed girls caught having premarital sex to be sold as slaves.
