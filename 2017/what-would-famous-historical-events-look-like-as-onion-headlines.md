__Local man executed for being a dick__ 

Yesterday around the hour of Mesembria, Socrates son of Sophroniscus was executed on charges of impiety and corrupting the youth of the city. Sources close to the proceeding, however, claim that the real reason for the verdict was that the convicted man was kind of an asshole.

_Many blame Socrates’ conviction on his refusal to shut the hell up, even on his deathbed_ 

Socrates earned a reputation as a philosopher — and a pain in the ass — with his habit of subjecting random passersby to intense questioning, often forcing total strangers to waste an hour in defining perfectly ordinary Greek words like “truth” or “justice.” Many Athenians have recounted stories of the Alopeke man’s irritating behavior, particularly his habit of hijacking conversations. “I remember once I was just home having a little sacrifice,” said Cephalus the Syracusan of the acccused, “and Socrates shows up. I’m trying to make conversation, you know, but he got onto this weird business about how telling the truth and paying your debts didn’t mean you were a good person. All of a sudden it’s like I’ve got a bunch of garlic-breathing Scythians putting me on the rack! ‘Don’t you think so-and-so, Cephalus?’ ‘Wouldn’t you agree, Cephalus’ — and damned if he’ll let me get a word in past ‘I suppose so’. Guy had no interior monologue *at all*, if you know what I mean”.

Many also found Socrates’ eccentric ideas hard to take. “So, Socrates asked me to make him a chair,” said Rhaskos the woodworker, “but he insists that it’s got to be a *pure* chair — like, no wood, no glue, no nails! I’m like ‘what do you mean, buddy?’ and he starts talking about this cave, and people chained up in the cave, and like shadow puppets or some shit… dude was cuckoo.” The philosopher Timeaus of Locri claimed that Socrates had misquoted him in embarrassing ways, suggesting for example that God is a giant sphere or that the soul is attached to the body with extremely small nails — two views which the Timaeus hotly denied and described as “goofy.”

The final straw for members of the jury came during Socrates’ conclusion of his own defense at the trial. The self-described philosopher, rather than denying the charges against him, claimed that his obnoxious behavior was in fact a public service and demanded that, rather than executing him, the city should provide him free lunch vouchers. “I was hoping the joker got the message and just go off into exile,” said one Aphidna man, “but after that crack about the lunches? Who’s he think he is, Aristides the [expletive deleted] Just?”

Twitter user @Strepsiades summed it up the widely held attitude in a heavily retweeted message yesterday “Socrates? Even more of a wanker than me!” As of this morning the #HeadInTheClouds hashtag had attracted dozens of similar tweets, including “Corrupting the youth and just annoying everyone else” and “Just in: Philosopher too dumb to apologize in own apology.” A pro-Socratean hashtag #BeautifulAndGood attracted a mere handful of retweets in the same period. Meletus of Pitheus, one of the prosecuting attorneys at Socrates’ trial, claims that even those are “sandal-puppets” — fake accounts created by Alt-Aristocratic groups and Tyrant Supporters. In a statement today Meletus also asserted that the execution of Socrates is exactly what the city needs at this time, stating that “Democracy can’t survive if people go around saying whatever they feel like, whenever they feel like it.”

Socrates is survived by his wife Xanthippe, widely regarded as kind of a bitch. According to Crito of Alopece , Socrates died owing a cock to Aesclepios, which several persons described as “typical of that jerk.”

A memorial service will be held in the groves of Academe tomorrow.
