All ancient chronology includes a degree of uncertainty that is a bit surprising.

Ancient calendars were not always well anchored to the solar year — many ( like modern Islamic, Hebrew, and Chinese calendars) were lunar rather than solar. There were many competing calendars and reconciling them was difficult and error prone. Almost no one used serial year numbers; it was much more common for local calendars to record the passage of the years using the names of local officials — a system which was vulnerable to interruptions driven by wars or political changes.

All of this adds up to a challenge for historians and chronologists. Rome definitely shares many of these challenges, particularly before the 2d century BC. However by the standards of ancient chronology Roman dating after that time is quite good and well supported by a variety of external evidence.

__Early Rome__ 

The oldest Roman calendar suffered from all of these problems. Roman tradition itself recorded several adjustments to the calendar intended to keep it aligned to the solar year. The traditional reckoning system was based on the annual rotation of the consuls, but the consular system itself took some time to settle down — in the early republic the years had originally been reckoned by a different set of officials, the praetors, and during most of the fifth century BC there were no consuls at all due to political conflicts in the city.

The Romans did have lists of magistrates going back to the foundation of the Republic in 509 BC, which in theory _should_  establish the chronology pretty well. However, we generally regard the records before the first Punic War (264 BC) as rather shaky — even more so before the sack of Rome by the Gauls (traditionally, 387 BC). Archaeology and other evidence for this period helps us confirm a very broad outline of the traditional chronology, but the we don’t put much faith in precise dates in the first two or three centuries of the republic. [The era of the kings offers next to nothing we can use for precise chronology](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-archaeological-evidence-for-the-Roman-Kingdom/answer/Steve-Theodore)— we continue to repeat the traditional date of 753 BC for convenience as the founding date of Rome mostly for lack of anything better. That date was calculated by the Roman antiquarian [Varro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Terentius_Varro) in the early years of the empire and was the most popular of several competing theories.

__Late Republic__ 

After the Punic wars, our information becomes more copious and more precise. The [annual consular lists ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasti_Capitolini)from this era are better preserved and more reliable, and as Rome became more and more involved in the affairs of the Greek world, we can begin to cross-check against Greek, Greco-Egyptian, Jewish, and eventually Parthian records. So, for example, we can be pretty sure that [Judah Maccabee made his deal with the Roman Republic in 161 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman%E2%80%93Jewish_Treaty), because the Book of Maccabees reports it for the 151st year of the Seleucid calendar, which began in our 312 BC and was backed by solid Babylonian astronomy. T. Flaminus [proclaimed the “freedom of the Greeks” at the Greek Isthmian games of 196 BC,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmian_Games) a date we can see as part of the long running series of biennial athletic contests that had been running for four hundred years at that point.

On top of that, Julius Caesar undertook a reform of the Roman calendar starting in 44 BC. It took another generation to settle in but once it was up and running it provided a solid framework which lasted until the Renaissance; over sixteen centuries the calendar drifted by only ten days relative to the seasons.

__Imperial era__ 

The developments in the late Republic, by themselves, would put Roman chronology in top league worldwide; most historic calendars (especially from 2,000 years ago) are less well grounded.

We also have excellent ways of verifying the some of the key points of Roman chronology in the imperial era thanks to the work of Claudius Ptolemy, a Greco-Egyptian astronomer who lived in the second century. His [Canon of Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_of_Kings) tied the solar year to the reigns of a series of monarchs beginning with Nabonassar, king of Babylon, in 747 BC. The royal reigns were marked relative to celestial events such as lunar and solar eclipses (Ptolemy chose Nabonassar as a start because he was inaugurated just after a lunar eclipse), allowing us to have reliable checkpoints once or twice in every successive generation. His list extends all the way down to the reign of Roman emperor [Antoninus Pius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoninus_Pius), giving us a very solid footing for the first two hundred years of the empire.

__Later Empire__ 

The Romans didn’t adopt serial-year dating until the reign of [Diocletian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian)(reigned 284–305). Diocletian’s reforms included a massive increase in the scale of the imperial bureaucracy, which may have been a burden for late-Roman tax payers but which provides a gold mine for modern chronologists. The empire retained the tradition of naming each year in the civil calendar after the consuls, even though by this point the consulate was a purely ceremonial office. We have a complete list down to 541, and in the later empire we have plenty of humdrum legal documents using those consular dates allowing us to see the system in action.

One interesting aid to keeping track of time in during the empire is the obscure 15-year bureaucratic cycle in Roman Egypt known as the [indiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiction). his was the time when updates to existing tax rolls were mandated, and frequently an opportunity to changes in tax laws as well. Since there was a strong financial component to the system it was carefully maintained by the Roman state — in fact, many institutions in western Europe adopted this notation and continued to use it into the Middle Ages.

Perhaps the most important innovation in this period was the gradual adoption of serial year numbering, dating to Diocletian’s accession in 284. This was the first time in Roman history when the idea of numbered years familiar to ordinary people. [The Coptic Church in Egypt has used the Diocletianic year sequence ever since](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_calendar), though they refer to it as the “Era of Martyrs” thanks to Diocletian’s persecutions (the same calendar is also used in Ethiopia). This answer was written on __Baramouda 24, 1738__ in the Coptic calendar.

Our modern calendar was based on the supposed birth of Jesus in 1 AD — but that year chosen as the first of that era was, essentially, [guesstimated by a Byzantine monk named Dionysius Exiguus](https://www.quora.com/If-we-assume-people-in-100-AD-did-not-know-the-year-accurately-when-did-humankind-start-to-record-dates-consistently-relative-to-our-calendar-now/answer/Steve-Theodore) as a re-basing of the existing Diocletian calendar. In the eastern half of the empire, however, the “start date” was reset to what was believed to be the biblical date of the creation of the world — which was dated by Byzantine theologians to 5509 BC. The Byzantine empire officially adopted this _Etos Kosmou_ or “year of the creation” dating system in 691 and it survived as the dating system of the Orthodox Church down to 1728. Thoughout this period the Roman calendar continued to use Caesars’ reformed calendar, so it gained one day relative to the solar year every 128 years. However modern chronologists are familiar with the calculations so the translation between these two sets of dates is straightforward.

__TLDR__ 

Rome’s institutional longevity makes most Roman chronology fairly easy to work with. There are solid touch points to other traditions, starting with the various Greek calendars and eventually moving forward to the Islamic, Armenian and Syriac ones. The annual consul lists provide a highly reliable dating registry from around 200 BC down to the 9th or 10th century in the east, with a solid astronomical correlations offered by Ptolemy’s canon.

Most ancient societies aren’t nearly so lucky.
