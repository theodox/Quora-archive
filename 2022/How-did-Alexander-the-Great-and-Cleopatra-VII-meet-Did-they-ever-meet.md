No, they were nine generations apart. Alexander died two and a half centuries before she was born.

Cleopatra was descended from Alexander’s friend and companion [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter). The ancient rumor mill claimed that Ptolemy may have been a half-brother of Alexander’s although this was and remains speculation.
