Obsessive gaming is frequently a _symptom_  of depression.

I’ve seen this in several people I know. Depression frequently manifests itself as a cycle of social withdrawal and isolation; games facilitate that urge. Undemanding computer interactions are a comfort compared to the complex and intimidating world of human beings.

For some people games are a kind of self-medication — a way to tune out recurrent thoughts you can’t otherwise escape. For others, games offer an environment that can be controlled and predicted in ways that the real world cannot.

If you feel like games are making you depressed, it’s more likely the other way around. Games are entertainment, not therapy.
