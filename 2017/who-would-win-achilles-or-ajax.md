Achilles is always portrayed in the poem as the greatest warrior on the Greek side — it’s his presence that spells victory on the field, and when he sulks in his tent the entire Greek army is imperiled. Achilles is always “[best of the Achaeans](https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/nagy/BofATL/chapter2.html)”.

_Achilles (left) and Ajax (right) playing draughts_ 

Ajax (big Ajax, “Telamonian Ajax”) is a bigger and perhaps a stronger man that Achilles but his qualities are basically defensive: like the giant tower shield he carries he is a bulwark to the other Greeks but he doesn’t inspire fear in the Trojans or audacity in the other Greeks the way Achilles does. Achilles’ importance is underscored by the fact that the appearance of Patroclus dressed in Achilles’ armor is enough to turn the tide of battle.

Ajax fights Hector twice, once to a draw and once being forced to retreat after Hector disarms him. Achilles, of course, beats Hector in single combat.

Ajax is definitely a contender for second place in the eyes of the other Greeks. When Achilles died, he and Odysseus competed to be awarded Achilles’ armor. Odysseus won, the story goes (and Ajax killed himself in chagrin). However they were competing to fill Achilles’ vacant place — something they never tried to do while he was alive.
