The best resource would be the dynastic king list of [Manetho](https://pharaoh.se/manetho-king-list), who was a native Egyptian but who wrote in Greek. Most of his names are preserved in later Greek writers, particularly Eusebius, so that will give you a bunch of examples. The Latin versions will be pretty simple to derive from the Greek.

Many of Manethos transcriptions are pretty straightforward and phonetic:
Aθωθις _Athothis_ = [Aha](https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Aha)
Toσoρθρoς _Tosorthros =_ [Djoser](https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Djoser)
Aφοβις _Aphobis_  = [Apepi](https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Apepi)
Ταρκος, _Tarcus_  = [Taharqa](https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Taharqa)
Ψαμμητιχος, _Psammetichus_  = [Psamtik](https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Psamtik-I)
Νεχαω, _Nechao =_ [Necho](https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Necho-II)

Others however are not, and it’s not clear where they come from. Some seem to be regnal names, or cultic titles, but others may be Egyptian language nicknames or even may be Greek scribal errors in Manetho’s text. Here’s a few famous ones that don’t match up easily.

Χεβρως, _Chebros =_ [Thutmose](https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Thutmose-II)
Ραψακης, _Rapsaces =_ [Ramesses](https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Ramesses-II) 
Νεφελχερης, _Nephelcheres_  = [Amenemnesut](https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Amenemnesut)

[The full list](https://pharaoh.se/africanus-king-list), however, will give you a better example of how the Greeks thought it should be done than anything else.

For mythological figures, Plutarch’s [De Iside et Osiride](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0239) covers quite a few familiar gods and goddesses.
