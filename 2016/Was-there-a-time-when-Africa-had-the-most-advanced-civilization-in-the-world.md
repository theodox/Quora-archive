You could make a pretty good case on behalf of Egypt during the [Eighteenth Dynasty.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt) Certainly there was no contemporary civilization that could really match Egypt’s material wealth and political clout during that timeframe.

Egypt’s main rivals in the general neighborhood, the Hittites and the Assyrians, were busy contending with the Mitanni — who lay more or less in between all 3 powers — where Egypt was generally secure in its borders. This was also the most outward looking period in Egypt’s history, with Egyptian armies and traders venturing as far south as the Horn of Africa and as far north as modern Turkey.

Of course “advanced” begs a lot of questions: does good poetry count more than, say, high-quality geometry? Does a stable but ultra-conservative monarchy count more than an unstable republic? Is imperialism a sign of power and history-making clout, or of venality and aggression? Civilizations are like people : comparing them in _general_  says more about the tastes of the person making the comparison than it does about the subjects.
