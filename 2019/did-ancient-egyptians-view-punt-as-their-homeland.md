No.

Punt was always seen as an exotic destination, an exotic, far-off land full of wonders about which people were not really very specific. In [The Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor](https://www.ancient.eu/article/180/the-tale-of-the-shipwrecked-sailor-an-egyptian-epi/) — which was written during the Middle Kingdom when trade was still comparatively common — Punt is described as a kind of paradise, blessed with marvelous food…

> Then I stretched out my legs to know what I could place in my mouth. I found figs and grapes there. Leeks were ruler there. Sycamore figs were there together with notched Sycamore figs. Cucumbers were there as though cultivated. Fish were there together with birds. There was nothing that was not within it.

But also ruled by a 30-cubit long talking snake:

> I uncovered my face and found that it was a snake that was coming. It was thirty cubits long. His beard, it was greater than two cubits long. His body was overlaid with gold. His eyebrows were real lapis lazuli. He was bent up in front. He opened his mouth to me while I was on my belly in his presence. He said to me, "Who brought you? Who brought you, commoner, who brought you? If you fail to tell me who brought you to this island I will cause you to know yourself, you being as ashes having become as one who is not seen.”

The shipwrecked sailor doesn’t get his good by trade, but by the gift of the talking snake:

> Then I placed myself upon my belly my arms bent in respect before him. Then he gave to me a quantity of myrrh, heknu oil, laudanum, hesayt spice, tishpes spice, perfume, eye-paint, giraffes' tails, great lumps of incense, elephants' tusks, greyhounds, monkeys, baboons and all kinds of precious things. Then I loaded them upon this boat. It happened as I placed myself on my belly to give thanks to him that he said to me, "Behold, you will approach home in two months. You will be full, you will embrace your children, you will be young in the home where you will be buried."

So even when Egyptians were fairly regular visitors to Punt it was an exotic, quasi-magical destination, a kind of Red Sea Shangri-La. It was often referred to as _Ta Netjer,_ the “Land of the Gods”.

The last recorded Egyptian visit to Punt was in the reign of [Ramesses III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_III) — after that Egypt had more pressing worries to the north and east and trade with Punt seems to have ceased altogther; for later Egyptians Punt’s other-worldly identity completely eclipsed any pragmatic associations. Long after Egyptians stopped going to Punt, it still [showed up in poetry](https://egyptcentre.blogspot.com/2012/02/):

> _When I hold my love close_ 
_(and her arms steal around me),_ 
_I'm like a man translated to Punt_ 
_or like someone out in the reedflats_ 
_When the whole world suddenly bursts into flower._ 
_In this dreamland of South Sea fragrances,_ 
_My love, you are essence of roses._ 

Some older scholarship though that the label _Ta Netjer_ implied that the Egyptians assigned some kind of historic origin story to Punt — that it was a sort of Eden from which the original Egyptians sprang. This view is not common in modern mainstream scholarship anymore. Among other things _Ta Netjer_  is applied to other places too, as long as those places were favored with rare and valuable commodities (so, for example, the mountain forests of Lebanon, abounding in precious hardwoods, were also _Ta Netjer)._ So, it’s unlikely that the label has any special historic meaning beyond “wealthy” and “exotic”.
