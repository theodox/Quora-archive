Well, they had a very precise understanding of what one looked like and felt like on the receiving end.

The modern vulcanologists use the term “[Plinian eruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plinian_eruption)” to describe high-altitude, high-pressure eruptions. These are named for the Roman naturalist [Pliny the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder), who dictated observations of the eruption of mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Pliny died leading a Roman fleet that which tried to rescue survivors from the stricken area. Pliny’s original notes are lost but his, nephew Pliny the Younger summarized them in his letters to the historian Tacitus, [which describe the series of catastrophes in vivid detail.](http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/pompeii.htm)

That said, Roman and Greek science never had a theoretical framework that could explain the workings of volcanoes in more than an impressionistic or analogical way. The many dangers of volcanoes were well known but the actual mechanism by which the earth quaked, lava flowed or gases were emitted were beyond the abilities of Romans to guess. The connection to subterranean “rivers of fire” was made at least as far back as the time of Plato. One of the better (though still mistaken) theories was the idea that the underground fires were fed by a mixture of bitumen (basically, asphalt) and sulfur.

A surprisingly common theory was that eruptions were produced by violent underground winds. Probably the most vivid description of this idea is recorded by the poet Lucretius, describing Mt. Etna in Sicily:

> Now I will show 
how that inferno is suddenly roused
and bursts out from those immense furnaces
of Etna. First of all, the whole mountain
is naturally hollow underneath,
supported everywhere on basalt caves. 
And in all these caves there is wind and air.
For air is transformed into wind once stirred
and set in motion. When this wind gets hot
and, as it rages, heats up all the rocks
it makes contact with in its surroundings
and the ground, as well, and draws out from them
a searing fire with swift flames, it rises,
hurling itself high up and thus straight through
the mountain’s jaws. And thus it carries heat 
long distances, scatters its glowing ash 
over a huge area, and rolls out
thick, dark, murky smoke, while at the same time
tossing up boulders of amazing weight.
One cannot doubt that these things manifest
the stormy force of air. Then, too, the sea
for the most part diminishes its waves
on that mountain’s lower slopes and withdraws
its tide. Caverns extend under the ground
all the way from this sea to the deep mouth
of the mountain. Through these, we must assume, 
[air enters combined with water, for] facts
compel us [to believe that air comes in
from] the open sea and moves deep inside.
It then blows out, thus pushing up the flames
hurling out rocks, and raising clouds of sand.
For at the summit there are what those men
name craters—features we call jaws and mouths.

> _De Rerum Natura, VI.680ff_ 

Now, to modern ears “violent winds producing volcanic eruptions” might sound a bit odd. However the basic idea is a lot easier to understand if you substitute the more technical-sounding “highly compressed gasses.” As often in ancient science the lack of specialist vocabulary sometimes turns perfectly valid observations into something that seems very naive.

Another seeming oddity is the role of the sea. Lucretius’s description implies that that the sea near mount Etna creates a kinds of pump effect which forces pressurized air into the substructure of the volcano until it is released in a tremendous rush. Although (conditioned by lots of color photography) we have hard time imagining some kind of connection between vulcanism and the sea, this idea makes a good deal of intuitive sense if you’ve ever seen a ‘blowhole’ on a volcanic island where air is forced up through the roof of a one-time lava bubble.
