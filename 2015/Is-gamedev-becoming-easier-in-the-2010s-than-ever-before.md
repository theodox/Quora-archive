From a technical standpoint, yes. 

I'm not exaggerating for effect when I say that I've seen many high school kids produce Unity games that compare favorably in technical quality with AAA console games of the XBox/PS2 generation and compete pretty well against 360/PS3 era games. The commodification of 3d graphics and the standardization of many techniques in AI, networking and other areas. Combined with the huge leaps in computing power (my iPhone is _way_  beefier than a $50,000 graphics workstation from the 90's) the act of creating a game is far easier than it has ever been.

From the standpoint of earning a living, game development is harder now than it has been since the early 90's. 

All that widely diffused technical power means there are vastly more games being produced than ever before. That's great for the artform -- it's given us lots of inventive new titles and whole genres that would never have been greenlit by publishers in decades past. It's tough, however, if you make a living making games: the field has become extremely crowded and competitive. The games that stand out have either got huge marketing machines behind them (think _Angry Birds)_  or huge budgets (_Destiny, Grand Theft Auto)_ . There are certainly breakout Indie games -- but that approach has the same risk/reward ratio as going into acting, music or professional sports. Its exhilarating - but not a safe business or a comfy living.
