I'm kind of split. In practice the Roman empire was the most resilient of the 4 cited here: despite it's flaws, some form of Roman polity endured for 2,000 years (I'm counting the East Roman 'Byzantine' empire of course): by contrast none of the others lasted for even 500. For sheer longevity they are in a league of their own. Given the array of powerful enemies they outlasted they seem to deserve the title of most tenacious.

However, there's a case to be made (with [Kevin Flint](https://www.quora.com/profile/Kevin-Flint) ) that the British Empire was a stronger, more flexible institution than it's predecessors: it certainly persevered with far greater institutional stability than the others, with only two significant interregna (the English Civil War of 1649 and the Glorious Revolution of 1688). The British Empire also thrived in a world where nationalist ideologies were powerful and widespread: the Romans, Greeks and Mongols ruled in eras when rule by strangers was the norm, rather than a widely disliked exception. Despite that handicap -- and despite the accelerated pace of social change in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries the British Empire managed to survive without a forcible interruption: even its effective dissolution after WWII was more or less peaceful and consensual in contrast to the repeated succession crises and civil wars which wracked all of their predecessors.
