__Step One:__ 

Can you, with all your superior knowledge but with no reference books or power tools


 build a [boat than can safely sail from Norway to Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knarr)?

 [figure out the circumference of the earth?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes)

make [concrete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_concrete)? 

[Get from hawaii to tahiti without a map or compass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesian_navigation)?


create [paper or gunpowder](http://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/focus/inventions.htm)?

And, unlike your ancestors, you know that all of these things are possible, and might even have some idea of how, in theory, they work. So just try to imagine how smart and determined those folks were to do these things -- and a whole lot more -- in a world without printed books or the internet, where most people didn't have enough to eat or a spare set of clothes. 

The first step toward achieving humility is realizing that whatever "we" can do, _you personally_  are definitely not as smart as the folks who did these things. _You just have more second hand information_ . You're like a teenager who is two seasons ahead of Stephen Hawking watching __Breaking Bad:__  having more facts is not the same thing as being more intelligent or more perceptive.

__Step two:__ 
 
Go watch the news for a week. 

Do you really feel like we've learned all there is to know about living together on this planet? Is the generation that's given history Miley Cyrus, ISIS, and school shootings really so wise that it has nothing to learn?

__Step three:__ 

Try actually reading the books you're talking about. 

It's hard: they weren't written for you, they were written for people long dead, whose lives were very different from yours. Old books always sound deceptively simple. Nowadays we've got 10,000 years of borrowed concepts we can dress up academic jargon - it' s more precise for the technically inclined, and it keeps the commoners from asking inconvenient questions. When Plato makes Thrasymachus say



> Listenâ€”I say that justice is nothing other than the advantage of the stronger.


He doesn't have the verbiage, but he's just being very succinct about something like



> The discourse of justice is contextualized in and ultimately dependent upon a system of dominant-submissive social relations; the conceptual apparatus is deployed solely for the advantage of the dominant class and exists only to legitimize and render more efficient the dominant class's hegemonic status.


only without the sanctifying effect of fancy verbiage. Us moderns are often hard put to read anything thats not wrapped in multi-syllabic jargon, but the old folks had to invent the ideas first and wait for the technical terms to follow. Sometimes it is useful to have a modern guide along with you - notes or a good introduction - since everything is in translation and you'll be missing the subtleties. 

Mostly it's important to read attentively and think it through, instead of just expecting wisdom to roll out of the pages like the news crawl under the stock ticker on TV. Insight never comes that way, not today and not in millennia past.
