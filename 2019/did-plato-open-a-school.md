It depends how narrowly you defined “school.” He created a stable group of students, who met in the tony Athenian suburb known the [Akademeia](https://www.quora.com/Was-Platos-Academy-founded-outside-the-walls-of-Athens-because-it-wasnt-allowed-inside-Athens/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=1d25744f&srid=zLvM). This is the source of the name “Platonic Academy” as well as English worlds like _academic._

_This modern museum sits on the site of the Platonic Academy in Athens (it may not the one where Plato himself taught, but a later incarnation of the same institution). I personally have a hard time imagining that this building would have passed Plato’s test for_ __τò καλόν__ _, The Beautiful — ancient Greek had no word for “recycled shipping container.” Photo:_ _[Plato-Academy.gr](http://www.plato-academy.gr/en/web/guest/mo_museum)_ 

The Academy met on a regular basis for lectures and discussions, so in that sense the group resembled a school. However you could describe it with equal justice as a kind of aristocratic social club: at least in Plato’s time you didn’t pay to attend, but you had to come from a social class (and, usually, gender) which allowed you to spend all day discussing The Good and The Beautiful to the exclusion of, say, earning a living.

During Plato’s lifetime and for some generations thereafter the Academy did not charge for lessons. In part this reflected the aristocratic social basis of the group — the academics were at pains to distinguish themselves from the many [sophists](https://www.iep.utm.edu/sophists/) who taught public speaking and legal argumentation for money, a profession that aristocrats like Plato saw as vulgar and undignified.

The informal grouping eventual did become a permanent institution. The original academy was destroyed by the Roman general Sulla in 86 BC, about three centuries after Plato. A revived version emerged in the Roman period, and [lasted down to the year 536 when it was shuttered by the emperor Justinian](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Emperor-Justinian-close-the-revived-Platonic-Academy).

Ironically (as [David Moore](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Moore-408) might say) for much of its life the Academy was devoted to a highly skeptical, anti-foundational approach to philosophy which was about as diametrically opposed to Plato’s ideas as possible. One imagines he, John Harvard, and Eli Yale have a lot to talk about wherever they are.
