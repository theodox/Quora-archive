# When Alexander the Great began invading the Achaemenid Empire in 334 B.C.E, what was the first city he went for? Did he go straight to Persepolis, or did he work his way through other smaller cities first?

He fought his way down through Asia Minor (the battles of [the Granicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Granicus) and [Issus)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Issus) but then turned south into first Phoenicia and thence to Egypt.

This detour makes a good deal of sense for two reasons. First, there was a large Persian garrison in Egypt; leaving it behind him as he headed east would have been an invitation to trouble. Secondly, Egypt was deeply resentful of the Persians (the Persians had conquered Egypt twice, first in 525 BC and again in 343 — only a decade before Alexander. Alexander correctly expected a warm welcome in Egypt, which he captured with very little fighting because the Persian garrison was cut off from help and surrounded by a hostile populace. This left him with a well-defended rear and the wealth of Egypt to help pay for his armies.

After organizing Egypt he turned east again. It appears that he was looking for Darius, not trying to capture cities (if he were trying to grab urban areas he’d have headed down the Euphrates to Babylon, rather than heading northeast towards what’s now Kurdistan. After defeating the Persians at Arbela, he did scoop up Babylon, which again helped to protect his rear and ensure his financial lifeline.

After that Alexander rolled up the Persian capitals pretty much as he came to them. The capitals were important because they were storehouses of wealth, but other cities were few and militarily irrelevant. Alexander was primarily concerned with having money to pay his soldiers and with bringing Darius to a decisive battle.

Susa came first (it was the closest to Babylon, and was connected to it by a main Persian road). Then Persepolis, which only fell after the hardest battle of the campaign, the [Battle of the Persian Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Persian_Gate), a kind of ‘Thermopylae in reverse’ in the mountain passes. Ecbatana was the last important Persian stronghold, but the Persians abandoned it hoping to regroup in the plains of Bactria. However by this point the Persians were fighting among themselves; Darius was murdered by one of his own satraps and the war was effectively over.
