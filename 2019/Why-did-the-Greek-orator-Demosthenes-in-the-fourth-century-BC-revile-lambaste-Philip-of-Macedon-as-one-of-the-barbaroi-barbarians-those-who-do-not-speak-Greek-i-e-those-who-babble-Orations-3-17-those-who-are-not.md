# Why did the Greek orator Demosthenes, in the fourth century BC, revile & lambaste Philip of Macedon as one of the barbaroi (“barbarians,” those who do not speak Greek, i.e., those who babble; Orations 3.17) those who are not Greek?

We can’t know for sure that Demosthenes thought his audience would buy this as a literal description, but his motive for saying it was abundantly clear: he was trying to motivate people to hate Philip.

This speech is usually known formally as the [Third Olynthiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olynthiacs) — one of a series of three speeches Demosthenes gave in 349 BC as he tried to convince his countrymen to support the [Chalcidian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcidian_League) (headquartered in the city of Olynthus) against the Macedonians. He succeeded, though the effort turned out to be a disaster: Philip didn’t have to defeat the Olynthians, instead he took the city by bribery and destroyed it, including the Athenian garrison which went in response to Demosthenes’s call.

Demosthenes was the leader of the anti-Macedonian faction in Athens, and his commentary on Macedonian ethnicity has to be taken with a certain level of skepticism. He definitely does call Philip a barbarian (here, and also in the [Third Philippic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Philippic)) but since it’s clearly intended as a kind of demonization it’s best not to treat it as neutral ethnography.

It is significant that he thinks the charge might stick: it’s a charge which, however motivated, would be laughable if leveled at Thebans or Spartans. Perhaps the best way to understand it is that in 4th century Athens, anyway, Macedonians occupied a position that was sufficiently ambiguous that an anti-Macedonian could try to paint them as barbarians. Whether that accusation was something that most Athenians reflexively agreed with, however, we lack the evidence to know. You could analogize it to the endlessly debated question of [whether or not Russia is a “European” country.](https://www.rbth.com/arts/327309-is-russia-europe-or-asia)

In any case, the standard of truth in these highly politicized speeches is always suspect: Demosthenes’s perennial rival, [Aeschines,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeschines) used to claim that Demosthenes _himself_ was a barbarian, thanks to a Scythian grandmother — a charge which, needless to say, Demosthenes hotly denied.
