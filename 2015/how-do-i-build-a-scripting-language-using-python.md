Before getting down to implementation details, does this seem more like an "internal" or an "external" DSL? 

If that doesn't make sense you might want to check out [Domain Specific Languages](http://martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html) before getting too deep into the details - it's a good source for the general issues in designing special-purpose languages.
