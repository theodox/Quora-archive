Yes, although it was rather a waste of time and resources.

The __[A4B](http://www.russianspaceweb.com/a4b.html)__ ____ was a descendant of V-2 which was a testbed for several ideas. The minimal version was essentially a glide-capable version of the V2 — instead of being purely ballistic, it sported wings to give it additional range. This was planned as a counter to the loss of launch sites closer to Britain.

A4B’s were never used operationally, only two test launches were attempted before the fall of the Reich.

However, before the A4B program reached testing it was realized that you could ‘stack’ rockets to create a multi-stage vehicle with, it was hoped, intercontinental range. The official name was the __[A9](http://www.astronautix.com/a/a9a10.html)__ __/A10__ but the intention was clear from the unsubtle codename, “__Projekt Amerika__ ”. The project was mostly a paper exercise while the war’s outcome remained in doubt, but as German fortunes began to crumble the Amerika project was revived — it was optimistically slated for a 1946 release and would probably have carried a biological or chemical payload.

The A9 proper was to have been a streamlined, manned variation of the A4B as a second stage — the Germans understood that they did not have the technology for anything like accuracy at intercontinental distances so the plan was that a pilot would take over manual control using the glide capabilities of the A4B towards a target. The plan was presumably for the pilot to bail out at the last minute, though by the time the project was on the drawing boards the level of ambient madness in German planning circles was so high that manned suicide missiles would hardly have been a stretch. The A10 was a booster stage, essentially the engines of 4 V2s in a bulkier fuselage, intended to get the A9 to about 400km.

There were several other theoretical designs as well — the last three years of the Nazi era were a fertile time for fantasy weapons intended to reverse the course of the war in a single stroke. Luckily none of it worked, but it has provided[ a certain level of vicarious thrills for later generations](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/06/22/have-you-played-secret-weapons-of-the-luftwaffe/).
