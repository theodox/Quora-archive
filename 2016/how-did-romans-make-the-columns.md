The most common kind of Roman column was created from segments rather than carved whole. That made the transportation and assembly far easier. Plus, monolithic columns are extremely expensive, and it's easy for an accident to damage one: with smaller pieces the risks are lower and s single dropped round won't send you all the way back to the quarry. This was particularly important because most columns were not perfect cylinders: the Romans borrowed the Greek practice of _[entasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entasis)_ __ or tapering to keep the colonnades from looking too rigid and foreshortened by perspective:

So, segments or 'drums' made a lot more sense than solid columns. Here's a fairly intact Roman temple from Jordan showing the segmentation pretty clearly and a few fallen segments at left).

The segments were held together with metal pegs and clamps, or sometimes by filling the holes running down the column with molten lead or iron: You can see the peg-holes here

 However for really big prestige projects the Romans also went in for monolithic columns. These were vastly more complex and expensive to erect, even though they were simply shaped blocks of stone. 

The most beautiful assembly of monolithic columns still standing is perhaps the [Pantheon, Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome)

Here's a treadmill-powered crane (left) lifting a smallish monolithic column (center) into place (note the workers inside the treadmill)

Doing this on a big column was a huge enterprise. To get a sense of how big, here's a 4th century description of the raising of a 450 ton Egyptian obelisk in Rome for Emperor Constantius II:

> now there remained only the raising, which it was thought could be accomplished only with great difficulty, perhaps not at all. But it was done in the following manner: to tall beams which were brought and raised on end like a grove of derricks, were fastened long and heavy ropes in the likeness of a manifold web to hide the sky with their excessive numbers. To these were attached that veritable mountain, and it was gradually drawn upon high through the empty air, and after hanging for a long time, while many thousand men turned wheels resembling millstones, it was finally placed in the middle of the circus

The obelisk was placed in the Circus Maximus, though at some point during Rome's medieval nadir it fell over. Pope Sixtus V had it restored and moved to the Lateran Palace, where it's famous today as the [Lateran Obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateran_Obelisk) .

 Interestingly the Renaissance raising took about 900 laborers: rather less than the Roman version recorded by Ammianus Marcellinus: that suggests that by 1588 the Italian engineers had surpassed their Roman ancestors.
