Hoplite-style formation fighting required each soldier to cover half of his own body and half of his neighbors with his shield. This means that everyone in the formation has to bear arms in the same hand — otherwise there would be a gap. Traditionally the right of the battle-line was the position of honor, because it was the position of greatest danger: the rightmost soldier in line was not covered by a comrade.

Most people are right handed (and in both Greece and Rome, [left-handedness was viewed with suspicion](https://historydaily.org/why-does-left-mean-wrong): our word “sinister” comes from Latin for “left”). So it’s hardly surprising that the dominant hand was used for the tricky business of managing a spear while the less dextrous hand held the less mobile shield.

_Dexter,_ incidentally, is Latin for “right” — again, that anti-lefty prejudice was deep.
