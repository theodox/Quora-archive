Yes, unfortunately, there is.

The literary tradition about Carthaginian child sacrifice predates Carthaginian-Roman conflict. The practice was first reported by the Greeks of Sicily, who were also rivals of the Carthaginians; the oldest recorded stories go back about 50 years before the Punic wars. Later Greek-historians claimed that the peace treaty which ended the war of Himera (480 BC, so more than 200 years before the Roman-Carthaginian conflict) [prohibited child sacrifice in Sicily](http://www.attalus.org/old/sayings1.html#175).

It’s true that[ the Greek-Carthaginian rivalry was just as bitter as the Roman-Carthaginian one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Wars), so the potential motivation for slander is the same: however the stories cover a span of about three hundred years and include multiple episodes that are specific to different times and places — this is not just a generic blood libel. It’s probably significant that the allegations were repeated by Philo of Byblos, who wrote in Greek but was a Phoenician who discussed the same practice in his own homeland.

In any case, the archaeology backs up the literary accounts. Carthaginian burial grounds (in their colonies as well as in Carthage proper) include special areas where small children are interred. Many of these burials are accompanied by inscriptions like _“To the Lord Ba'al Hammon, the vow that [Name] vowed”_ or, in some cases, explicit mentions of sacrifice.

_This inscription from the Carthage tophet appears to read “The sacrifice of a human of his own flesh” Inscription reading and photo from from M. G. Amadas i Guzzo – J. Á. Zamora López,_ _[The Epigraphy of the Tophet](http://*https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270501350_The_Epigraphy_of_the_Tophet* (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270501350_The_Epigraphy_of_the_Tophet))_ 

There are definitely some archaeologists who want to interpret this as something other than evidence of child sacrifice — a neonatal cemetery, for instance. Unfortunately that view is probably based more on wishful thinking than on the evidence. Between the three key pieces — the literary tradition, the infant burials, and the inscriptions — the traditional account is probably correct in outline. There may be all sorts of complexities we don’t understand, but the bare facts seem to be that the worst case is true.
