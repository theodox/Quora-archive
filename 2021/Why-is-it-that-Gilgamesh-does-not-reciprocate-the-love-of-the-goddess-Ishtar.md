Ishtar is pretty bad news for mortals — even for “[2/3 divine](https://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/1835/why-is-gilgamesh-considered-to-be-one-third-human-and-two-third-god)” mortals like Gilgamesh. In the poem he describes her as

> a half-door that keeps out neither breeze nor blast,
a palace that crushes down valiant warriors,
an elephant who devours its own covering,
pitch that blackens the hands of its bearer,
a waterskin that soaks its bearer through,
limestone that buckles out the stone wall,
a battering ram that attracts the enemy land,
a shoe that bites its owner's feet!

(all quotes, [Tablet VI, Kovacs translation](http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/gilgamesh/tab6.htm))

He’s got reason to be worried, because she has a bad track record. Gilgamesh knows what she did to [Tammuz](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Tammuz)* the shepherd

> You loved the Shepherd, the Master Herder,
who continually presented you with bread baked in embers,
and who daily slaughtered for you a kid.
Yet you struck him, and turned him into a wolf,
so his own shepherds now chase him
and his own dogs snap at his shins.

And to Ishullanu the date-farmer

> you struck him, turning him into a dwarf [or, “toad”]
and made him live in the middle of his (garden of) labors,
where the mihhu do not go up, nor the bucket of dates (?) down.

So Gilgamesh is not interested in getting in bed with Ishtar: it’s not a healthy occupation:

> And now me! It is me you love, and you will ordain for me as
for them!"

Ishtar was always an ambiguous goddess: although in later times she was confused by Greek observers with Aphrodite, she was not a cutesy goddess of romantic love. She presided over the passions, both positive and negative, being invoked for both love and warfare. She was mistress of fertility but also of destructives storms. Characteristically, her symbols included both doves and lions.

In other words: _bad girlfriend material_ .
