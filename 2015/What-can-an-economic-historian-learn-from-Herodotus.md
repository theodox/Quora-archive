There's a lot if you go for the anthropological/sociological side of economics, since he devotes a lot of time to the lifestyles and mores of cultures from Libya to Mesopotamia and from the Black Sea to Nubia. Not all of his information is equally good (a lot is second hand, and in many cases it seems like his interlocutors were pulling his leg) but it's much more than the stereotypical battles-and-kings recital, including both a lot of anecdotes and insights into a wide variety of lifestyles. Among other things the book is a testimony to the incredible diversity of social organizations in his world, from horse nomads to giant cities to trading enclaves to tribal societies of all stripes.

A couple of minor things off the top of my head: there's the story of [Croesus](http://www.ancient.eu/croesus/) of Lydia, who Herodotus believed was the first to coin standardized money. He shows up in Herodotus, first as a flashy vulgarian with lots of gold, then as a chastened wise man after his kingdom is destroyed by Cyrus. Herodotus does attest to having personally seen Croesus' gifts to Delphi, which is direct attestation both for Lydia's proverbial wealth and for international trade in religious prestige.

There's also an odd discussion of the finances of Babylon, where the (apocryphal) queen [Nitocris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitocris) left a practical joke for her successors whom she knew would eventually be tempted to open her tomb in search of money -- a comment both on greed and the low likelihood that 'buried treasures' really stayed buried, as we know quite well from Egyptian archaeology.

In this and in many other stories he demonstrates a characteristically Greek distrust for luxury and wealth (this is centuries before the conquests of Alexander, when the Romans thought the Greeks had been emasculated by luxury; significantly after the defeat of the Persians he imagines (?) a scene in which several Persian tribes decide to abandon the luxurious life of empire and re-dedicate themselves to a nomadic life like that of their (prouder, tougher) ancestors.

There are a bunch of great commentaries on Herodotus which will have a lot of detail for items that non-specialists might miss in the storytelling.
