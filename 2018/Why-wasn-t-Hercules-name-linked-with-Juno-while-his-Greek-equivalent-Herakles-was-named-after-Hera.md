We don’t really know for sure, but the likeliest answer is that they identifications of Italian divinities with their Greek counterparts did not happen all at once, or very systematically.

Heracles -> Hercules is a pretty straightforward borrowing of a personal name. Even in the Etruscan period Greek stories were circulating in the Italian peninsula, so it’s likely that Hercules came into Latin by the same process that ended up with scenes from the Iliad on the walls of Etruscan tombs.

Juno, on the the other hand, is more likely to come not directly from Greece but from a sort of Carthaginian-Italian syncretism that happened before Greek influence was widespread.

Before the foundation of the Republic, other Italian states like [Caere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caere) cemented their[ trade deals and alliances with Carthage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrgi_Tablets) under the patronage of _Uni-Astre_  ( ), a syncretic matchup of an Etruscan goddess [Uni ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uni_(mythology))with the Phoenician [Astarte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astarte). There’s some overlap between Uni-Astarte and Hera — both were patronesses of fertility — but some important differences as well, since Uni and Astarte are both also associated with war and with sovereignty. The misogyny implicit in the henpecking, aggrieved image of Greek Hera seems to be a uniquely Greek contribution.

Her Roman incarnation as [Juno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(mythology)) includes aspects that derive from Uni-Astarte, although some scholars see her origins in a much older Indo-European goddess who combined aspects of fertility, war and sovereignty. At any event Roman Juno was already a “Queen of the Gods,” part of the [Capitoline triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitoline_Triad), as the consort of Jupiter, before the need for harmonizing Italian and Greek stories came up. As Greek stories started circulating more widely in Italy the identification of Hera and Uni/Juno was easy to make but — unlike Heracles — there was already an existing and well-known figure who retained her existing name.

In later times Juno re-connected with her Carthaginian counterpart. Juno was identified with [Tanit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanit), the Carthaginian evolution of Astarte; the Romans knew Tanit as _Juno Caelestis._ The complex five-way identification of Uni-Astarted-Juno-Hera-Tanit formed the basis for Vergil’s story arc in the Aeneid where the dangerous and powerful patron goddess of Carthage is also the vengeful Greek shrew pursuing Aeneas on his flight from Troy.

__TLDR:__  Juno was a local. Hercules was a Greek immigrant…

… although he has an equally complicated double-life as the Phoenician god [Melqart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melqart), though that was mostly a Greek identification which the Romans picked up second hand. It is however how a hero from the Aegean ends up holding up the sky in the (Carthaginian-explored) Atlas Mountains and building his pillars in the (Carthaginian-owned) straights of Gades.
