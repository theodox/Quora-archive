They were named after (some of ) the Gods. The equivalences are not Greek inventions — they are borrowed from Babylonian astronomy, the Greek god name attached to the planets came from the [somewhat messy business of Greeks trying to map their pantheon onto the Babylonian one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretatio_graeca).

So basically, the Babylonians named the planets after their own gods; the Greeks came up with a matchup between their gods and the Babylonian versions. Then the Romans did the same thing to the Greek version. [In almost all European languages outside of Greek, the Latin versions became the common names](http://www.boskowan.com/www/jirka/vesmir/planets/accessories/names_en.htm), even though some languages clearly had indigenous names too.

That’s how we get [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(mythology)) where the Greeks had [Kronos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronus) — we are really talking about [Ninurta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninurta).
