This is probably the least idealized portrait of Caesar (many of the later ones, produced by his heirs, make him younger than this and give him more hair ). But you can judge for yourself.

One of the more flattering ones:

The originals were probably colored but we don’t have the original pigments. Here’s a modern reconstruction of a statue of Caesars nephew and adopted heir Octavian to give a sense of the colors.

Note that this is an educated guess, not a perfect reproduction : we know from literary source that Octavian’s hair was _subflavum_  or “almost blonde”. And there’s no guarantee that the skin tones are right even if they are authentic to the original — they could reflect what pigments were available and artistic conventions. The biographer Suetonius describes Caesar’s complexion as _candidus_ , “pale” and his eyes as dark.
