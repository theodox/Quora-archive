Apart from very early texts (which are sometimes purely pictographic) hieroglyphics encode the Egyptian language. To be a bit more exact, they encode first Old Egyptian (put to around 2100 BC) and then Middle Egyptian (from then until hieroglyphs fell out of use in the fourth century of our era). That’s a lot of linguistic history there: Middle Egyptian alone covers roughly half of the recorded history of humanity which is plenty of time for evolution and change even in ultra-conservative Egypt.

The Egyptian language sits in an interesting place. It is usually assigned to what’s called the [Afro-Asiatic language family](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Afro-Asiatic-languages) and it shares features with four other major language groupings: the Chadic languages of Central Africa, Berber, the Cushitic languages of the horn of Aftica, and Semitic languages like Arabic or Hebrew, but the relationships are not nearly as pronounced as they are among, say, Indo-European languages.

_The modern Afro-Asiatic language family. This is a modern map, so Egyptian proper is not on the list._ 

For simplicity’s sake it’s best to stick with Middle Egyptian, the language of most surviving hieroglyphics texts. If you need a proper grammar there’s a nice pro-sumer introduction [here ](https://www.bibalex.org/learnhieroglyphs/lesson/LessonDetails_En.aspx?l=9)and a college-level example [here.](https://ia801409.us.archive.org/16/items/HOCH1997MiddleEgyptianGrammarOCR/HOCH_1997_Middle%20Egyptian%20Grammar_OCR.pdf)

If you’re just looking for standout features, here are a few notable Egyptianisms in a simplified, not-good-enough-for-professionals form.

> Note: I did my best on hieroglyphic text entry, but proper vertical alignment of the characters eludes me.

__Word order__ 

Egyptian is word-order based, more or less like English. The order for a standard sentence is VSO, or verb-subject-object.

___Iw___ 

Many Egyptian sentences start with the word _iw._ The meaning of _iw_ is not entirely clear: it’s some kind of marker for the beginning of a simple statement, but the precise implications aren’t obvious. It is typically left untranslated as in 𓇋𓅱𓀀𓅓𓉐 ___iw.i m pr___ __ “I am in [the] house.”

__Suffix pronouns__ 

Egyptian pronouns like “he” or “they” are suffixes. In the example above ___iw.i___ has the pronoun suffix __.i__ , meaning “I.”

__Missing to-be verbs__ 

Like Latin, there are cases where a sentence does not need to explicitly express a form of “to be.” So you can say something like 𓇋𓅱𓊃𓀀𓅓𓉐 ___iw s m pr___ __ “[the] man [is] in [the] house” and it’s grammatical.

> You may note that in the first example above 𓀀 is transliterated “.i” but in the second 𓊃𓀀 is “s”. This is classic hieroglyphics: the same symbol 𓀀 is either the word for “I” or a marker indicating “male” — in the second sentence 𓊃 provides the sound “s” and the 𓀀 indicates that “s” in this case means the male pronoun “he” rather than door-bolt (also pronounced with an “s”) which the character represents.

__Gendered verbs__ 

Like a lot of languages Egyptian verbs distinguish between persons (“I” / “you” / “he-she-it”) and numbers (“I” vs “we”). However Egyptian also adds a gender marker to the third person verbal forms, so “he said” and “she said” are represented by different endings, 𓆓𓂧𓈖𓆑 _ḏd.n.f_ and 𓆓𓂧𓈖𓋴 _ḏd.n.s_ respectively. Since the endings are the same as the pronoun suffixes, this is something like “said he”, “said she.”

__Aspects and constructions__ 

Egyptian verbs don’t map very precisely onto English ones: there are fewer tenses, but several other constructions provide information which English verbs do not. Explaining these in detail is beyond my meager powers but here’s a grammatical table for the verb _ḏd,_ “say” to point out the complexity.

Notable features here include the [stative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stative_verb) and [terminative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessative_aspect) aspects and the contingent tense (which applies to actions which depend on some other condition being true (in English we re-use the future or subjunctive for this sort of thing).

__Negative relatives__ 

Like English, Middle Egyptian has the relative construction (the “who” in “the man who came do dinner” or the “which” in “the boat which left the harbor”). But interestingly Egyptian has a negative version of the same construction: so ___st ntt im___ “The woman who is there” but also __st iwtt im__ , “the woman who is not there”.

__No “and”__ 

Egyptian generally has no word that corresponds to “and.” Instead of “figs and grapes” you’d say ___dȝb iȝrrt___ “figs grapes”

> The ball and sticks are a non-spoken plural marker, the fourth character is a picture of a grapevine, but it’s here used as a determinative reminding people both ___dȝb___ and ___iȝrrt___ are fruits.
