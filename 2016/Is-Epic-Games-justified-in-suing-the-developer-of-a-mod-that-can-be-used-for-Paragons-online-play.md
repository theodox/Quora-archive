I’m not qualified to offer an opinion on the jurisdictional question (how does a California company sue a German user?) which might be legally decisive.

That said, I have a hard time believing this is not a flaming violation of the terms of service that the modder accepted to get into the beta. While EULAs in general often contain dubious assertions of rights by companies, this one seems pretty clear: you’re not allowed into the beta if you copy the software or use if for commercial purposes — both of which the modder has done.

Beyond the EULA, the fact that the modder is charging money for his mod makes it seem more actionable as well — copyright law makes it very difficult to profit off of other people’s IP without their consent. Although the boundaries of that space are very complicated (think of that [John Deere ](http://www.wired.com/2015/04/dmca-ownership-john-deere/)nonsense from last year), this seems like a clear effort to make money off clearly copyrighted material in explicit opposition to a copyright owner’s wishes and without their permission. And — unlike the John Deere case — this isn’t a case of using copyright law to turn ordinary purchases into a covert lease. It seems to me like somebody lying about their intentions to gain privileged access to software and using that access to rip off the software company for profit is in the same realm as violating an NDA or selling cracks of DRM’ed software.
