Besides academic and personal use, Latin is still the language of record for the Catholic Church — for example, here’s [the Latin version of Pope Francis’ official communications](http://www.vatican.va/latin/popes_latin/franciscus/latin_hf_fr.html.). And there are still some official uses for Latin in multi-language Switzerland (or, more properly, the[ Confoederatio Helvetica](http://official-name-abbreviations-meaning.all-about-switzerland.info/)).

The Living Latin movement fosters spoken Latin for students as an antidote to the excessive focus on translation typical in schools. You can get a sense of what spoken Latin sounds like from sources like [Evan Milner’s Latinum Youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEekt9eu1g-yEGq6XUlRSIg)
