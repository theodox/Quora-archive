Here’s Ptolemy’s (somewhat creepy) family tree, going back to the first father of the first Ptolemy — a Macedonian named Lagos. During his Ptolemy I’s lifetime it was widely suggested that Ptolemy’s real father was Philip of Macedon; either way there’s plenty of Macedonians and no Africans between Ptolemy VIII and Ptolemy I. In fact, Ptolemy VIII is about as Ptolemy as one can get, since his parents and grandparents were both brother-sister marriages.
