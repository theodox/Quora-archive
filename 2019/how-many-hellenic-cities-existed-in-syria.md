It’s actually a bit hard to count, because the Greek era in Syria lasted a long time: almost 900 years. Cities rose and fell and some were even destroyed and refounded.

The most important Hellenic center wasn’t really a city; it was the region in northwest Syria contaning [Antioch](https://www.ancient.eu/Antiochia/), [Apamea,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apamea,_Syria) [Laodicea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laodicea_in_Syria) and [Seleucia Pieria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucia_Pieria) (not to be confused with the much larger [Seleucia-on-the-Tigris in Iraq](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-Seleucia-the-ancient-capital-city-of-the-Seleucids?ch=10&share=49c98f24&srid=zLvM)). This region (the “Syrian tetrapolis”) was densely populated and prosperous. Antioch proper was probably the third most populous city in the Mediterranean world (after Rome and Alexandria).

Inland, the most important center was [Beroea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo#Classical_antiquity) (modern Aleppo).

The Greek foundations were were typically created by the Seleucids to solidify control over the trade routes within the region. [Zeugma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeugma_(Commagene)) and [Europos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura-Europos), for example were built to watch the crossings of the Euphrates. Originally the Seleucid capital was at Seleucia-on-the-Tigris in Mesopotamia, but as the Seleucids lost the eastern territories of their empire they also had to fortify the eastern and north-eastern borders.

There were of course many cities in the region before the Greeks showed up. Because the Hellenistic period in Syria lasted so long — from the origins of the Seleucid empire in the fourth century BC until the fall Roman Syria in the seventh century AD — almost any city with pretensions to culture and more than local importance put on the appearance of a Hellenistic city. The local populations were not replaced and Aramaic continued to be the language of daily life for most people, but many cities sprouted Hellenistic institutions: gymnasia, theaters, and temples in the Greek style. A good example of cities which were clearly non-Greek in origin and culture but which acquired a Greek veneer is[ Emesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homs) (modern Homs) which retained political independence well into the Roman era but whose royal family intermarried with the Roman elites, eventually finding their way into the Roman imperial throne.

This map of Roman Syria shows how many important centers picked up Greek names and a veneer of Greek culture during the long Hellenistic-Roman interlude. You’ll notice a mix of “real” Greek names like _Larisa_  or _Europos_  or _Zeugma_ with Greekified local names like _Emesa_ , from Hamat-zobah, along with a few Roman ones (those were typically Roman colonies, though they generally adopted Greek as the language of business and culture too).

Modern Damascus, incidentally, would have been _Demetrias_  to Greeks. However it was not always part of “Syria” in the Greek and Roman periods.
