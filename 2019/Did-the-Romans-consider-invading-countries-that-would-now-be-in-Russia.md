They briefly absorbed the [Bosporan Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosporan_Kingdom) in the Crimea. However they found it was more cost-effective to leave the Bosporans as an autonomous ally rather than a directly governed province. Romans were “in charge” of the region from about the time of Julius Caesar, but direct control only lasted from 66–68 or so. The Roman-Bosporan alliance, however, was very long lasting: the Bosporan kings remained Roman clients and allies until the kingdom was finally crushed by the Huns in the 340s.

Justinian reconquered parts of the old Bosporan kingdom in the 500’s. The southern shores of the Crimea remained part of the Byzantine empire until the very end — the [Empire of Trebizond ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Trebizond)and the [Principality of Theodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Theodoro) were the last statelets in the east with a direct inheritance from the old Roman empire; both were extinguished towards the end of the 1400’s.
