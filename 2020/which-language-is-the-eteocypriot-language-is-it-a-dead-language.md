It’s a language — or, quite possibly, a _family_ of languages — spoken in Cyprus from the Bronze Age though the early Hellenistic era.

Eteocypriot was first written in the [Cypro-Minoan script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypro-Minoan_syllabary), is a Cypriot adaptation of the [Linear A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_A) script of Crete. The oldest examples date to the middle Bronze Age, some time in the middle of the 16th century BC. After about the 10th century, Cypro-Minoan simplified into the [Cypriot syllabary](https://www.quora.com/When-did-the-Cypriot-syllabary-get-out-of-use-How-much-did-the-Greek-world-outside-Cyprus-know-about-it/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=c3fcc33d&srid=zLvM), a much simpler character set with just under 60 glyphs. That script continued in use until the early 2d century BC — it’s possible that Eteocypriot continued in daily use after that date but it leaves no archaeological traces after that.

We can read the syllabary because it was used to write Greek as well as Eteocypriot (and because we found a bilingual Phoenician-Greek inscription using the syllabary which helped us crack the code). However many of the syllabic inscriptions aren’t Greek. We call the language they encode “Eteocypriot” — the name means “True Cypriot” — but the only Eteocyprot words we can really understand are ones that happen to show up in bilingual inscriptions. Those allow us to see aspects of the vocabulary and grammar of the language, but items that show up without a Greek counterpart continue to elude us.

The Cypriot writing systems (first Cypro-Minoan and then the syllabary) were long-lived and fairly successful. We’ve found inscriptions using them outside of Cyprus, particularly in the Levant and Syria. Since we can’t really read the language, however, we can’t be sure if all inscriptions using the Cypriot writing are the same language or if there are multiple languages represented — given the 1200 year long history of Cypriot literacy it would not be surprising at all to find multiple languages.

Here’s a good, if complex, rundown of what we can guess about Eteocyrpiot: [Eteocypriot and Cypro-Minoan 1–3](https://www.academia.edu/26457464/Eteocypriot_and_Cypro-Minoan_1_3)
