Bufissimus is a good guess as an adjective, but I suspect plain old Bufo would be the Latinate way to do it -- at least for a certain kind of Roman. Those short, two syllable words ending in -o had a similar kind of cultural connotation in Latin to the old Anglo-saxon substratum in English. Some Romans avoided them because they sounded a bit too... rural; others embraced them as a sign of a good old-fashioned Italian identity. So if you were a proud and prosperous city magistrate from Picenum, like Gnaius Pompeius Strabo, you might embrace that as a sign of your old-fashioned country virtues.
