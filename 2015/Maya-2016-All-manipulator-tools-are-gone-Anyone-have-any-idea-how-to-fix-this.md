That looks like you may have (a) turned off gizmos or (b) shrunk them down too far.
Go to __Windows > Settings/Prefernces > Preferences > Display > Manipulators__ to check the size and visibility settings.

The bright green usually means 'missing material'. Try re-assigning a shader to your object.

If all else fails, back up your maya prefs folder and then delete it and restart maya.
