On the purely mechanical level, the cheap way to find a metaphor is find a phrase where you can insert a 'like' or 'as if' while retaining the sense. A simile is just a subset of metaphor which uses an explicit comparison. So: 



>  His was a _<like>_  vampire face, his foot was _<like>_  a lion’s foot, his hand was_<like>_  an eagle’s talon.


However, that's really mechanical stuff, it's operating at the level of a single phrase or sentence. A more interesting metaphor operates at a higher level:



> “It was I who cut down the cedar, I who leveled the forest, I who slew Humbaba and now see what has become of me...


could be read as a metaphor in which Enkidu's upcoming death is likened to those previous examples of destruction. Here you can't change the sentence but the comparison is clear.
