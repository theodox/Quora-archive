CS debuted at the [Half-Life MOD Expo](http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/07/30/half-life-modfest-tonight) when it was it had just begun its public beta. CS deserves credit for more or less inventing the concept of a 'public beta', and the fan community's investment in the game had a lot to do with the way they could see their feedback reflected in new releases. 

The public beta ran till I think September of 2000, through seven major releases (details here: [Counter-Strike Beta](http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/Counter-Strike_Beta)). Betas 6 and 7 still generate a lot of argument among the old timers as to which one was the _real_  Counterstrike. We started working on the 'shipping' version of CS --in the spring of 2000, mostly doing map polish, adding new models and weapons and overhauling the animation system to use blended animations. The Valve end of the CS team was composed mostly of the same people who had done Team Fortress (not yet re-dubbed "Classic") . The boxed version was finalized in October and on store shelves in November.

_Valve devs Dave Riller (L) and John Guthrie (R) provided the eyes, Photoshop did the rest._ 

 One thing I remember most is that I got my first internet death threat for fixing an old CS behavior: In early betas, hits with submachine guns put your player into an extended hit reaction animation with flailing arms. It looked great to the shooter -- but it didn't actually reflect what happened to the target, who could continue shooting accurately while he appeared to be waving his arms around at random. Besides open betas the CS community also pioneered the idea of threatening bodily harm to devs who fixed your favorite exploits (though I never figured out if the angry letters came from SMG fans who felt cheated, or from players who knew to headshot unsuspecting SMG fans during the dance of death).

Good piece of CS trivia: for a while around the holidays of 2000, CS was believed to be generating more internet traffic than _Italy._
