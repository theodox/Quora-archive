It’s probably a [synecdoche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche) — a part-for-whole swap.

Since poetry was probably the most prominent form of artistic endeavor for a lot of people in the Homeric era (between the fall of the Mycenaeans and the origins of writing, say 1400 - 800 BC) the association of ‘poetry’ and ‘creativity’ was probably pretty strong in a lot of people’s minds. You can easily see the effect in English where we might use ‘work’ or ‘creation’ for a director’s movie, an author’s novel, or a song-writer’s composition. In Greek philosophy _[poiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poiesis)_ _._ the act of creating or making, had powerful metaphysical overtones.

In old English and Norse you see the same underlying idea: a poet is a _[scop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scop)_ _(OE)_ or a _[skald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skald)_ _(ON):_ literally a ‘shaper’ or ‘maker’ derived from the verb _[scieppan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scieppan)_ __ or _[skapa](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skapa#Old_Norse)_ respectively, both of which mean _“_ to make, mold, or create”.
