The [Helvetii](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetii) whose name gives us the official name of Switzerland, the _Confoederatio_  _Helvetica_ , spoke a Celtic language. In what’s now eastern Switzerland there were also speakers of [Rhaetian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhaetian_language), a poorly understood language that scholars believe to be related to Etruscan, though by the imperial era the Rhaetic culture had picked up a strong Celtic overlay. In the north, Germanic groups were always active — even in Caesar’s day the [Suebi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suebi) were beginning to infiltrate the Rhine frontier area. Even though the Romans maintained a military barrier through the area after Caesars’ day, trade was still active across the border.

During the imperial period, Latin overlaid the existing Celtic and Rhaetic languages, at least in law, government and commerce. Modern [Romansh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romansh_language) is the direct descendant of the Latin patois of imperial-era Helvetia; it’s a derivative of Vulgar Latin with some vocabulary inherited from Celtic and Rhaetian. Once the region became governed primarily by German speaking representatives of the Holy Roman Empire Romansch began borrowing German words and habits.

Romansh gives a very useful window into the way Swiss terrain affects language: although it has only a few tens of thousands of speakers it has seven distinct dialects (and, of course Switzerland has three other official languages!).
