Ancient 'books' were usually multiple scroll affairs: a scroll is unwieldy so most works would be broken up into several smaller chunks (in modern editions, these are usually referred to as 'books': you see this frequently in citations of ancient works or the Bible. [Polybius XXXVIII](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/38*.html), for example, is the 38th scroll of Polybius's history (it covers, among other things, the Roman destruction of Corinth, a cultural tragedy at least as bad as the end of the Library). 

The Iliad, for example, is traditionally divided into 24 books for a total of about 120,000 words. Big blockbuster's like Livy's history of Rome could run over 150 books. So those huge scroll counts need to be divided by a pretty large number to get a list of 'books' in our sense. 

The numbers for the library are hazy (and the count fluctuated over time as well). However if you take that '500,000' scrolls and turn it into '15,000 books' it's on the same scale as the [Laurentian Library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurentian_Library) in Florence or [Thomas Jefferson's personal library](http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/jefflib.html). Marc Antony's gift of 200,000 scrolls stolen from the [Library of Pergamum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Pergamum) to Cleopatra to replace the books burned her civil war would be a reasonable 6,000 modern books: a single shipload, more or less, not a fleet's worth.

In the book-poor ancient world. 500,000 scrolls was really something, but it's less than 1 percent of the size of the Seattle Public Library.
