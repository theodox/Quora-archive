Perhaps unsurprisingly, [Constantine](https://www.ancient.eu/Constantine_I/). The move was less shocking than it might seem to us, temporary capitals were common during the rocky years of the late 3rd century. The most common eastern ones before Constantinople was [Nicomedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomedia), which is strategically similar though on the far side of the Hellespont .
