# Why didn't the Spartans take the Athenians into slavery after they were asked to? It was said that the Spartans refused. Why is this?

There’s not a lot of explicit source material explaining this decision: the Spartans did not leave any first-hand records of their own. The main source is the Athenian writer Xenophon, who says:

> …. the Corinthians and Thebans in particular, though many other Greeks agreed with them, opposed making a treaty with the Athenians and favoured destroying their city.

> The Lacedaemonians, however, said that they would not enslave a Greek city which had done great service amid the greatest perils that had befallen Greece, and they offered to make peace on these conditions: that the Athenians should destroy the long walls and the walls of Piraeus, surrender all their ships except twelve, allow their exiles to return, count the same people friends and enemies as the Lacedaemonians did, and follow the Lacedaemonians both by land and by sea wherever they should lead the way.

[Xenophon, Hellenica, 2.2.19–20](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0206%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D19)

Unsaid, here, is the fact that the Thebans and Corinthians both had reasons of their own for wanting Athens destroyed. The Thebans shared a border with Athens and were frequent rivals, fighting a regular series of border wars. The Corinthians were Athens’ main rivals in maritime trade. Both cities had reasons to want a competitor removed from the scene.

The Spartans, on the other hand, were thinking ahead to the post-war scene. They would be the the most powerful city and thus, in classic Greek fashion, the target of plots and combinations by all of the others. A grateful Athens, with an oligarchic government indebted to the Spartans for their position, would be a valuable ally whenever Thebes or Corinth did not want to follow Sparta’s lead.

As it turned out, the plan did not work — but the way it failed illustrates why it was a good idea. The Athenians overthrew the Spartan-installed government of the [The Thirty Tyrants](https://www.ancient.eu/The_Thirty_Tyrants/) very quickly, due less to anti-Spartan feeling than to greed and oppression on the part of the Athenian puppet government. The revolution was accomplished with support from Thebes, which didn’t want a close Spartan ally and a large Spartan garrison on its doorstep. A weak Athens at odds with Sparta was a better neighbor for the Thebans than an Athens firmly in the Spartan camp.

Those kinds of rivalries were persistent, but the pattern shifted constantly. Within a decade Sparta was fighting against Thebes and Corinth — _and Athens_ — in the [Corinthian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_War). The Spartan victory — paid for by Persia — led to a Spartan garrison in Thebes, which in turn was overthrown with support from Athens…. but within a decade Athens was allied with the Spartans against Thebes… in short, it was the eternal Greek game of ‘everyone against the leader.’
