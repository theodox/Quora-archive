For the most part in Avignon, France. The Popes had to close to Italy… but not too close, not too far from their French “protectors” so a location at the mouth of the Rhône was a great compromise. At the time the city was not actually part of the kingdom of France which provided a figleaf of independence.

The popular French wine known as C_hateauneuf du Pape_ takes it names from the castle — “the Pope’s new castle” — built for one of the Avignon popes. It’s about 8 miles from the center of Avignon. The Papal palace in Avignon is an interesting, if not particularly sublime, example of 14th century architecture

The popes of this period generally split their time between the palace in the city and the castle, largely depending on the political situation of the moment.
