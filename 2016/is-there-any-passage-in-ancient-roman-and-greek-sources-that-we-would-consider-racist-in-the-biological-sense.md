Here’s a great little gem from Aristotle:

> Those who live in a cold climate and in Europe are full of spirit, but wanting in intelligence and skill

I’m not being quite fair; this is actually part of larger discussion of the relationship between climate and national character; he goes on to say

> Whereas the natives of Asia are intelligent and inventive, but they are wanting in spirit, and therefore they are always in a state of subjection and slavery. The Hellenic race, which is situated between them, is likewise intermediate in character, being high-spirited and also intelligent. Hence it continues free, and is the best-governed of any nation, and, if it could be formed into one state, would be able to rule the world.

Mixed in the the Greek chauvinism is the idea that ‘hot climate’ peoples (Egyptians, Levantines, Persians) and ‘cold climate’ peoples (“Europeans” which for Aristotle probably means Celts, Thracians and perhaps Scythians) had distinct modes of life, which was pretty commonly accepted by the Greeks.

The work that Aristotle was probably riffing on, the [Airs, Waters and Places](http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/airwatpl.html) attributed to Hippocrates (he of the Hippocratic oath) is full of ascriptions that would get you in big trouble on any modern college campus, such as:

> Asia differs very much from Europe as to the nature of all things, both With regard to the productions of the earth and the inhabitants, for everything is produced much more beautiful and large in Asia; the country is milder, and the dispositions of the inhabitants also are more gentle and affectionate.

However this isn’t really a theory of ‘race’ so much as one about ecology: Greeks living in the mild climate of Asia are less warlike than other Greeks. And institutions matter too:

> As a strong proof of all this, such Greeks or barbarians in Asia as are not under a despotic form of government, but are independent, and enjoy the fruits of their own labors, are of all others the most warlike; for these encounter dangers on their own account, bear the prizes of their own valor, and in like manner endure the punishment of their own cowardice. And you will find the Asiatics differing from one another, for some are better and others more dastardly; of these differences, as I stated before, the changes of the seasons are the cause.

Still, Greeks and Romans definitely believed in ‘ethnic temperaments’: like most people in antiquity they didn’t share our reluctance to assign characteristics to groups (see [What are the cultural stereotypes from the various provinces of the Roman Empire?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-cultural-stereotypes-from-the-various-provinces-of-the-Roman-Empire)) However this wasn’t tightly connected to any particular theory of biological origins — at least, not one that was based on a systematic attempt at clustering people into “races”.

There was however a minor “science” which attempted to correlate character to external appearance. It was not a very PC endeavor, and might legitimately be seen as at least a stab in the direction of biological racism:

> _Too black a hue marks the coward, as witness Egyptians and Ethiopians, and so does also too white a complexion, as you may see from women. So the hue that makes for courage must be intermediate between these extremes. A tawny color indicates a bold spirit, as in lions : but too ruddy a hue marks a rogue, as in the case of the fox. A pale mottled hue signifies cowardice, for that is the color one turns in terror. The honey-pale are cold, and coldness means immobility, and an immobile body means slowness. A red hue indicates hastiness, for all parts of the body on being heated by movement turn red. A flaming skin, however, indicates mania, for it results from an overheated body, and extreme bodily heat is likely to mean mania._ 

( [Physiognomonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiognomonics), formerly attributed to Aristotle ~ 300 BC)

Although this does connect with ethnic stereotypes this bit is more closely related to Greek medicine, a Greek would point at a ‘ruddy’ Alexander or a ‘black’ Odysseus as examples of the physiognomic principles listed above.*

The ascription of cowardice to Egyptians was an old one for the Greeks (although in other context Egyptians were described as “wise” and “learned”). The usage above for Ethiopians is actually quite odd for Greeks, since the Ethiopians had a very high reputation among the Greek catalogue of stereotypes: usually they were described as pious, proud, and dignified:

> And [Greek historians] state that, by reason of their piety towards the deity, [Aethiopians] manifestly enjoy the favour of the gods, inasmuch as they have never experienced the rule of an invader from abroad; for from all time they have enjoyed a state of freedom and of peace one with another, and although many and powerful rulers have made war upon them, not one of these has succeeded in his undertaking. ([Diodorus_Siculus, III ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3A*.html))

Perhaps recognizing how poorly physiognomic generalizations held up in practice, Greeks also affected to believe that reason could overcome natural inclinations: Hippocrates didn’t actually behave like his own analysis of complex and humors would predict, but he explained

> This is indeed my character, and such is my disposition. But when I saw that these qualities were bad, I restrained myself from following them, and my reason overcame my passions.

When it came down to negative stereotypes, both Greek and Roman authors tended to direct their scorn north, rather than south. The Celts or Gauls were a numerous and frequently threatening presence; a Gaulish army sacked Rome in 390 BC, and another barreled through Greece in 270 BC before ending up in Asia Minor. Celts were noted for their size, red hair, and pale complexions - and also for their ‘instability of character’, violence, and drunkenness — Book V of the same Diodorus is a thorough takedown of the Celtic character.

TLDR: there are a few passages, particularly in the realm of quasi-medical or quasi-anthropological works that would definitely activate the modern race-o-meter. However there was no unifying concept of ‘race’ underlying those ascriptions: the Greeks happily accepted the idea that many of the hundreds of peoples they interacted with could be summed up in stereotypes but there was no orthodoxy about the causes: maybe it’s the climate? maybe it’s a predominance of humors? maybe it’s just “national character”? The idea of grouping the different ethnicities into a hierarchy or phylogenetic tree seems not to have come up except in vague mythological contexts (where, for example, the royal family of Argos were Egyptians and that of Thebes Phoenicians).



Aristotle’s [discussion of the ‘natural’ basis for slavery](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.1.one.html) is often cited in the context of Greek and race, but it makes no mention of what most of us think of when we heard the word ‘race’ — ie, skin color or facial features. You’ll frequently see this paraphrased as ‘Aristotle thought all barbarians are naturally slaves’, which is not entirely correct.

He does say this:

> …there must be a union of those who cannot exist without each other; namely, of male and female, that the race may continue (and this is a union which is formed, not of deliberate purpose, but because, in common with other animals and with plants, mankind have a natural desire to leave behind them an image of themselves), and of natural ruler and subject, that both may be preserved. For that which can foresee by the exercise of mind is by nature intended to be lord and master, and that which can with its body give effect to such foresight is a subject, and by nature a slave; hence master and slave have the same interest. …. among barbarians no distinction is made between women and slaves, because there is no natural ruler among them: they are a community of slaves, male and female. Wherefore the poets say,

> "It is meet that Hellenes should rule over barbarians; "

> as if they thought that the barbarian and the slave were by nature one.

Politics, I.2

This is unpleasant reading but it’s part of his preface: barbarians are ‘a community of slaves’ because they live an pre-political life as tribes and families: they are slaves because everyone lives at the whim of the head of the family and not under the laws of an ordered polity. The next couple of passages are all about the way society evolved from dispersed family units into civil associations:

> the most natural form of the village appears to be that of a colony from the family, composed of the children and grandchildren, who are said to be suckled 'with the same milk.' And this is the reason why Hellenic states were originally governed by kings; because the Hellenes were under royal rule before they came together, as the barbarians still are. Every family is ruled by the eldest, and therefore in the colonies of the family the kingly form of government prevailed because they were of the same blood. As Homer says:

> "Each one gives law to his children and to his wives. "

When he gets on to the subject of nature a couple of paragraphs later, he considers slavery in terms of individual nature. Here he clearly believes that some people are natural slaves and others naturally fit to rule:

> For that some should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule.

He goes on to try to show, in essence, that some people are too dumb to be free (using the tame animals and women as examples of “lesser beings” that benefit from the guidance of superiors (_I’m just explaining here, not defending!_ ) However he does recognize that his ‘ideal’ distinction of natural slaves and masters is not particularly close to the facts on the ground: a noble person can be enslaved as a prisoner of war without changing their nature; while a born aristocrat can be indolent and foolish.

> Hellenes do not like to call Hellenes slaves, but confine the term to barbarians. Yet, in using this language, they really mean the natural slave of whom we spoke at first; for it must be admitted that some are slaves everywhere, others nowhere…. What does this mean but that they distinguish freedom and slavery, noble and humble birth, by the two principles of good and evil? They think that as men and animals beget men and animals, so from good men a good man springs. But this is what nature, though she may intend it, cannot always accomplish.

Although in the earlier passage he’s being arrogant and sloppy by conflating ‘barbarian = living a pre-political lifestyle’ and ‘barbarian = not Greek’ (in other contexts, for example his discussion of the [constitution of Carthage](http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/AriCar.html), he clearly recognizes that non-Greek societies can have the same kinds of civic institutions he regards as necessary for ‘free’ life) — he doesn’t try to base his justification here on some kind of inherent quality in non-Greek ethnicity. It seems that he was actually bending the use of the word _barbarian_  away from its original meaning — which was simply “non-Greek” — towards its modern connotations of ‘primitive’; this seems to reflect discussions in the Athens of this time: Plato, around the same time, remarks that it’s [silly to lump everybody in the world but Greeks together](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0172%3Atext%3DStat.%3Asection%3D262d) despite their diverse languages, cultures and lifestyle.



*Coincidentally the four humors are black, white, red and yellow. However the Greeks had no idea of the existence of ‘red’ or ‘yellow’ people, at least not the way those terms are used in skin-color based racial discussions.
