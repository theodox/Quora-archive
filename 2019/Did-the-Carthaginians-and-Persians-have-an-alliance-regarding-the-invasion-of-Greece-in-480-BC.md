The idea of coordination between the Persians and the Carthaginians shows up in [Diodorus](https://www.livius.org/articles/battle/himera-480-bce/diodorus-on-himera/) — but not, significantly, in Herodotus who wrote several hundred years closer to the events in question. It’s most likely that Diodorus’s claim reflects his Sicilian background.

Not having contributed to the great epic of Greek history was a bit of a sore spot for the Sicilians. According to [Herodotus 7.160–163](http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh7160.htm) , Gelon — the tyrant of Himera and the most important Greek leader in the island — offered a large army to support the Greek war effort on the condition that he be granted supreme command of the Hellenic forces. This, however, was a post which neither the Spartans nor the Athenians would concede so his troops stayed in Sicily and he sat out the campaign. As extra insurance he event sent a shipload of treasure eastwards, intending to give submission to the Persians if they won.

Even early on this unheroic performance was a bit of a sore spot for Sicilians. Herodotus’ (7.165 ff) account gives a good idea of the slightly defensive tinge in the Sicilian attitude:

> The story which here follows is also reported by those who dwell in Sicily, namely that [...] Gelon would have come to the assistance of the Greeks, but that Terillus, the son of Crinippus and lord of Himera, having been driven out of Himera by Theron, the son of Aenesidemus and the ruler of Acragas, was just at this very time bringing in an army of Phoenicians, Libyans, Iberians, Ligurians, Elisycans, Sardinians and Corsicans, to the number of 300,000, with Hamilcar the son of Hanno, king of the Carthaginians as their commander, whom Terillus had persuaded partly by reason of his own guest-friendship, and especially by the zealous assistance of Anaxilaus the son of Cretines, who was despot of Rhegium, and who to help his father-in-law endeavored to bring in Hamilcar to Sicily, and had given him his sons as hostages; for Anaxilaus was married to the daughter of Terillus, whose name was Cydippe. Therefore, they say, Gelon was not able to come to the assistance of the Greeks, and sent money to Delphi.

> In addition to this they report also that, as it happened, Gelon and Theron were victorious over Hamilcar the Carthaginian on the very same day when the Greeks were victorious at Salamis over the Persian.

Unfortunately not enough survives of Diodorus’ book 10 to know what evidence he offered for a league between the Persians and the Carthaginians. It is however worth mentioning that if there really were such an alliance, it’s a bit peculiar that Gelon proposed sailing off to Greece to fight the Persians knowing that the Carthaginians intended to attack him in Sicily.

The inferiority complex in Diodorus’ (11.20–23) account of Gelon’s victory is most obvious in his conclusion:

> Because of this achievement many historians compare this battle with the one which the Greeks fought at Plataea and the stratagem of Gelon with the ingenious schemes of Themistocles, and the first place they assign, since such exceptional merit was shown by both men, some to the one and some to the other. And the reason is that, when the people of Greece on the one hand and those of Sicily on the other were struck with dismay before the conflict at the multitude of the barbarian armies, it was the prior victory of the Sicilian Greeks which gave courage to the people of Greece when they learned of Gelon's victory; and as for the men in both affairs who held the supreme command, we know that in the case of the Persians the king escaped with his life and many myriads together with him, whereas in the case of the Carthaginians not only did the general perish but also everyone who participated in the war was slain, and, as the saying is, not even a man to bear the news got back alive to Carthage.

> Furthermore, of the most distinguished of the leaders of the Greeks, Pausanias and Themistocles, the former was put to death by his fellow citizens because of his overweening greed of power and treason, and the latter was driven from every corner of Greece and fled for refuge to Xerxes, his bitterest enemy, on whose hospitality he lived to the end of his life; whereas Gelon after the battle received greater approbation every year at the hands of the Syracusans, grew old in the kingship, and died in the esteem of his people…

This is all a bit much. We don’t actually have any other ancient sources which compare the merits of Gelon and Themistocles like this. Diodorus backdates the battle of Himera to coincide with Thermopylae so that the Greeks could take courage from news of Gelon’s victory — Herodotus, writing within living memory of the battles, says that the battle coincided with Salamis (several weeks later) and makes no mention of the Greeks rejoicing at Gelon’s deeds.

Thus, the likeliest explanation is that Diodorus — a good Sicilian, from Agyra — is repeating a flattering local version of events that helped the Sicilians feel better about their sideline seat for the great national crisis. Turning two coincidentally timed events into a grand barbarian conspiracy converts a purely local triumph into a co-starring role for Sicily on the stage of world history.
