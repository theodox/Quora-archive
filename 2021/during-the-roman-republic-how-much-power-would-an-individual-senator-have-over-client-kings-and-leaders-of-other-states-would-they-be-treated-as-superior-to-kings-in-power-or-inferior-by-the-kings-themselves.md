# During The Roman Republic, how much power would an individual senator have over client kings and leaders of other states? Would they be treated as superior to kings in power, or inferior, by the kings themselves?

In the end, the military balance of power between the different parties had a lot to do with it. But if you want an example of how a Roman senator could treat a reigning king when the balance of power was tilted Rome’s way:

> When [king] Antiochus [of Syria] had advanced to attack Ptolemy in order to possess himself of Pelusium, he was met by the Roman commander Gaius Popilius Laenas. Upon the king greeting him from some distance, and holding out his right hand to him, Popilius answered by holding out the tablets which contained the decree of the Senate, and bade Antiochus read that first: not thinking it right, I suppose, to give the usual sign of friendship until he knew the mind of the recipient, whether he were to be regarded as a friend or foe.

> On the king, after reading the despatch, saying that he desired to consult with his friends on the situation, Popilius did a thing which was looked upon as exceedingly overbearing and insolent. Happening to have a vine stick in his hand, he drew a circle round Antiochus with it, and ordered him to give his answer to the letter before he stepped out of that circumference. The king was taken aback by this haughty proceeding. After a brief interval of embarrassed silence, he replied that he would do whatever the Romans demanded.

> Then Popilius and his colleagues shook him by the hand, and one and all greeted him with warmth. The contents of the despatch was an order to put an end to the war with Ptolemy at once. Accordingly a stated number of days was allowed him, within which he withdrew his army into Syria, in high dudgeon indeed, and groaning in spirit, but yielding to the necessities of the time.

[Polybius. 29.27](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D29%3Achapter%3D27)

This is, incidentally, the original of the familiar cliche _a line in the sand_ , although as you can see it’s really a circle.

The window where Roman senators interacted with foreign sovereigns without the spectre of Roman military superiority standing over their shoulders was pretty short. During that period, however, Romans abroad weren’t the only ones who could be high-handed. Just under a century before Popilius Laenas humiliated Anthiochus, two Roman senators went to complain to Teuta, queen of Illyria, about the depredations of Illyrian pirates in the Adriatic. The queen, unimpressed, claimed that she would certainly make sure that her own officers didn’t do anything to harm the Romans but that piracy was a local tradition and she wouldn’t interfere with her subjects’ livelihoods by forbidding it. The senators objected:

> "The Romans," he said, "O Teuta, have a most excellent custom of using the State for the punishment of private wrongs and the redress of private grievances: and we will endeavour, God willing, before long to compel you to improve the relations between the sovereign and the subject in Illyria."

The queen, unimpressed, had the offending Senator killed before his return to Rome; this triggered a series of wars which would end up with the Romans politically dominant in Illyria.

For most of the last two centuries of the Republic, Senators played an important role in maintaining the independence of the client kingdoms. Any smart client kingdom would have personal alliances with a number of influential Senators. The phrase “client king” derives from the traditional Roman practice of [clientela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage_in_ancient_Rome) , in which a powerful Roman would undertake to act as a guardian of the client’s interests in return for political support, favors, and sometimes monetary rewards (usually disguised as “gifts”). The client gained a voice, albeit an indirect one, in Roman politics and the Roman patron gained prestige and political influence.

These relations were often created, ironically, by conquest. Frequently it was a victorious Roman general who ended up as the protector of his defeated enemies once hostilities ended. These relationships were also inheritable: often a particular family would be the Roman champion of a foreign kingdom for several generations (the Cornelii Scipiones, for example had extensive clientele in Spain and North Africa dating back to the Punic Wars).

Generally the goal for both sides was a to create an illusion of amity (another word for the client relationship was _amicitia,_ “friendship”) but one which was firmly grounded in the reality of underlying power imbalances. Only in the very late republic, when strip-mining the provinces to finance political battles at home became increasingly common, did the underlying rapacity of the relation between powerful Roman and foreign client really become obvious. The theory was something like a super-sized version of traditional guest-friendships among aristocrats; the reality sometimes deteriorated into something out of a Mafia movie. As with the Mafia, keeping your voice down and speaking politely was seen as good style but it didn’t really change what was going on.
