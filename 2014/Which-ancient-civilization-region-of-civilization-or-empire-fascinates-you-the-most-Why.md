I'm very interested in the Cahokia Mound Builders: [Cahokia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahokia)
But the lack of written records makes it all very speculative.

The Khazars are an interesting bunch - In an era dominated by the conflict betwee Islam and Christianity, they converted to Judaism. Apple should have given them a _Think Different._  ad.

Hittites are poorly understood. A hundred years ago it was fashionable to cast them as the "Aryans" of the Near East. That sort of thing is decidedly un-hip these days, and I'd be very interested to see what new ways there are to understand them.
