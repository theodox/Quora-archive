# If, in 605 BC, the 26th dynasty of Egypt had been able to defeat the Babylonians and their allies and help the Assyrian Empire keep a rump state in Northern Mesopotamia, would the Assyrians have ended up a client state of Egypt?

In 605 the Assyrians were in a sorry state: their empire had just imploded and they were surrounded by enemies. Babylon, their traditional enemy, was in the ascendant — but the stage was being set for a real phase shift in the region: the rise of the Iranic-speaking empires, first the Medes and then the Persians, which would dominate the Near East until Alexander’s days.

This map shows Assyria firmly in the Babylonian sphere of interest — but consider the difference in scale between the Median Empire (in green) and Egypt (the time scale here is very approximate, but the map gives the correct impression). The Persians would succeed the Medes in 549 and the second Persian emperor, Cambyses, would go on to conquer Egypt in 525.

The 26th dynasty was not starting from a strong position, and their assistance was unlikely to be decisive in the Mesopotamian heartland

To the south the Kushite kingdom was a possible threat: the first pharoah of the 26th ([Psamtik I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psamtik_I)) only drove the Kushites out of Egypt in 656. As far as we know relations were fairly placid after that, but it would be surprising if either Egyptians or Kushites quickly forgot that [the Kushites had ruled Egypt as the 25th dynasty ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt)before the Assyrians came.

Assyria was also a long way off. An Assyria dependent on Egypt would have had to await aid from more than a thousand kilometers away, more than a month’s march for infantry. Along the way were both major river lines and a desert, the same terrain which would doom the legions of Marcus Crassus at Carrhae five centuries later. Babylon, meanwhile was only half as far off along a well-watered route. Historically, Egypt never succeeded in projecting power across the Euphrates with any regularity; even the greatest of Egyptian conquerors, [Thutmose III](https://www.ancient.eu/Thutmose_III/), never did more than raid the far side of the river.

In any case, none of the 26th dynasty pharaohs had the wealth or military might of Thutmose III. By this period native Egyptian military power was in terminal decline. The 26th dynasty was heavily reliant on Greek (and to a lesser degree Carian) mercenaries; Psamtik I created the Greek concession at [Naucratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naucratis) as a base for these soldiers. The mercenaries were critical to the defense of Egypt against foreign enemies, but also intervened decisively in internal conflicts like the war between [Apries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apries) and [Amasis II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasis_II). At least in the telling of Herodotus, the real nail in Egypt’s sarcophagus was the end of the alliance between Amasis II and [Polycrates of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycrates), who switched sides on the eve of the Persian invasion of 525.

So, it’s very unlikely that Egypt had the strategic resources to seriously exploit the chaos that accompanied the fall of Assyria and the rise of Babylon. The future, at this point, lay farther east in the Iranic-speaking lands of the Medes and Persians.
