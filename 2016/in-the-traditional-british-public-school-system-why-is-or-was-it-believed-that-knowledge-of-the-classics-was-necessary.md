# In the traditional British public school system, why is (or was) it believed that knowledge of "the classics" was necessary?

There’s really two different stories here, because this changed pretty radically over time.

Before the middle of the 19th century learning Latin, at least, was eminently _practical_ . If you planned on being a lawyer, a doctor, a scholar or a clergyman — in short, doing any of the respectable professions of a gentleman except perhaps a career in the military — you’d almost certainly have to deal with Latin material as a practical matter. Latin was the international language of scholarship and law — not knowing it in 18th century Europe was at least as much of a handicap as not knowing English in modern Europe. You could certainly get by — but you’d look like a bit of a bumpkin if you had no exposure. A

_“Introduction to the flowers of New Holland and Van Dieman’s Land, showing the characteristics of the plants collected and described by Robert Brown in the years 1802–1805” — An example of scientific publishing in Latin, which faded out only in the 19th century._ 

Greek was less widespread. It was a prestige language, but only practical if you wanted to be a scholar or a clergyman. In the 17th century (particularly during the intense theological debates surrounding the Reformation) Greek was topical; but in the 18th century it returned to being primarily a specialist’s concern. It did feature relatively prominently in the education of the English gentry, however, since such a large proportion of them were destined for the clergy where at least a little Greek was regarded as proof of seriousness (and of good Protestant credentials — no hiding behind a translation, even the King James).

By the middle of the 19th century, though, the practical need for Latin studies had declined.

As Europe got richer and also more democratic, there was enough scholarship and enough instruction in various national languages that Latin was no longer vital. The 19th century saw a rapid professionalization of higher education, with subjects like engineering, statistics, and modern languages gaining prominence for their practical utility. There was definitely a class connotation to that: going to Oxford to read Tacitus marked you as a gentleman; going to Manchester to study Chemistry suggested you were a ‘tradesman’. But it also established the foundations of the modern connection between higher education and social mobility: there would be good, well-paid work for a trained engineer even if he wasn’t going to be admitted to the finest clubs in London.

The older educational establishment (staffed, of course, by people whose professional credentials included being good at Latin and Greek) still believed that the study of ancient languages and literature was still “good for you” — that it taught critical reading, logic parsing, and the rhetorical skills you needed to be an effective leader. It exposed you to ‘high ideals’ and put you in the shoes of great statesmen where you’d learn how to move a crowd and to debate the future of your nation.

_By the 1840’s there was a market for books like_ ___The Comic Latin Grammar___ _trying to render the obligatory classical knowledge a bit less burdensome for schoolboys. The jokes however did not age very well._ 

In some ways, they were right: engaging in a tough subject which requires both serious detective skills, a lot of perseverance, and exposure to a very different set of ideas than you’d find at home are all good for you.

On the other hand so is learning how to play the piano. And, more importantly in 1800, so is learning calculus or chemistry.

So, over the course of the 19th century professional education — the training of scientists, engineers, and professional scholars — leaped ahead to match the rapid growth of the European economy. At the same time the modern university — with its specialized departments and professional focus — came into being alongside the remnants of the older traditions. The ‘gentleman’s education’ didn’t disappear, but it evolved more and more into a mark of social status and less a matter of practical importance.

At the same time social changes were also challenging the pre-eminence of Classics in the liberal arts as well. Modern languages (particularly German, in that century of explosive growth in Germany) and literature competed for the attention of literary-minded students; modern philosophies jostled for position as well. Romantic art and literature gained ground at the expense of the faux-classical styles of the 18th century. While the aura of prestige around the Classics remained high, the kind of halo that they had accumulated in the 17th and 18th centuries did rather dim as Europe became more conscious of having surpassed the ancients in all sorts of ways.

In short the situation in the 19th and early 20th centuries was actually very much like it is today: the “liberal arts” (literally, the arts appropriate to a _liberalis_ , a gentleman) were a mark of social distinction rather than an investment in one’s economic future. The main difference is that we now lump many of the “new” disciplines which competed with the Classics back then into the same basket of expensive ornaments (think of the connotations of the phrase “art history major”). Also, I suppose, the social cachet of both ancient and modern humanities is rather lower today than it was then: you don’t need to be a gentleman if you’ve got a Wharton MBA or a Stanford CS degree. Still, then and now people who love the subject matter believe that it’s valuable for its own sake and also for forming character; then as now skeptics see it as dilettantism.

It’ll be interesting to see how 21st century de-democratization of society will interact with this old divide: will the expensive liberal arts degree of 2050 be regarded as a huge waste of time and money, or as one of those invisible markers that distinguish the global elite from the proles? It’s a question which would have made sense to Juvenal, a grouchy, down-market member of the gentry who hated the way that wealthy parvenus without the graces were undermining the “classical” airs of AD 150:

_All wish to possess knowledge, but few, comparatively speaking, are willing to pay the price._ 

and

_It is not easy for men to rise whose qualities are thwarted by poverty._
