It looks like a slightly miscopied section of the [Elucidarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elucidarium), an 11th century theological handbook. It’s in a question-and-answer format — in this version the symbol indicating the answers looks like “RX”, probably for ‘respondit’.

It says

> quare permittit de[us] el[ecto]s sine fine peccare. (RX) Ut patefaciat divitias mi[sericordia]e su[a]e. Salvantur predestinati si non laborant. (RX) Predestinatio taliter...

Q. Why goes God permit the elect to sin ?

A. In order to disclose the richness of his mercy

Q Are the predestined to be saved if they do not work [for salvation]?

A. Predestination is such that….

In the [version I found online](https://books.google.com/books?id=I97UAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA198&lpg=PA198&dq=quare+permittit+deus+electos+sine+fine+peccare&source=bl&ots=-QldvnsTyS&sig=NXsx8vmOvjkCQYNX46o4poEZ6E0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjF-pyf59PWAhVCxVQKHb7ZBeMQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false) the first answer added _in eis,_ “to them”, It also looks like the copyist has interpolated the two words _sine fine_ , “without limit” from the preceding question by accident — at least in the version I could find the preceding question ends

_diligunt et volunt sine fine vivere ut possint sine fine peccare._ 

The mismatch between the heavy duty subject matter and the illustrations is a bit surprising to us, but was pretty common in the middle ages. The errors in the text suggest that the copyist might have been bored, which might help explain the doodle.
