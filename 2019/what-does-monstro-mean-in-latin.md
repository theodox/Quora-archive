“I show” is a pretty good translation, but it covers a range of ideas concerned with bringing something to someone else’s attention, from pointing at it to telling about it. That’s how it gets into English words like “demonstrate” (I show you how something works) or “remonstrate” (I point out your errors to you).

Our “monster” comes from the noun form _monstrum_ , “something shown” or “something made manifest.” Romans regarded unusual things like birth defects as omens, the gods “showing” some future event in an obscure form.
