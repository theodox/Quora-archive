Not in familiar Latino-English.

_Per consuetudinem_ “according to custom” or “following the form” is not uncommon legal Latin, but it does not seem to have managed to make it into the same league as familiar Latinisms like _mens rea_  or _quid pro quo._ Its not unheard of in English legal contexts into the early 19th century, but I’ve never seen it dropped into, say, an old-fashioned academic paper. In older English common law you could also encounter _consuetudo pro lege servatur, “_ custom acts as a law” as a way of saying that widely observed precedents have some kind of force.

_More suo, “_ according to his/her/its manner” is similar in intent but doesn’t have the connotation of any kind of formal precedent. At the other extreme _stare decisis “_ let that which has been decided stand” is a legalism for “follow the existing precedent.”
