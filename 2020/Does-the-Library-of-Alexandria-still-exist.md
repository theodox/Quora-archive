No. The first incarnation of the library was [destroyed in fighting between Julius Caesar different Alexandrian factors in 47 BC](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Julius-Caesar-burn-down-the-library-of-Alexandria/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=0f72f940&srid=zLvM). Some kind of book collection was restarted by Marc Antony, who stole the library of Pergamon and gave it to Cleopatra — but writers only in the next generation don’t mention any single outstanding collection afterwards.
