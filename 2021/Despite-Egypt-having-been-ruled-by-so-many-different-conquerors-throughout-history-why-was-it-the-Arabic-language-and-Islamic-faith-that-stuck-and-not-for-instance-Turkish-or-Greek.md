# Despite Egypt having been ruled by so many different conquerors throughout history, why was it the Arabic language and Islamic faith that stuck and not, for instance, Turkish or Greek?

More than anything else, Arabic has had a _lot_ longer run: it’s been the language of law, religion, and trans-national commerce in Egypt for almost 1,400 years. Greek had a respectably long run in the same role, roughly a thousand years; if question were written in the sixteenth century the “competitive stats” would look somewhat closer. The adoption of Greek letter forms and some elements of Greek vocabulary into Coptic reflects how widespread Greek-Coptic exchanges were during the Roman period.

However, there are a couple of key points of difference that suggest why things turned out as they did, and why Arabic was more integral to Egypt at the end of its first millennium than Greek was.

With the end of the (East-)Roman empire in Egypt most of the practical uses for Greek literacy dried up. Native Greek-speaking communities survived in Alexandria and the other large cities for centuries after the Arab conquest — but these were minority enclaves. To the native Egyptian majority, the utility of learning Greek after 646 was very low: if you ended up in court, or wanted to haggle with a merchant from a neighboring, country you’d be confronted by Arabic even if you spoke Coptic at home. Just as Latin gradually supplanted the native languages of Gaul and Hispania by facilitating commerce and social mobility, Arabic fluency was an important asset to an Egyptian regardless of creed.

In fact, we can see the Coptic Church beginning to use Arabic for practical purposes as early as the 10th century, at at time when Coptic was still the majority language among Egyptians and Coptic Christians were still the majority denomination.

The slide from Coptic to Arabic, however, also reflects [the break with ancient Egyptian which occurred in the Roman period. ](https://www.quora.com/When-did-the-Egyptians-lose-knowledge-of-their-writing-system/answer/Steve-Theodore)A literate Copt could only read Coptic literature from about the second or third century of our era or later — and the majority of Coptic writing was explicitly Christian.* So a Coptic convert to Islam would have little incentive to keep the Coptic literary tradition alive — unlike, say, an Arabized Persian who could still venerate secular Persian poetry alongside his Arabic Islamic culture.

The religious dynamic also reflects one key advantage for Arabic: as the language of the Qur’an it occupies a special place in Islamic religious sensibilities that did not have a counterpart in the Christian world. Roman imperial Christianity was always multilingual: Latins, Greeks, Copts, Syrians, Armenians and Goths all had liturgies in their own languages from very early on. While the Quran has been translated into many languages, oral recitation _in Arabic_ has always been seen as vital in Islam: Qur’an literally translates as _recitation._ A Copt in fifth century Egypt could adopt Christianity without feeling the need to learn Greek — a Coptic convert in ninth century Egypt, on the other hand, would have a much stronger incentive to want to learn the language of the Prophet. This was a thumb on the historical scales, so to speak, which Greek (and before Greek, Aramaic) didn’t have in Egypt.

Finally, the close strong equation of “Coptic” and “Christian” became a liability at the time of the Crusades: the steepest decline in Coptic language usage coincides pretty closely with the period of military conflict. The wars added a dangerous political undertone for the Egyptian who wanted to speak publicly in what was, by that time, an exclusively “Christian” language. A somewhat similar dynamic can be seen today in the threats to the various Aramaic language communities in Mesopotamia and Syria: fear of standing out can quickly undermine a language community, particularly if it extends over more than a generation.

As for Turkish: although Egypt was under Ottoman Turkish rule from 1517 to 1867, for much of that time the Ottoman hold on Egypt was exercised primarily through a complex web of deals with the local [Mamluk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk) aristocracy. The Ottomans didn’t have the kind of intrusive everyday presence that would have resulted in the forced Turkification of Egyptian daily life (it’s worth pointing out that in Syria, also under Ottoman control, Arabic did not retreat in the face of Turkish either). Arabic remained the language of the law, and commercial contacts between Egyptians and their neighbors were easily conducted in Arabic; thus there was little practical need for ordinary Egyptians to learn Turkish. Turkish didn’t become a primary administrative language in Egypt until the [reign of Muhammad Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt#Reinventing_Egypt), an Albanian (reigned 1805–1848). From then until the encroachments of French and English was less than a century.



* Spoken “Coptic” was the direct inheritor of late Demotic Egyptian. But the Coptic writing system had replaced all the older Egyptian scripts by the fifth century, rendering old texts and hieroglyphic inscriptions just as mysterious to Egyptians as they were to everyone else.
