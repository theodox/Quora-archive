Same as always: they muddled along. Cleopatra and Caesar spoke Greek together -- it was her native language and most educated Romans learned it as part of their educations. Like today most language learning was situational: if you're a Phoenician trader trying to sell things to Greeks, you pick up some Greek; if you're a Thracian slave toiling away for the Romans, you learn some Latin or you get beaten a lot. Many aristocrats would have 'guest friendships' - formal relationships with foreign cities and in particular with foreign leaders - and those relationships worked best when there was a common language. And of course most ancient armies had mercenaries or allied contingents who spoke different languages. Overall, Greeks and Romans were not particularly enthusiastic linguists but they were smart enough to know the value of communications. 

During most of antiquity one language or another became the common means of trade, much as English is today, or French was 200 years ago. In the ancient near east it was Aramaic, after Alexander it was Greek, and in the Roman west it was Latin. In all these cases the trade language ended up being simpler (and some thing less elegant) once lots of foreign speakers started using it: the _koine_ or "common" Greek of the New Testament is much simpler than the classical Greek of Sophocles and Thucydides; "Vulgar" Latin includes lots of constructs from Germanic languages, and so on. Modern Romance languages are the descendants of the pidgin-latin that evolved after the fall of the western empire.
