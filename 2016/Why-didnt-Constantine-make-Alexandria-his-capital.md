Alexandria’s importance declined after the Roman conquest of Egypt under Caesar. The city was still large and wealthy but it was not the kind of vital metropolis in the fourth century that it had been i the first; it was still the second largest city in the empire but growth was slow after it no longer monopolized the trade of half the Mediterranean.

Moreover, the city was hard to govern. The Greek population of the city had frequently clashed with their Roman rulers — while the city never mounted a full scale military challenge to Rome, low level dissidence was regarded as a proof of civic spirit. Caracalla, for example, [is said to have murdered many of the city’s Greek elite](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/herodian-s-roman-history/herodian-4.9/) because of their fondness for “witticisms about those in power” in 216. The city was far from purely Greek; it had large Egyptian and Jewish populations and all three communities were prone to settling their differences with riots (the Jewish community was basically wiped out in 115, though it had been rebuilt to a degree in Constantine’s time ).

Last, but most important, Alexandria was militarily insignificant.

The terrible problem that confronted all late Roman emperors was this: you needed powerful armies to keep an eye the frontiers — but you also needed to keep a close eye on your armies if you wished to remain emperor. Constantinople had excellent communications with the main military commands of the east, headquartered at Sirmium in modern Serbia, at Adrianople in Thrace, and at Antioch in Syria. Egypt was safe, but late Roman emperors were more worried about their own troops than barbarian hordes.

The colored dots indicate travel times… as you can see sea travel was much faster than land travel. Constantinople was ideally placed to handle news from the east or the Balkans
