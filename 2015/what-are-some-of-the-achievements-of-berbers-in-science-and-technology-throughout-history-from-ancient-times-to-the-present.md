[Juba II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II), king of Mauretania (50 BC - 25 AD) was a [Numidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numidia) Berber. He wrote several books in both Greek and Latin, primarily about natural history -- unfortunately none of them survive. He's credited with discovering the Canary Islands. He also categorized and name the [Euphorbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphorbia) family of medicinal plants.
