Ah! A history question that's actually got a short answer!

The Carolingians, like their Merovingian predecessors, did not believe in [Primogeniture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture) -- which is to say, when the King (or in this case, the Emperor) dies his inheritance is divided among his heirs, more or less equally. So the empire of Charlemagne passed to his son [Louis the Pious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_the_Pious) in one piece only because his siblings all died before Charlemagne. 

Louis, however, had 3 sons: [Lothair I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothair_I), [Louis the German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_the_German), and [Charles the Bald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_the_Bald). On his death the empire was divided among the three of them. They ended up fighting a civil war over the details but the settlement, known as the [Treaty of Verdun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Verdun) (843) reflected the basic Frankish principle of partible inheritance.

Charles got France, more or less: "West Francia", essentially everything west of the Rhône (note the _ô_ ). 

Louis got "East Francia", known to us as Germany: everything east of the Rhine and north of Italy. 

Lothair -- who was nominally the senior and who inherited the imperial title -- got the middle: the strip between the Rhine and the Rhone and Italy. This was in theory the prize, since it included both the imperial capital at Aachen and Rome. However it was an indefensible, culturally and linguistically heterogeneous mess which was unable to function as an effective state. It survives primarily as a map of Europe's most pernicious long-term strategic fault lines (see [Is the European Union sort of like the Holy Roman Empire?](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-European-Union-sort-of-like-the-Holy-Roman-Empire) ) 

 In theory the empire remained a single unit with a single emperor ruling through his subordinates -- but the reality on the ground was already a collection of warring successor states with different languages and cultures which would only drift farther apart over time.
