# What did the Romans get out of their African holdings? Who inhabited these areas, how did they relate to the empire and what were their contributions? Were these areas or people valuable for Rome in their own right?

Roman Africa was one of the jewels of the empire; in fact it was the loss of Africa to the Vandals in 435 that really marks the death knell of the western empire— the sack of Rome in 410 was far less damaging to the economy of the west.

The key value of Roman Africa was its agricultural productivity. It’s important to remember that “Roman Africa” didn’t really extend into the desert — the Romans wanted grain, not sand. The grain growing regions of what’s now coastal Tunisia and Algeria were (and still are) extremely productive, thanks both to geography and to centuries of investment in irrigation and other infrastructure. It was North African grain which formed the bulk of the massive subsidized dole at Rome — every year North Africa produced about 10,000,000 bushels of wheat for the Roman granaries. In the second and third centuries there was also an explosion in the cultivation of olives and grapes as well.

Carthage was the second city of the Latin speaking world and the fourth largest in the empire (after Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch). North Africa produced a lot of famous names: emperors (like the [Severan dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severan_dynasty)), authors (like [Terence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence) and [Apuleius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apuleius)), lawyers ([Fronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Cornelius_Fronto)) and even theologians ([Tertullian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian) and [St, Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo)). In fact, North Africans were envied for their good fortune:

> This region of Africa is altogether good, wealthy and fruitful, but the men living there are entirely unworthy to have it as their country

The ethnic backgrounds of North Africans were very mixed. Some were descended from the Carthaginian settlers — Augustine, for example, grew up speaking the language of Hannibal even though he’s one of the most famous of Latin writers. Many were descended from the Libyan and Berber peoples who lived in the region before the Carthaginians arrived. Others were the descendants of Roman soldiers who settled in the region. There was a lot of intermarriage — even before the Romans arrived the Carthaginian settlers had begun to marry into the local Berber peoples (Hannibal, for example, had a Numidian brother-in-law) and the Romans followed suit. Emperor Septimius Severus was Punic-Berber on his father’s side but his mother came from the Italian aristocracy. The modern population of the area has traces of all these groups, with the addition of the Arabs who came later.
