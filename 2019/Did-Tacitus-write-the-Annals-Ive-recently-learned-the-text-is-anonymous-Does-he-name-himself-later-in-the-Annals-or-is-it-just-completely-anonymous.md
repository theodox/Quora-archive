# Did Tacitus write the Annals? I've recently learned the text is anonymous. Does he name himself later in the Annals or is it just completely anonymous?

He doesn’t name himself in the text. The likeliest place for a self-identification would have been in a preface (like the [dedication](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/plinyepistle.html) at the beginning of Pliny’s _Historia Naturalis)_ but we don’t have one for the _Annales._ This might be because he died before completing the work.

However we do know that (at least after the 5th century) the circulating edition contained both the _Annales_  and the _Historiae_  in 30 books: we can see this in a reference by St. Jerome to “Cornelius Tacitus, who wrote the lives of the Caesars in 30 volumes from Augustus down to the death of Domitian” which would have included both the _Annales_  and _Historiae_ . At least some of the manuscripts we have now are clearly parts of that combined edition: the oldest (11th century) manuscript of what we call book 2 of the _Historiae_  actually ends

> _Cornelii Taciti liber octauus decim explicit_ 

that is, “Here ends book 18 of Cornelius Tacitus,” because the 16 books of the Annales were regarded as part of the same work. It seems to have circulated under the title of _Ab excessu Divi Augusti,_  “from the death of the deified Augustus.”

Both of the oldest manuscripts do explicitly attribute their contents to Tacitus, so we know that books 1–6 were attributed to Tacitus as early as about the year 850 and books 11–16 by the year 1000 or so.

_A page from the Plutei 68.2, which contains_ Annales_11–16 and the_ Historiae_. The red text indicates “here ends book 18 of Cornelius Tacitus; book 19 begins”_ 

[This page](http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/tacitus/) includes great roundup of the Tacitean manuscript tradition, along with a debunking of the peculiar “Tacitus is a forgery” meme which began with Voltaire and seems to crop again once or twice a century.
