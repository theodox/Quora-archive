Cicero, definitely not: he died in 43 BC.

As for Platonism, a lot depends on what you mean by “early”. Platonism and Christianity have a long and complicated inter-relationship which spans most of the last two thousand years, although Christianity emerged at a point when Platonism was in a period of obscurity. The most well known Platonist of the early Christian era was the Jewish Alexandrian philosopher [Philo](https://iep.utm.edu/philo/), who attempted to synthesize Judaism with a mix of contemporary Greek philosophical schools. Philo definitely thought of himself as a Platonist — but in many ways his “Platonism” was much more closely modelled on contemporary Stoic thinking.

A number of Christian thinkers adopted Philo’s effort to meld philosophy and revelation — notably [Origen](https://iep.utm.edu/origen-of-alexandria/) and [Eusebius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusebius) . There are some scholars who believe Philo influenced St. Paul, though this isn’t the majority view. In any case, however, Philo’s influence would not have much to do with Cappadocia: he and most of his inheritors were from Alexandria.

Platonism experienced a major rebound in the third century. This vigorous “[neo-Platonism](https://iep.utm.edu/neoplato/)” was the most important intellectual force in the later centuries of antiquity.

Here, there[ really is a Cappadocian connection:](http://n1.intelibility.com/ime/lyceum/?p=lemma&id=864&lang=2) the “Cappadocian Fathers” of the fourth and fifth century — Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzen, and Gregory of Nyssa — were all familiar with contemporary neo-Platonic thought. These three influential theologians helped to incorporate some aspects of the neo-Platonic world view into Christian theology. They were not merely borrowers of Platonist ideas — their chief religious opponents included both pagan neo-Platonists and Christians who adapted Platonic ideas for different reasons. Gregory of Nyssa summed up his attitude towards Greek philosophy as “acquiring the wealth of Egypt for the adornment of the Church.”

In any event, the Cappadocians’ reconfiguration of Platonic concerns and ideas set the ground for a long and fruitful co-evolution of neo-Platonic, Christian, and eventually Islamic ideas over the next millennium. There’s way too much material there to cover in a short answer, but there is an extensive literature about this relationship. You could start with this:
