Militant? Not really.

__The beginnings__ 

A flat earth was the consensus view in among the earliest Greek thinkers. If you read Homer with a very literal mindset, you’ll see that his world is more or less a flat disc surrounded by water, the “river” Okeanos.

However Homer was not particularly interested in retailing scientific knowledge; almost three millennia of efforts to read the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ as consistent depictions of a clearly envisioned physical model have never really produced a very coherent picture. The effort akin to reconstructing a Saturn V using Bowie’s _Space Oddity_  as a engineering textbook. That didn’t stop people from trying, however — a lot of Greek “natural philosophers” like to use bits and pieces of Homer to sell their pet theories, typically through tortured symbolic interpretations.

Nonetheless most of of the early natural philosophers also assumed a flat earth, probably based on ideas that migrated westward out of Mesopotamia. They disagreed with one another on a variety of topics, but that one was not particularly controversial in the 7th and 6th centuries BC. Here, for example, is a modern rendering of the cosmology proposed by [Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander#Cosmology) in the mid 6th century BC, with a cylindrical earth surrounded by the celestial bodies, mounted in rotating crystal rings.

We’re not entirely clear how the sphericality of the earth became the dominant view. The most common guess is that this really goes back to [Pythagoras ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras)at the end of the sixth century. However, spherophiles ought to take note: this was _not_ some kind of rationalistic leap. Most scholars believe it was the aesthetic and mystical appeal of the sphere — rather than some kind of deduction based on, say, the parallax of mountains — which drew Pythagoras towards a spherical earth theory. It was Aristotle, who coined one of the classic “common sense” explanations, citing [stars that are visible from Egypt but not from Greece. ](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.2.ii.html)It took another century, though, before the sphericality of the earth was established experimentally by [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes). He [conducted of antiquity’s few genuine scientific experiments, recording the length of the shadow on the summer solstice by measuring rods at two known points, clearly demonstrating that the earth’s surface was not planar](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200606/history.cfm).

__Common knowledge__ 

After the third century BC, more or less, the round earth was part of the common world view for anybody with a smattering of an education. The Roman naturalist Pliny (whose work would be the basic natural science text in Latin for more than a millennium) [didn’t feel the need to argue:](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D64)

> We always speak of the ball of the earth, and we admit it to be a globe bounded by the poles.

There were, of course, exceptions. Pliny [went on to say](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D65):

> On this point there is a great contest between the learned and the vulgar.

However, if the 21st century has taught us anything, it’s that you never know what’s “self-evident.” The most important flat-earther of Roman times was, ironically, none other than __[Lucretius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius)__ ____ — famous for his atomistic view of the universe and a hero to many modern rationalists. Here he ridicules the idea that the earth is a globe and there are people beneath our feet who think that we are beneath ours:

> And in these problems, shrink, my Memmius, far
From yielding faith to that notorious talk:
That all things inward to the centre press;
And thus the nature of the world stands firm
With never blows from outward, nor can be
Nowhere disparted- since all height and depth
Have always inward to the centre pressed
(If thou art ready to believe that aught
Itself can rest upon itself ); or that
The ponderous bodies which be under earth
Do all press upwards and do come to rest
Upon the earth, in some way upside down,
Like to those images of things we see
At present through the waters. They contend,
With like procedure, that all breathing things
Head downward roam about, and yet cannot
Tumble from earth to realms of sky below,
No more than these our bodies wing away
Spontaneously to vaults of sky above;
That, when those creatures look upon the sun,
We view the constellations of the night;
And that with us the seasons of the sky
They thus alternately divide, and thus
Do pass the night coequal to our days,
But a vain error has given these dreams to fools,
Which they've embraced with reasoning perverse

Lucretius was philosophically committed to the idea of an infinite universe — how better to render human life existentially insignificant? — so he didn’t want a universe with a single center: and for your average Greek or Roman the sphericity of the earth was precisely because the earth was the center of the cosmos.

Despite his modern fame, however, Lucretius and his fellow Epicureans, who were the main proponents of a flat earth in the Roman era, were never particularly influential in the realm of natural science; Pliny’s view would be the standard model all the way up until the Renaissance.

__A genuine crank__ 

A closer analogue to the modern flat-earther is the sixth century East Roman____ __[Cosmas Indicopleustes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmas_Indicopleustes)__ , who attacked the “false and heathen doctrine of a spherical earth” in his oddball _[Christian Topography](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cosmas_00_1_preface.htm)_ _._ 

Unlike most of his Christian contemporaries, Cosmas was a biblical literalist, though for a somewhat tortured value of “literal.” See if you can spot the flat earth hypothesis in his key text, [Paul’s letter to the Hebrews](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+9&version=NIV):

> Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary. 2 A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand and the table with its consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. 3 Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, 4 which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. 5 Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.

Cosmas was fixated on the word _earthly, κοσμικόν_ in the original. κοσμικόν is halfway to our “cosmic” but it can also mean simply “earthly” or “secular” — Cosmas however decided that here it meant “relating to the order of the universe”, and thus, that the tabernacle — the mobile sanctuary which Moses built for the Ark in the book of Exodus — was designed as a coded symbol for the universe as a whole. He regarded it as the authoritative biblical description of the physical world. Thus, argued for a rectangular flat earth under a semi-cylindrical heaven, shaped like the tent described in Exodus.

_Cosmas’ universe. Image:_ _[MyOldMaps.com](https://www.myoldmaps.com/early-medieval-monographs/202-cosmas-indicopleustes/)_ 

Living as he did in a world where pretty much everyone accepted a geocentric but spherical universe, with the heavenly bodies rotating around the center of the earth, Cosmas felt the need to explain what happens to the sun and the other heavenly bodies every night. The large mountain in the illustration above was his answer: at night the sun is eclipsed behind a vast mountain in the far northern reaches of the world; he claims in fact that the world slopes gradually from south to north to enhance the effect of the shadowing mountain.

Needless to say, this is a somewhat personal reading of scripture.*

Like a modern flat-earther, Cosmas is entirely familiar with the arguments of the other side. His [book 6, ](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cosmas_06_book6.htm#2)for example, is an odd inversion of the same argument that Eratosthenes used to derive the size of a spherical earth. He knows from personal experience that on the day of the summer solstice a man in Axum (Ethiopia) casts his shadow to the _south_ , while another in Alexandria on the same day casts his shadow to the _north._ He tries — unsuccessfully — to argue that the geometry implied by these two facts proves that conventional 6th-century science is wrong the intervening angles are to compressed to support Eraosthenes’ spherical earth. However his math is fudged because he assumes a small sun close to the earth, rather than a large one far away, one of his other deviations from the conventional views of his contemporaries. It’s a form of question-begging quasi-argumentation which is sadly familiar in many corners of the internet.

Cosmas is a strangely familiar figure in another way as well: he’s a perfect example of the crank who nevertheless seems to navigate life as a functional adult.

His cognomen _Indicopleustes_  means “the sailor to India.” In his career as a merchant he traveled as far as modern Kerala. His descriptions of the far-off lands he visited are sober and factual and still used by historians trying to understand the places he visited around the Indian Ocean and in Africa. However in later life he gave up his mercantile ways and became increasingly devout and also somewhat quarrelsome. He seems to have revised his _Christian Topography_ three times in answer to critics — of whom there were many, both Christian and pagan.

Cosmas seems to have displayed the true crank’s talent for alienation — he lived in Alexandria and yet seems to have adhered to the Nestorian tradition (which lives on today as the [Church of the East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_East)) — a stance which was highly stigmatized in that time and place. His primary spiritual influence seems to have been the patriarch [Aba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aba_I), born a Zoroastrian in Persia; unlike most Alexandrian Christians, the Nestorians tended towards a very literal reading of scriptures which would not be out of place in a modern fundamentalist church. Neither Cosmas nor Mar Aba were closely tied to the tradition of Greek literature, perhaps that helped them reject what was largely uncontroversial opinion.

It’s hard not to see echoes of many an internet theorist in Cosmas’ combination of boundless energy, defensiveness, and circular logic. His grammar is idiosyncratic and he tends to write long, repetitive sentences; thankfully he lived in a world without capital letters because one suspects he would have over-used them. Despite evidence of a poor education, though, he’s a tireless collector of quotes which might support his position, in Greek, Latin, Syriac and Armenian and he’s quite familiar with the key texts for the opposing side such as Aristotle in the way that a truly dedicated monomaniac tends to be. Like many an internet scribbler, he’s either a smart dumb person or a dumb smart person; he’s clearly ferociously self-educated but unable to step back from a pet conjecture.

__Status quo__ 

Cosmas fits the flat-earther profile in one more way: he was not widely taken seriously. There are only three manuscripts of Cosmas’ work (most of his writings are lost; the _Topography_ is the only survivor — this may have to do with its high-quality illustrations rather than its content) and it does not seem to have attracted much comment in the Middle Ages; when a copy was found in the Vatican library in the early 1600’s it had lain forgotten for probably 500 years. The standard textbooks of the Middle Ages all proceed from the models laid down by Aristotle and Pliny.

However, there’s an important distinction between different kinds of outliers — between holding honest, if idiosyncratic opinions on the one hand and simply pretending to hold them in order to irritate strangers. While Cosmas is a strangely familiar feature, it’s important to recognize that he’s an honest crank, and not a troll.

Face-to-face cultures don’t provide a lot of room for trolling, because they don’t provide the opportunity to pretend, pseudonymously, that you’re a crank when in fact you just enjoy watching people blow their stacks and don’t believe the a word of the stuff you’re spewing. The closest to that kind of behavior you find in antiquity is among the early Cynics: a philosophical school that embraced irritability and truculence, ostensibly as a way of skewering conventional ideas. Antiquity had slavery, ignorance, sexism, and absolutism — but at least it did not have 4-chan.



_* It’s likely that Cosmas took his inspiration from 4th-century bishop,_ _[Severian of Gabala](https://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/tag/severian-of-gabala/page/5/)_ _, who pitched a somewhat similar idea using different texts. Severian lost out in the theological-political struggles of his own day and his work was not widely influential afterwards. He was, however, connected with the same Syrian school of biblical exegesis that would later produce Cosmas’ hero, Mar Aba. It’s a bit perverse that this particular idea originated in a place which had deep roots in the long tradition of Chaldaean-Babylonian astronomy._
