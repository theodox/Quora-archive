The golden age of Athens is the fifty years between the defeat of the (second) [Persian invasion of Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Persian_invasion_of_Greece) in 480 BC and the start of the [Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War), which broke the Athenian empire, in 430. 

Athens enjoyed a good position for trade which was also a reasonably good defensive position. This made the city fairly secure and prosperous, but didn't provide a really critical advantage. The might Athenian fleet -- which stopped the Persians at [Salamis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis) in 480 -- wasn't built to defeat the Persians: it was constructed with an eye towards humbling Athens' perennial rival, the pesky island city of [Aegina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegina) (which had beaten the Athenians at sea in 507).

Three things conspired to catapult Athens into a leading position. 

The first was the __restoration of the Athenian democracy__ . From 561 BC to 510 BC Athens was under the thumb of the [Peisistratids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peisistratos) , who ran the city as a personal possession. Their ouster and the revival of the city's democratic institutions gave a huge boost to civic pride and created a much more assertive, self-confident state.

The second factor was accidental: the discovery of__a rich silver mine__  at [Laurium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurium) in 490 or thereabouts. The Athenian politician [Themistocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themistocles) convinced the city to spend the money on a powerful new fleet to take on the Aeginetans. In the event, however, the new fleet turned out to be part of something much bigger than a typical city-state squabble. 

The last and most important factor in Athens' rise was __Persia__ . 

The Athenians had supported the [Ionian Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Revolt) of 499, when the Greek cities of Asia Minor rebelled against their Persian masters. This began the [Greco-Persian Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars)., which would prove to be the foundation of Athenian power. 

The first Persian invasion of Greece was aimed only at punishing Athens, but the Athenians beat it off at [Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon) in 490: another boost to their prestige and pride. More importantly it set the stage for a second, immeasurably large invasion in 480: Herodotus claimed the Persian forces included 2.5 million warriors from as far away as India and Ethiopia, though modern historians put the number around 800,000). Much of Greece was cowed into immediate submission, and the defenders were a shaky coalition which constantly threatened to fall apart. The pillars of the defensive alliance were Sparta -- the traditional military 'superpower' of Greece -- and Athens, which knew it had no choice. 

The Persian juggernaut rolled through central Greece overpowering the tiny Spartan force sent to delay them at [Thermopylae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermopylae). Athens itself was taken and burned to the ground by the Persians, but most of the city's populace was evacuated. However the wily Themistocles lured the much larger Persian fleet into a trap at [Salamis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis) and smashed it, exposing the Persian flank and giving the shaken Greek defenders their first victory. The next year the Greeks defeated the Persian land army at [Plataea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plataea), ending the invasion.

The defeat of the invasion brought the Athenians a lot of martial prestige -- but it also exposed the unwillingness of the Spartans to venture far from their traditional strongholds in southern Greece. Athens, buoyed by its performance in this epic contest, was eager to pursue the fight. As the Spartans withdrew into isolationism the Athenians took over leadership of the anti-Persian alliance. By 477 the wartime alliance had officially become the [Delian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_League), devoted to liberating the Greek cities of Asia and the Aegean from the Persians.

Unofficially, though, the league had become the foundation of an Athenian empire.

The league did pursue the war against the Persians. As the war dragged on in into less dramatic raids and skirmishes, many cities tired of the fight and preferred to contribute money rather than soldiers. Within a decade or two these 'contributions' had morphed into mandatory tribute. The Athenians were as ruthless towards 'allies' who didn't want to pay the bills as they were towards the Persians. It was money from the Delian League treasury which built the Pathenon, and expanded the all-important Athenian fleet.

 _Your tax drachmae at work, people of Naxos!_ 

The combination of naval power, the tribute money coming in from the Delian League cities, and Athens' prestige as the bulwark of Greece against the barbarians made Athens the most powerful -- and most mistrusted -- city in Greece. It was that mistrust which eventually brought about the ruinous war against Sparta -- and the end of Athens' golden half-century -- in 430.
