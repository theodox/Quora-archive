The Hittites as a people drop out of the historical record around the time when the Persian empire arose. The Hittite empire — centered in modern Turkey — fell victim to the [Bronze Age Collapse](https://www.quora.com/What-caused-the-Bronze-Age-Collapse) around the beginning of the twelfth century BC.

Ethnic Hittite dynasties survived in small kingdoms scattered around modern Syria, Lebanon and Israel.

_Hittite successor states in Turkey and Syria_ 

The usual scholarly opinion is that the [Hethites](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Hittites) of the Bible are the descendants of the Bronze Age empire. The unfortunate victim in the biblical story of [David and Bathsheba](http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/bathsheba/a/021511-CW-Bathsheba.htm), for example, was the general [Uriah the Hittite/Hethite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriah_the_Hittite).

Assuming that the Hittite-> Hethite identification is correct, the last direct mention of them is probably in the book of [Esdras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esdras), in the time of the Persian emperor Artaxerxes, so mid-5th century BC. Presumably their descendants are merged into the modern populations of the Levant, Syria and Turkey.

As an aside, “Hittites” is not what they usually called themselves. It seems that their own name for themselves was more like Nešas : see [How did the Hittites call themselves?](https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Hittites-call-themselves) The term Hittites refers to the ‘Land of Hatti’, the capital region of the old Hittite empire.
