Generally Modo is more narrowly focused on modeling, and for that I think it's more economic and efficient than Blender.

However Blender is a more general purpose app with a wider range of features for animation (especially character animation) and specialty rendering.

Blender’s scripting API is also more flexible than Modo’s if you need to creat tools or extend the application.

Tldr: Modo is usually regarded as a better modeling package but Blender is more open ended
