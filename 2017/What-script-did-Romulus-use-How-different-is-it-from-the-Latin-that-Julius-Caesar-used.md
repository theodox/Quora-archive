This is the [oldest surviving fragment of written Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praeneste_fibula):

It’s a small cloak-pin with the inscription (reading from right to left)

MANIOS MED FHEFHAKED NVMASIOI

or “Manius made me for Numasius” in very old fashioned Latin.

For comparison, here’s a cryptic inscription known as the [Lapis Niger ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_Niger)or “Black Stone”.

In both cases the letter forms owe a lot to Greek — the Romans got their alphabet from the Greek cities of Campania (or, equally likely, the got it from the Etruscans who got it from the Greeks). The left-to-write writing style had yet to become dominant — like Greeks in the same period the early Roman writings sometimes go right to left and sometimes “boustrophedon” style where the lines alternate.

Both examples would still be late for Romulus. This Lapis niger appears to date from before the Republic (on line 5 above, you can see the word _recei_ , which is an archaic form of _rege_ , “to the king”) . Traditionally Romulus was succeeded[ by six more king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Kingdom)s before the foundation of the Republic, which is pretty well dated to 509 BC. If you go with the usual stories, which are pretty heavily mythologized, Romulus would have lived about 200 years before the latest possible date for this inscription. The fibula is harder to date, but is usually put in the middle of the 600’s BCE — still a century after Romulus.

Of course — being raised by a wolf and then growing up as a shepherd-cum-brigand — Romulus would not have been literate in any case.
