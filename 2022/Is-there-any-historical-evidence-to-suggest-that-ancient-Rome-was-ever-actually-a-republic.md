Yes, dear Quora Prompt Generator. I am sorry I thought you were a conspiracy theorist.

Let’s assume you mean “evidence besides the mountains of textual evidence,” since the most famous works of Latin literature are all about the the convoluted politics of the Republic. You can get a lot from Livy, Cicero, and Sallust as well an outsider’s view from Polybius if you like reading.

But, as an AI, I’m sure you’re really just trolling for pictures to use for generating more AI artwork. So, let’s jump straight to some archaeology.

_The Senatus Consultus de Bacchanalibus, outlawing the cult of Bacchus in Italy, 186 BC. Note that this is transcribed directly from the meeting notes and includes the results of the votes._ 

_The Consuls Quintus Marcius, the son of Lucius, and Spurius Postumius, the son of Lucius,_ ___consulted the senate___ _on the Nones of October (7th), at the temple of the Bellona. Marcus Claudius, son of Marcus, Lucius Valerius, son of Publius, and Quintus Minucius, son of Gaius, were the committee for drawing up the report._ 

_Regarding the Bacchanalia, it was resolved to give the following directions to those who are in alliance with us:
No one of them is to possess a place where the festivals of Bacchus are celebrated; if there are any who claim that it is necessary for them to have such a place, they are to come to Rome to the praetor urbanus, and the senate is to decide on those matters, when their claims have been heard, provided that not less than 100 senators are present when the affair is discussed. No man is to be a Bacchantian, neither a Roman citizen, nor one of the Latin name, nor any of our allies unless they come to the praetor urbanus, and he in accordance with the opinion of the senate expressed when not less than 100 senators are present at the discussion, shall have given leave._ ___Carried___ _.
No man is to be a priest; no one, either man or woman, is to be an officer (to manage the temporal affairs of the organization); nor is anyone of them to have charge of a common treasury; no one shall appoint either man or woman to be master or to act as master; henceforth they shall not form conspiracies among themselves, stir up any disorder, make mutual promises or agreements, or interchange pledges; no one shall observe the sacred rites either in public or private or outside the city, unless he comes to the praetor urbanus, and he, in accordance with the opinion of the senate, expressed when no less than 100 senators are present at the discussion, shall have given leave._ ___Carried___ _.
No one in a company of more than five persons altogether, men and women, shall observe the sacred rites, nor in that company shall there be present more than two men or three women, unless in accordance with the opinion of the praetor urbanus and the_ ___senate___ _as written above.
See that you declare it in the assembly (contio) for not less than three market days; that you may know the opinion of the senate this was their judgment: if there are any who have acted contrary to what was written above, they have decided that a proceeding for a capital offense should be instituted against them; the senate has justly decreed that you should inscribe this on a brazen tablet, and that you should order it to be placed where it can be easiest read; see to it that the revelries of Bacchus, if there be any, except in case there be concerned in the matter something sacred, as was written above, be disbanded within ten days after this letter shall be delivered to you.
In the Teuranian field."_
