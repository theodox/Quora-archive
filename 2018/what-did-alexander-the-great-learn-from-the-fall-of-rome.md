If by ‘fall of Rome’ you mean the Germanic invasions of the 5th century, it has to be _time travel_  — that’s eight or nine centuries into the future for Alexander.

In Alexander’s lifetime, Rome was still an middling-ranked city state on the fringes of the Mediterranean great-power system. It was not completely unknown to Greeks, since southern Italy had been studded with Greek cities — some on friendly terms with Rome, others not — for several hundred years. However the future course of Roman power was not particularly clear during Alexander’s lifetime; the first Greek to appreciate that Rome was a power to be reckoned with was [Timaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(historian)), who wrote a generation or so after Alexander’s death.

Alexander’s younger cousin [Pyrrhus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus)would be the first mainland Greek to encounter the Romans on the battlefield. His army, modeled on Alexander’s (including elephants imported from India), beat the Romans at [Heraclea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Heraclea) in 280 BC and again, narrowly, at [Asculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Asculum) in 279. Alexander’s friend and court historian, [Hieronymus of Cardia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_of_Cardia), wrote the history of those battles, providing a living link between Alexander and Rome. However, Alexander had been dead for more than 40 years when Pyrrhus invaded Italy — Hieronymus famously lived to a fantastic old age.

It’s not unlikely that somebody in Alexander’s circle had heard of the other f[all of Rome — to the Gauls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Allia) in 390 BC, which happened in his grandfather’s day. Alexander is said to have met with a Gallic delegation in the Balkans while campaigning along the Danube as a young man; but he Gauls were still an under-appreciated enemy in Alexander’s lifetime, mostly an ethnographic curiosity. Around the same time that Pyrrhus was learning to respect the Romans, however, a [massive Gallic invasion rolled into Greece and Asia Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_settlement_of_Eastern_Europe#Great_expedition_of_279_BC), disrupting many of the kingdoms of Alexander’s fractious successors.

_The famous statue of the Dying Gaul commemorates a battle against the Gauls in the invasion of 279 BC. The Gauls who conquered Rome in 390 BC were distantly related to the invaders who fought Alexander’s successors._ 

Gallic mercenaries would become a critical part of the Hellenistic world for some centuries to come. A settlement of Gallic warriors in [Galatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatia) would produce a local culture of pants-wearing, hard-drinking, red-headed Celts in the heart of Alexander’s old empire. Their descendants would still be speaking a Celtic language in the streets of Ankara, seven centuries later when the western Roman empire fell apart.
