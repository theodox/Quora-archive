The lup- comes from _lupus,_ the Latin for wolf. But the -aster is a suffix meaning “imitation” or “lesser” — the most common use is for words like “poetaster”, a false or amateur poet. So it sounds like the Linnaean name means roughly “imitation-wolf dog” as opposed to _canis lupus lupus._ A lot of Linnaean names repeat the main name for the “original” animal, such as _rattus rattus,_ the black (“common”) rat.
