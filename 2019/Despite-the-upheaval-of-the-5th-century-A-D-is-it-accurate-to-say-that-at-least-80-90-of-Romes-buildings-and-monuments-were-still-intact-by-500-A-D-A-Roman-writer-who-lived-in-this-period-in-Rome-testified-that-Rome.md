# Despite the upheaval of the 5th century A.D., is it accurate to say that at least 80%-90% of Rome's buildings and monuments were still intact by 500 A.D.? A Roman writer who lived in this period in Rome testified that Rome still looked "splendid".

The sources don’t really allow us to quantify the situation. The first major damage to the fabric of the city (apart from an earthquake around 400, which damaged the Colosseum and may have toppled the Collossus of Nero) was really from the __[Vandal sack of Rome in 455](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(455))__ .

The __[Gothic sack in 410](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging)__  gets all the press, because it was the first one in eight centuries — at least, not counting various things Romans had done to each other in the intervening years. The Goths were (comparatively) restrained: they concentrated on movable wealth (gold, silver, and slaves) but they spared the city’s churches and most of it’s buildings. The Gothic sack lasted three days. The Vandals, however, did their work in fourteen. They lived up to their reputation as wreckers, in particular by cutting several of the city’s aqueducts. In addition to movable properties, the Vandals stripped the buildings themselves — notably the gilded roof tiles of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus — along with statues that the more mobile Goths had left behind. Above all they took many shiploads of slaves.

Outside of the drama, the Vandal sack also marks the end of Rome’s ability to sustain its outsized population. The city could only be sustained by massive importation of grain, primarily from North Africa. The same Vandals who stole the roof tiles from the temple of Jupiter did far more damage by conquering the grain-lands of Tunisia and Algeria in 435.

_A highly imaginative reconstruction of the Vandal sack by Karl Briullov. The prominent dark-skinned fellows are, presumably, a 19th century Russian nod to the fact that the Vandals ruled Roman North Africa. The bishop at right is Pope Leo who tried to intercede with Genseric on behalf of the civilian population._ 

The loss of the gold, silver and statues was a blow to Rome’s prestige — the loss of the aqueducts and the irreplaceable North African grain sent the city into a tailspin from which it never recovered.

The chaotic years from 455–476 will not have helped much. Stability of a sort was finally imposed by [Odoacer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer), who was a conscientious administrator and worked fairly well with the Roman senate despite his Barbarian origins. It’s also worth pointing out that there was a mini-building boom , at least for churches, in first half of the century: an example would be the church of Santa Sabina, which is still impressive.

Overall, it’s hard to put a real estimate on percentages — many Roman buildings were extremely hardy, as you can see from their ruins today, but others were unlikely to survive a few decades of neglect. Our information tends to be skewed towards the big monuments which are outliers by definition.
