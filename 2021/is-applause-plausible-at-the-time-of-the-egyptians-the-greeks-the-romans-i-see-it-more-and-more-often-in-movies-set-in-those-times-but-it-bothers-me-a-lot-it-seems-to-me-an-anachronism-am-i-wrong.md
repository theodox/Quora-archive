# Is applause plausible at the time of the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans? I see it more and more often in movies set in those times, but it bothers me a lot, it seems to me an anachronism. Am I wrong?

Applause was a pretty big deal in antiquity, at least in Greco-Roman antiquity.

In a face-to-face society where entertainment was generally conducted outdoors the alternative was quite literal crickets. It was also, famously, a chance for the public to make its feelings known anonymously; Athenian democrats and Roman emperors were always keenly attuned to the lines which garnered popular applause: theatrical responses were widely understood to be the closest thing to public opinion polls in antiquity. [As Cicero said](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0020%3Atext%3DSest.%3Asection%3D106):

> In truth, there are three places in which the opinion and inclination of the Roman people may be ascertained in the greatest degree; the assembly, the comitia, and the meetings at the games and at exhibitions of gladiators.

Most Roman plays ended _valete et plaudite! “be well — and clap!” ._ Emperor Augustus’s last words are usually quoted as _acta est fabula_ , “the play is over” — but [Suetonius quotes him at greater length (in Greek):](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#99)

> Ἐπεὶ δὲ πάνυ καλῶς πέπαισται, δότε κρότον
Καὶ πάντες ἡμᾶς μετὰ χαρᾶς προπέμψατε.

> Since well I've played my part, all clap your hands
And from the stage dismiss me with applause

All of this meant that the act of applauding was also quite well studied. By the Roman era it was pretty common for insecure performers (most famously, the narcissistic emperor Nero) to pack the stands with paid claques to make a lot of noise and try to get the crowd worked up — [the ancient version of a laugh track or an applause sign.](https://www.quora.com/If-there-were-a-Latin-or-Greek-name-to-describe-an-intense-dislike-for-the-sound-of-canned-laughter-from-the-TV-what-would-it-be)

The practice is best known from the Roman evidence, but it originated with the Greeks: since Greek plays were usually debuted in competitive festival settings, with fame and money riding on the outcome, it made sense to try to pack the audience if you could: it was widely claimed that [Philemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philemon_(poet)) repeatedly defeated [Menander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menander) in the Athenian festivals because of his organized supporters (Menander reportedly asked him, “don’t you blush when you beat me?”). By the Roman period, Alexandria had the most professional claques; when Nero needed to pack the stands, he hired Alexandrians to train his soldiers the right way to applaud.

The students of applause recognized different kinds of paid applauders. Among the clappers were the “roof tiles” who clapped with cupped hands, like the rounded terracotta tiles of a Mediterranean roof* and the “bricks” who clapped with flat hands. A third type, the “bees” specialized in vocal approbation. Collectively these were known as _laudiceni —_ a triple pun meaning “speakers of praise” in Greek, “those who praise in return for dinner” in Latin, and a reference to the wealthy city of Laodicea in Asia Minor.

A more dignified way to express approval was to snap you fingers. More enthusiastic crowds might twirl the hems of their togas or leap to their feet (“exult” in English comes from Latin “[exsulto](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=exsulto),” literally “jump up” but really “jumping for joy”_)._ Later emperors, mindful of the sometimes explosive potential of popular expressions of emotion in theaters and amphitheaters, encouraged the more decorous waving of handkerchiefs as an alternative. They were right to be nervous: eventually rowdy sports fans in Constantinople ignited the [Nika Riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nika_riots), which nearly destroyed the city and left tens of thousands dead.



* The standard etymology for “clap” is from Old English _claeppan_  , but one notes that the rounded runnels in Greek and Roman tile roofs were called _kalypteres._ 

** The cloth-waving continued on into early Christian churches.
