It’s grammatically required:

“preserved here are the bones __of Thomas Hobbes__  of Malmsbury, who for many years served the two counts of Devon, father and son. An honest man, well known at home and abroad for the fame of (his) erudition. He died in the year of the Lord 1679, in the month of December, on the fourth day. His age (was) 91.”

In the opening sentence the subject is __ossa,__ “bones”, and Thomae is “of Thomas” in the genitive case. The translator — reputedly Hobbes himself — opted not to Latinize “Hobbes”.
