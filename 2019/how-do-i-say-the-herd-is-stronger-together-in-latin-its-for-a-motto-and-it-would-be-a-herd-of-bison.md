# How do I say "The herd is stronger together" in Latin? It's for a motto and it would be a herd of bison.

I’d try something like

_congregantia se corroborant armenta_ 

_armenta_  is a herd, particularly of draught-like animals like oxen. _congregantia_ is “coming together” and the root word “grego” is specific to a flock or a herd — this is where we get _congregation_  and related words in English. _se corroborant_  is “makes itself stronger.” You could use any word order here, though _se_  should probably always precede _corroborant._ 

Technically, _armenta_  is a plural, so it’s really “the large quadrupeds, herding or flocking together, make themselves stronger” It’s a bit less clunky in Latin.
