According to [the Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World](http://orbis.stanford.edu/) the trip would take about 30 days under good conditions. As always in ancient times sea travel was generally faster than land travel, so the route would probably take you by sea from London to Burdigala (Bordeaux), by land to Narbo (Narbonne), and then by sea again to Italy.

The link above is great for guesstimating alternate routes and conditions (time of year matters a great deal)
