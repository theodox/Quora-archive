In Europe it would have been __Athens__ . We don’t have great demographic data, alas, but the usual estimate for all of Attica (a bit smaller than the modern department of Greece by the same name) is around 300,000. However the _astu,_ the actual urban core that we’d call a “city” was less than 100,000 and probably closer to 60,000; most “Athenians” lived in rural communities in the Attic countryside.

The second place goes to __Syracuse__  which was on a slightly smaller scale perhaps 250,000 total. Here again there’s a similar proportion of rural to urban residents, probably in the realm of 45,000.

There’s a chance — impossible to quantify, alas — that Syracuse had actually surpassed Athens by Alexander’s time. Athens had taken a significant demographic hit at the end of the fifth century; the plague of Pericles, defeat in the Peloponnessian war after a generation of sieges, and most importantly loss of the overseas empire that provided vital food imports all took some kind of toll. In general the population of the old Aegean centers was not growing as fast as other parts of the Greek world by around Alexander’s time: it’s significant that the great urban centers of the coming Hellenistic era (Alexandria, Seleucia, and Antioch to name the most obvious) were all overseas. Ancient cities tended to cap out at a fairly small size unless supported by the proceeds of empire.

__Rome__  had not yet achieved its eventual monstrous size, but it was growing and offers a solid contender for third place. Roman tradition offered conflicting numbers for the census of 323 BC, the year of Alexander’s death, ranging from 130,000 to 250,000. Modern historians tend to regard those counts as too high if you read the number _adult male citizens,_  but if it means as _inhabitants_  that puts us in the same rough league as Athens and Syracuse, perhaps 200,000 people with a core of 40,000.*

You’ll notice of course that all the language here is very provisional. We don’t have the kind of data that would let us be more definite. One thing that’s pretty clear, however, is that all of these cities were pretty small compared to __Babylon,__ the largest city in the world at the time. Babylon is usually said to have had 200,000 people in its urban core in this period.

This paper great summary of the interesting technical arguments about how to establish these numbers (and the rather broad error bars around them): [https://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/morris/120509.pdf](https://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/morris/120509.pdf)



* If you did take the Roman tally literally, the population probably goes up by 2.5 times and Rome suddenly outpaces Athens and Syracuse. This is one of the many reasons modern historians [can’t reach consensus on these numbers](http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/scheidel/070706.pdf).
