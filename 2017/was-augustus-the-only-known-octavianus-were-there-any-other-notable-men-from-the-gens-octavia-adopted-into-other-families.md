Technically Augustus was an _Octavius:_ the “-ianus” suffix would be the conventional way to identify somebody born an Octavius but adopted into another family — you can see the same thing in the same way that Publius Aemilius Paullus became Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus when adopted by Scipio. Octavian is a modern coinage: pretty much from the get-go, the future Augustus dropped the conventional Octavianus and insisted on being addressed as _Gaius Julius Caesar_  without it — an unusual, but politically astute move.

The gens Octavia was an old, but not particularly famous family. Most of the members seem not to have been wealthy enough to run for higher office, and Octavian’s immediate line had never produced a consul. Octavian’s grandfather was the first one in his branch of the family to have a noticeable fortune: Marc Antony and his allied made fun of Octavian as the “grandson of a money lender.”

The other main branch of the family, descended from a Gnaeus Octavius who was praetor in 205 BC, produced several consuls between 165 and 50 BC.

There seems to have been another set of Octavii who were active in naval affairs; one actually commanded part of Antony’s fleet at Actium.
