Cleopatra’s children with Marc Antony, [Cleopatra Selene II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_Selene_II), [Alexander Helios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Helios), and [Ptolemy Philadelphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_Philadelphus_(son_of_Cleopatra)) all survived the war of Actium. The two boys don’t leave any further traces in the historical record, but Selene married king [Juba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II) of Mauretania. Her line is traceable down to about the end of the first century (see [Are the direct descendants of Cleopatra aware of their legacy?](https://www.quora.com/Are-the-direct-descendants-of-Cleopatra-aware-of-their-legacy/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=ac341f39&srid=zLvM)). The TLDR is that there’s no clear way to trace anyone directly back to Cleopatra after about the year 75.
