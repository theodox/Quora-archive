No, the origins of Roman religion are shrouded in prehistory but they are clearly derived from Indo-European mythology and cultural practices.

You can see Rome’s religious filiation clearly in the core Roman deities, who have clear counterparts in other Indo-European traditions — for example, Jupiter’s name was originally something like _djous pater_ , “father bright-sky” which matches up neatly with the Greek Zeus, the Sanskrit Dyaus, and many other sky-gods with related names.

Early Roman ritual behavior also seems to come primarily from a shared Indo-European tradition as well. For a long time the dominant way of looking at this connection was the work of [George Dumezil, ](https://norse-mythology.org/introduction-georges-dumezil/)who attempted to identify common social, political, and religious structures in societies across the wide reach of the Indo-European languages. Nowadays we tend to be less confident about ascribing _every_ cultural feature from Scotland to Samarkand to deep Indo-European prehistory. Nevertheless, the fact remains that both the language and the practice of Roman religion share much more with their European neighbors than they do with any culture on the far side of the Mediterranean.

The major external influence on Roman religion was the culture of the enigmatic [Etruscan](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Etruscan) civilization, which was centered in today’s Tuscany, and which had an outsized influence on the early growth of Rome. Traditionally, the last three of the seven kings of Rome were Etruscans — while this period of Roman history is known mostly through later legends, [archaeology confirms the strong influence of Etruscan material culture at Rome in the city’s early centuries](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-archaeological-evidence-for-the-Roman-Kingdom/answer/Steve-Theodore).

The geographic and linguistic origins of the Etruscans are mysterious. We can’t really categorize their language, though we have a few texts. Ancient traditions tied them to northwestern Asia Minor and there is some genetic evidence to back that up — however it’s far from a slam-dunk. Their[ art and architecture clearly interacted with Greek models but are quite distinctive](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/etru/hd_etru.htm).

Wherever they came from, the Etruscans played a major role in the evolution of Roman religion. The most obvious borrowing is the eminently “Roman” art of divining the future by reading entrails (“[haruspicy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruspex)”) — the Romans themselves called the arts of fortune-telling the _[disciplina Etrusca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_religion#Etrusca_Disciplina)_ _,_ and any Roman fortune-teller would be sure to include some colorful Etruscan details (real or imagined) to lend authenticity to their claims. We even have some Etruscan ritual paraphernalia which illustrates the proper way to read the meaning of a sheep’s liver:

Here there is a very distant connection to Mesopotamian practices. We do have example of similar artifacts from Babylon:

However the connection is indirect — many civilizations picked up the art of haruspicy during the Bronze Age, and it’s not clear how much of this was direct influence and how much parallel development. The usual scholarly assumption is that the Etruscans learned the art of liver-gazing from their connection to Asia Minor, since the practice was common among the Hittites of the Bronze Age. The other possibility is that the Etruscans picked it up from the Greeks, who also used liver-divination: it shows up, for example, in Euripides’s tragedy [Electra](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0095%3Acard%3D819):

> … ἱερὰ δ᾽ ἐς χεῖρας λαβὼν
Αἴγισθος ἤθρει. καὶ λοβὸς μὲν οὐ προσῆν
σπλάγχνοις, πύλαι δὲ καὶ δοχαὶ χολῆς πέλας
κακὰς ἔφαινον τῷ σκοποῦντι προσβολάς.

> Aegisthus took the entrails in his hands and inspected them. Now the liver had no lobe, while the portal vein and near-by gall-bladder revealed threatening approaches to the one who was observing it.

In historic times, though, the Greek version seems less sophisticated and less rule-bound while the Etruscan version was highly technical, which makes it likely that the Etruscans were working from a more rigorous Near Eastern tradition. The practice probably reached the ancestors of the Etruscans via the Hittites of central Asia Minor — we’ve found plenty of Hittite liver models too. The Hittites were the ones who imported the Mesopotamian version: most of their liver models were inscribed in Akkadian.

In historic times some variation on the art of liver-reading was practiced by most cultures on the northern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean (as Cicero said in the first century BC, _extis enim omnes fere utuntur., “nearly everybody uses entrails for divination”) ._ It is nonetheless a small but verifiable connection between later Roman religion and Mesopotamian tradition.

However it’s also the only one.

Roman knowledge of Mesopotamia was entirely filtered through Greek sources. The Roman Republic emerged only 50 years before the Babylon fell to the Persians, so Rome never interacted with an independent Babylonian state, and by the time the Romans got around to writing about Mesopotamia most of what they wrote was cadged from Greek sources which themselves were not particularly accurate or perceptive. No Roman knew the great names of Mesopotamian history — they’d never heard of Sennacherib , Asshurbanipal , or Nebuchadnezzar. What their Greek sources did given them were fairy-tales: king [Ninus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninus)and queen [Semiramis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiramis). A particularly well educated Roman might have heard of [Sardanapalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardanapalus), who — if you really squint — might be the historical Assurbanipal transformed into a caricature of “oriental decadence.” Roman ignorance of Near Eastern history is quite profound: you really cannot make a case for Babylonian heritage at Rome.



__Bonus round__ 

In much later times there has been a small, busy industry trying connect the Vatican (a different “Roman religion” from the inspection of livers) to Babylon. The key argument here seems to be vague similarity of a bishop’s [mitre ](https://www.britannica.com/topic/miter)and the outfit of a Babylonian priest.

There are quite a few problems with this theory (which , oddly, is equally beloved of some evangelicals and ardent atheists). The most obvious one is that the Babylonian priest (not of Dagon — Dagon comes from the Levant, not Babylon) isn’t wearing a hat at all: he’s _literally wearing a fish._ 

The Babylonians believed they had learned all the important arts of civilization from the [Apkallu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apkallu), a race of demigods who lived in the primordial waters and who emerged to teach primitive man how to live a civilized life. These _apkallu_ were depicted as human-fish hybrids: sometimes as mermen and sometimes as fish wish human faces. So magical practitioners and priests symbolized their access to esoteric knowledge by wearing the tanned skin of a _puradu_ -fish, a sort of large carp, as a cape. Sort of like Batman’s cowl — but a fish, complete with scales and a tail, as you can see in this example:

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d4084c994d604764fcdcc51180c53dfc-lq)

_An Apkallu (right) in his fish-cloak — either an actual demigod or a depiction of a worshipper wearing a fish-cloak for ritual purposes — offers water from his bucket to the god Ea (left). Circa 650 BC, when Rome was a small and obscure city-state. Photo:_ _[Osama Shukir Muhammad Amin](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:God_Ea_%28Sumerian_Enki%29_with_a_fish-cloaked_apkallu,_part_of_a_basalt_water_basin_from_Assur,_Iraq._Reign_of_Sennacherib,_7th_century_BCE._Pergamon_Museum,_Berlin.jpg)_ 

Connecting the dress of an Apkallu to a Christian mitre is big jump. The fish-cape costume disappears around the time when Alexander the Great conquered the Persian empire, but the Roman episcopal mitre only shows up in the 11th century — a gap of about 1,500 years. The early mitres were just pointed caps, too: the split shape didn’t emerge for another couple of hundred years.

If there really were some kind of connection between the old Apkallu costume and church headgear it would be more logical for it to show up in the Syriac or Assyrian churches, both of which grew up in areas steeped in Mesopotamian culture. However here’s the formal headgear of the Assyrian church:

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-174bc63d7e79c96bbf52c56c465e06ff-lq)

And here’s the Syriac version:

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c36a068cfa322cfb194532aa17881a4c-lq)

Neither, as you can see, is easily mistaken for a carp. To be fair, the Chaldaean patriarch of Babylon — actual Babylon, in Iraq — does wear a two-part mitre these days:

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ddd8e0c2d950d10232ae085cb6d1b32a-lq)

But the Chaldaean church is part of the Roman Catholic church, so it’s not surprising. The adoption of the western-style mitre for the Chaldaean church is fairly recent: the historic headdress of the Chaldaean clergy is the cylindrical [shash](https://baghdadhope.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-patriarch-with-strange-headgear_29.html), which actually does have roots in the clothing of ancient Mesopotamia.

So — just in case you are wondering — the bishop’s mitre doesn’t come from Babylon and the Pope isn’t working for the annunaki.
