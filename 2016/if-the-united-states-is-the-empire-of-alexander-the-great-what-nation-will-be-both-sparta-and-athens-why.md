Hmm.. I’m not sure it’s a good comparison to start with.

The key thing about Alexander’s empire is that it was incredibly fragile. There really was no “empire”: there was Alexander, his outsized personality, and his very effective army — at least, until the return trip from India when all three began to fall apart. The whole thing fell apart within a decade of his death, at least as a political entity; and as an ideology it had little to offer except the glamor and charisma of Alexander’s legend.

America, whatever its faults, is incomparably richer in institutions than Alexander’s empire, and — despite being in a contentious phase — has a much more coherent ideological foundation as well.

In pure power-politics terms, you _might_  cast the UK and France into the two roles of Athens and Sparta. Athens / UK has a bit of the outsized cultural cachet that Athens has; Sparta / France tends to be a bit sulky and inward-looking as Sparta notably was during that period. We strive to be nicer to both than we are really obliged to be by pure _realpolitik_  reasons because of historical ties. But I don’t think the comparison is more than superficial.

If you want an analogy, the US as Rome and Europe as Greece works better; _Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit_  _et artes intulit agresti Latio._
