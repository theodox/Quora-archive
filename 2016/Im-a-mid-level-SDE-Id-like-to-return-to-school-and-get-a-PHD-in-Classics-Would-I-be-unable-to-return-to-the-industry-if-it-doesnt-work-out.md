# I'm a mid-level SDE, I'd like to return to school and get a PHD in Classics. Would I be unable to return to the industry if it doesn't work out?

I don’t want to be discouraging… so I’ll suggest you read [this article](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bs7XrWEs0tUjAPH2j0vU7cqN670uteNTfmZl0vhlg1Y/edit#).

The scary part is quite simple: the jobs market of Classics PhDs is pretty terrible, and unlikely to improve in the forseeable future. There are too many qualified people chasing too few jobs. Getting a PhD in the humanities is currently a pretty tough value proposition, and it’ll stay that way until the supply shrinks, PhD programs start being pickier, or higher ed radically re-invents itself.

The bright side which the article points out, and which I hope is true, is that there’s a growing opportunity for people who are interested in antiquity to marry their love of the subject with all of the amazing new tools that are coming on line in modern scholarship. From traditional databases to geospatial tagging to statistical analysis of literary texts there are some fascinating options for a would-be classicists to combine ancient subjects and modern tech. So, maybe a program like the [Digital Humanities](http://asegrad.tufts.edu/academics/explore-graduate-programs/digital-humanities) at Tufts would offer a better mix of opportunities than a straight up philology degree — particularly if you’re already comfortable with digital technology. More about the program [here](http://sites.tufts.edu/perseusupdates/2016/09/26/considering-a-post-bac-in-classics-think-about-the-new-ma-in-digital-tools-for-premodern-studies-at-tufts/), in a post aimed pretty squarely at people like you.

All that said, computing in general tends to be less obsessed with credentialism than many other fields. If you’re on top of the hot tech trends — and particularly if you’re a known contributor on relevant OS projects — you’ll have some insurance. If your academic work had a digital tinge, the business case is also a lot easier to make.

However you decide, make your decision knowing that the odds are steep: out of 22 people who started in my PhD program year (and this was in the early 90’s, when things were less dire!) only 2 finished their degrees and neither of them is employed as a tenured professor. The rest of us - myself included - looked around at the availability of jobs and the likelihood of a good career and found other ways forward.

Sorry to be a downer, but the humanities in general are in crisis and the study of Classics in particular doesn’t have deep wellsprings of support from the people who control the purse-strings of academia. Don’t let me put you off the subject, which is wonderful, richly rewarding, and well worth your time. It is simply a hard way to pay the bills.
