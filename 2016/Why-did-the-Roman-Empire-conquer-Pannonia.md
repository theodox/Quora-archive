It was a classic case of imperial creep: you take one area to protect an area you already control... which then obliges you to take more territory to protect what you now have The area was primarily a negative priority for the Romans: it wasn't particularly wealthy and the locals were famously warlike -- the Romans only really cared about it because the northern end of Illyria close enough to the Veneto to be dangerous to Italy, and the southern end was a constant source of friction with Roman possessions in Macedonia.

The Romans had been involved with the Adriatic peoples for a long time, at least as far back as the 250's BC. Most of the major peoples along the Adriatic were reluctant Roman clients: they more or less ran their own affairs at home but paid tribute to Rome, and the Romans suppressed their traditional fondness for piracy and fighting each other. 

During the war between Caesar and Pompey different groups in the area backed different sides -- and the general distraction of the Romans allowed all of the peoples of Illyria to pay less attention to Roman wishes. After Caesar's death, Brutus was dispatched to bring the area back into the fold. However the pacification was pretty incomplete -- after another round of civil wars Octavian in 35 BC had to return to the area again to try to restore the status quo. 

The main target of the expedition was the Illyrian tribe of [Dalmatae,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatae) who had always been the most restive group in the area. The fighting was harder than expected (it didn't help that the Delmatae had sided with Pompey against Octavian's adoptive father, Caesar -- or that the hard-fighting Delmatae nearly ended Octavian's career before he could become emperor Augustus with a couple of well-aimed rocks).

The Pannonians -- a mix of Illyrians and Celtic peoples who lived in the interior, beyond the mountains which had been the traditional limit of Roman interest -- fought on the side of the Delmatae against the Romans. This may have been ethnic solidarity, or it may have just been another set of warlike people spotting a chance for plunder. In either case Octavian took some of their territory on the Sava river (just over the pink-green line in the map above) during the fighting. By around 32 BC the Illyrian coast -- and this new slice of the interior -- became the new Roman province of [Illyricum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyricum_(Roman_province)). 

However the area was never really pacified: there was more fighting in Illyrian and Pannonia which tended to lead to the same domino-effect advance of the Roman frontier. Another war -- or more accurately, a series of wars -- was fought between 12 and 8 BC including the Delmatae again and a larger group of Pannonians (and, ominously, the Dacians from farther inland who would be a longer term threat to the Romans). Around the same time they absorbed the client kingdom of Noricum to the northwest which increased their interest in stability along the Danube even more.

The drama still had one more, climactic act.

The Delmatae rebelled again in 6 AD, and this time the revolt spread quickly across the whole of the western Balkans. The [Great Illyrian Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellum_Batonianum) was a much, much more serious fight than any of the previous Illyrian and Dalmatian wars: Suetonius, at least, claimed it was the worst threat to Italy since the days of Hannibal. Contemporary Roman accounts suggest 800,000 Illyrians* were involved. 

The Roman response was not the typical punitive frontier expedition: it was a big, coordinated offensive from three sides involving 10 entire legions and a corresponding number of auxiliaries, at least 100,000 warriors. Augustus even enrolled slave volunteers for the legions: a step not taken since the Punic Wars.

 The campaign played out in 3 fairly bloody years: the Romans stuck to a conventional playbook and ground the rebels down. In the aftermath the broke up local tribes and resettled them to prevent another coordinated outbreak (they also began moving auxiliary troops away from their home provinces, having learned their lesson the hard way). The Romans pushed their permanent frontiers up to the Danube, since it was an obviously defensible frontier and provided a continuous line of defense from Noricum in the northwest to Moesia in the southeast. 

However, the final settlement stuck: Pannonia and Illyricum remained solidly Roman for the next 400 years (Pannonia became a separate province some time in the first century). The area was the core of Roman power in the Balkans: the great legionary camp at [Sirmium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirmium), just west of Belgrade, was the key Roman military headquarters in the Balkans until the onset of the Huns in the mid 5th century, and was even briefly one of the capitals of the empire under the Tetrarchy. Between them Pannonia and Illyria produced more than 20 Roman emperors.
