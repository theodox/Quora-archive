# I am trying to work out the relationship between the Latin word 'lanista' (owner of a gladiator school) and the Latin words for sword (gladius, ensis). What does the root word of lanista mean?

The only ancient source that gives a derivation — Isidore of Seville, writing in the 7th century so three hundred or more years after the gladiatorial games had been shut down — says the root word is from Etruscan and means “executioner”.

However it’s more plausibly derived from _[lanius](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DL%3Aentry+group%3D7%3Aentry%3Dlanius)_ , “butcher” and/or “_[lanio](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DL%3Aentry+group%3D7%3Aentry%3Dlanio1)_ ”, “to tear or rip apart.”

_Lanius_ in old Latin is _lacnius_ , from an old Indo-European root _lac-_ or _lek-_  meaning to tear apart. Etruscan is not clearly or even probably an Indo-European language, and the extension from “butcher” to “gladiator trainer” is quite natural, so it’s more likely that Isidore is guessing based on the knowledge that the games had Etruscan roots.

ah, [Nick Nicholas](https://www.quora.com/topic/Nick-Nicholas-Quora-user), if only you were here to correct my phonology!
