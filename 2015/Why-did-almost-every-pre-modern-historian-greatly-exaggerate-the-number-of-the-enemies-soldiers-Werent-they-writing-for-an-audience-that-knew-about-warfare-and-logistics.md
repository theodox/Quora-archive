# Why did almost every pre-modern historian greatly exaggerate the number of (the enemies) soldiers? Weren't they writing for an audience that knew about warfare and logistics?

I think the other answers may be exaggerating the tendency of ancient historians to exaggerate.

There are several other issues in play as well:

__Effectives.__  In modern armies, we say that a unit has a 'paper strength' -- the ideal arrangement as set down by law or protocol. Very few units are actually at paper strength, however: in action there are casualties; on the march there are stragglers; at any point in time there are groups on detached duty, sick in hospital, and other missing numbers. Part of the process of estimating strengths in a historical context is guessing the number of effectives -- actually present at the battle - and how it differs from the paper strength. 

Before the 19th century, few armies had good enough record keeping to record the differences in detail: presumably commanders had more accurate count, but if a historian knows only that the such-and-such legion or so-and-so division is present at a battle, it's easy to fall back on the (almost always inflated) theoretical numbers. To take a very recent example, consider this civil war infographic:

The graphic itself implies that the 'paper strength' of an army could vary between as little as about 20,000 to more than 80,000 -- and that's only covering differences in organization, not counting the factors I mentioned above. A 23d century historian, working from fragmentary records, could provide a lowball account of an army-level battle like Shiloh that ranged from 20-30,000 fighters (using low estimates and assuming an effective strength of 50% for both sides) to a high of 150,000. The best-guess figures are actually closer to 110,000 total, but we know that thanks to 19th century record keeping and even there the figures are less reliable the harder you look. If you are Polybius, interviewing a Roman veteran of Zama and you're told that the 5th and 6th legions fought there, you have the same problem to solve: what does that mean in numbers? This is particularly true when so many armies had unit names which misleadingly indicated a numerical component (the Roman 'century' of 100 varied over time; in political context, a century could consist of thousands!). 

__Camp followers__ . Ancient armies always travelled with a cloud of non-military attendants. An officer might bring along a dozen slaves to handle baggage, cook meals, polish armor and take dictation. Private soldiers might have servants as well -- a squad might hire a local or impress a prisoner to carry bags and scrounge for food. Many armies were attended by wives and children, as well as merchants, hangers on, prostitutes, and sightseers (this practice diminished over the 19th century, but even in the Civil War armies were accompanied by a cloud of civilians). The distinction between soldiers and civilians, however, was fuzzy -- the enemy camp, which often included civilians as well as guards and supplies, was a target in battle, and after a victory the camp followers usually joined in stripping the dead and any looting that could be done.

It's easy to see how this can also exaggerate the size of an ancient army to the eyes of witnesses -- to civilian eyes, an army of 10,000 with another 5,000 camp followers might look like an army of 15,000.

__Indefinites.__  Greek, like Chinese, often uses 10,000 ( a _myriad_ ) as an indefinite number for "a lot", the way we might say "I have a million things to do today". Unfortunately its also used as a military unit. It's easy to see how this sort of thing makes life worse for the historian doing estimates.

All that said it's certainly true that ancient historians didn't have the same devotion to numerical precision that we have; but they were not randomly guessing. Many modern revisionist counts are just as wooly and contradictory as the ancient accounts they intend to correct, based on the historians sense of "what must have happened" rather than any written or archaeological evidence. 

We often read the sources wrong, too -- for several hundred years, scholars discounted the account of the [Battle of the Teutoburg Forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest) given by Dio Cassius as a late reconstruction (the wiki page linked, in fact, does so!) but since the 80's we've actually found the battlefield and it confirms many of Cassius' details quite well.
