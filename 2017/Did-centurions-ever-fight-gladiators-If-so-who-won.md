There were some encounters during the [Servile Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servile_Wars) — the three large-scale slave insurrections that the Romans faced. The last and most famous of those, the [rebellion of Spartacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servile_Wars), was led by gladiators.

The gladiator army did fairly well against the Roman forces it faced. They defeated several Roman armies in 73 and 72 BC. It’s hard to judge how much of that success had to do with the cadre of gladiators in the rebel forces and how much had to do with Roman incompetence or an arrogant unwillingness to take the slave revolt seriously.

It’s worth noting, though, that ‘[centurions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centurion)’ isn’t really a class of fighter. A centurion — literally a “commander of 100” though the real number under a centurion could vary a lot— was a career officer of the Roman army.

The Romans did not have anything like the finely graduated ranks of a modern army; you had footsloggers on the bottom, aristocratic generals (who typically only served a few campaigns before returning to civilian politics) at the top, and in between them the centurions who filled a variety of roles ranging from what we’d think of as “senior NCO” up to “colonel”.

Centurions were the institutional core of the Roman military. They were usually from the Roman equivalent of the middle class: people with property and some education, but without the wealth and prestige to be active in politics. They were generally professional volunteers, rather than draftees or political appointees. They did play important roles in front line fighting — they led from the front, not the rear — but their primary value was leadership and not hand-to-hand fighting.
