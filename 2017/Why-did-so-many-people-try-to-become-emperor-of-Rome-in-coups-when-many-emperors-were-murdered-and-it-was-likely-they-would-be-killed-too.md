# Why did so many people try to become emperor of Rome in coups when many emperors were murdered and it was likely they would be killed too?

The stats are a bit misleading.

There were [between 85 and 100 recognized emperors — depending on how you count — ](https://www.quora.com/How-many-Roman-emperors-were-there)from Augustus to the fall of the West. That’s not an impressive average for roughly 500 years (by contrast there have been 66 sovereigns of England since King Alfred, over well more than a millennium.).

However a closer look shows that 34 emperors ‘reigned’ during [the crazy years of the third century](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/thirdcenturycrisis_article_01.shtml), which saw two complete generations of civil war and rival claims — most of the truly short-lived emperors fall into this period of chaos. The number is also inflated by the fact that the _next_ round of civil wars — the one that followed Diocletian’s peaceful abdication in 305 and ended with Constantine’s triumph in 324 — always involved claimants in multiples since Diocletian’s system had deliberately divided the empire between two pairs of rulers in the east and the west. That adds a total of 8 “emperors” reigning in various degrees of legitimacy over twenty years. Throw in two other short catfights — the [Year of the Four Emperors ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Four_Emperors)and [Year of the Five Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Five_Emperors) — and that figure of 90-ish emperors in 500 years becomes 40-ish emperors in _400_  years, along with 50-ish participants in complex, multi-part civil wars — one of which dragged on for two or three generations.

So, the numbers are less dire than they look at first glance.

Still, the key weakness of the Roman state really goes all the way back to the Republic, where powerful generals like [Marius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Marius), [Sulla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla), [Pompey,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey) and Julius Caesar over-awed civil society. The empire was created by a successful military coup and never outgrew its roots — ambitious generals all knew quite well how a successful and ambitious imperator could end up wearing the purple. The soldiers, for their part, never forgot that it was their swords which really determined who sat on the throne… and that grateful usurpers could be very generous.

Despite all that, though, the many would-be emperors weren’t all power mad lunatics. The third century was bad for a number of reasons, and many of the emperors in that century were essentially pushed into the struggle by factors that had little to do with personal ambition.

__imperial defense:__ 

The rise of the [Sasanian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire) in Persia was the first great-power challenge Rome had to face after Augustus. The Parthians had never been effective at threatening the Roman East, and in the second century they had weakened themselves severely with internal conflicts (allowing Roman legions to mark all the way down the Euphrates, capturing the Parthian capital at Ctesiphon in 116). But after about 230 the Sassanians were a serious, aggressive threat to the Roman east. [Gordian III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_III) was either killed in battle by the Sassanians (as Persian sources claim) or murdered by his troops for failing to defeat them (as Roman sources do). [Valerian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerian_(emperor))was defeated and captured — and used as a footstool —by the Persians.

The third century also so increased activity on the Balkan frontier. [Severus Alexander ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severus_Alexander)was assassinated because — husbanding resources to confront the Persians — he paid off Germanic tribes rather than punishing them. Major invasions in the north confronted [Gallienus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallienus), [Claudius Gothicus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius_Gothicus) and [Aurelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian) among others.

The needs of military continuity, the lack of any clear constitutional arrangements for succession back at Rome, and the long communications lag between the frontiers and the capital meant that an emperor who died in the field (whether from ‘natural’ causes or due to a mutiny) was going to be replaced on the spot — no matter what people back in Rome, or in the other military theaters, thought. The fuzzy line between “field marshal” and “emperor” (_imperator_ really just means “commander”, after all) produced a lot of claimants to the throne.

__regionalism__ 

A persistent theme of the civil wars is their regional character. The emperor was the fountain of all forms of privilege — which meant that an emperor tied too closely to one part of the empire would have poor political connections and weak patronage ties in the rest of the Roman world. Local elites, not surprisingly, did not like to be cut off from the political and economic rewards of the center, particularly when it was the fortunes of war on a distant frontier that might suddenly place a new man on the throne. Influential civilians might find it more appealing to back a local candidate who might cut them in on a share of the rewards of power. Backing even a losing candidate could be a good bargaining move for a regional interest group to make sure they got their slice of patronage when the dust settled. Good examples of regional candidates include include [Gordian I ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_I)and [Elagabalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus).

Of course regionalism also meant that the civil wars in this period usually splintered along the liines of various military commands. The ultimate expression of that dynamic is the 260’s and 270’s, when the empire essentially split into three units, each corresponding to the big main military commands of the day: the [Gallic Empire ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Empire#Origins)in the west, the [Palmyrene Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyrene_Empire) in the east, and the rump “Roman” empire in the center. Both [Postumus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postumus), the ‘founder’ of the Gallic Empire, and [Odenaethus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odaenathus), the founder of the Palmyrene, were successful theater commanders who had defended Rome from outside invasion but whose prestige in their own regions was so high that they were essentially forced to choose between aspiring to the throne and death: in the crisis of the third century no emperor wanted subordinates more popular and successful than himself.

__the troops__ 

The last big factor to remember is the role of the armies themselves. Civil wars put a premium on the loyalty of field troops — which, since the day of Marius and Sulla, had long had a strong element of mercenary self interest. The trend goes all the way back to the era of Nero and Caligula when the[ Praetorian guard](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-praetorian-guard-of-Rome) became the arbiters of imperial succession. The most shameless episode happened when [Didius Julianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didius_Julianus) basically bought the imperial throne at auction from the Praetorians. Backing the winning claimant for the throne could mean a windfall to the troops (and it’s worth noting failure to pay the expected bonus, or “[donativum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donativum)”, could also prove fatal for a tight-fisted emperor.)

There are many, many examples of legionaries pushing their commanders into contending for the throne. In many cases it seems like the main reason were those alluded to above: military necessity or regional politics. But in other cases the motive seems primarily to have been the hope of securing a healthy payout for themselves. The ranks of pushed-from-behind emperors include [Decius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decius), [Carus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carus), and [Magnus Maximus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus) to name a few.



TLDR: It was ultimately the politics of the Roman army as a whole — with its decentralized structure, its ties to different regional elites, and its hunger for money — which drove the rapid succession of emperors in periods instability. The Romans never really created either powerful dynastic loyalty (like later European kings) or strong institutional checks on military power to keep the army out of politics. The ambitions of individuals mattered sometimes — but the interests of the legions mattered more.
