Before the Persians encountered the Greeks the kingdom of [Lydia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia) was the dominant power in Asia Minor. Several Greek cities (including the very important cities of [Ephesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesusand) and [Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miletus), which at that date were among the wealthiest cities in the Greek world) were either allied to or conquered by the Lydians. The Lydians generally got good press in the Greek world -- [Croesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croesus), the last king of Lydia, is depicted in Herodotus as a wise (if unlucky) ruler and a sage. He also made notable donations to Greek temples, particularly the Oracle at Delphi, so he was not an unpopular overlord.

The Persians conquered Lydia in 547 BC. Strictly speaking it was the fault of the Greek gods: Croesus was considering attacking the Persians, and he asked the oracle at Delphi (with which he was quite friendly) what would happen if he did. "You will destroy a great empire" was Apollo's reply. Unfortunately he neglected to specify _which_  empire. It turned out to be Croesus's.

The Greek subjects of the Lydians became subjects of the Persians.

_The Persians considered burning Croesus alive after his defeat in 547 -- in Greek tradition, though, the Gods intervened to spare him._ 

The Persians usually governed through local proxies. In the Greek cities of Asia Minor they generally found it easier to work through local strongmen (the Greek word is _tyrannos,_ ie "tyrant" -- but in Greek it does not have the nasty connotations that word has in English). 

One of the Persian-supported tyrants, [Aristagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristagoras) of Miletus, turned on his Persian masters when it looked like they might replace him. He incited the other Greek cities [to rebel agains the Persians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Revolt) in 499 BC. He managed to get Athens to contribute to the war effort as well. Athens spoke the same Greek dialect as Ephesus and Miletus and was culturally closer to them than to its mainland neighbors, and for this reason we usually call this war the "[Ionian Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Revolt)"

The Ionian army got as far as the old Lydian capital of Sardis and even burned the city. After this initial success the war turned against the Ionians; within about 5 years the Persians had recaptured all of the lost territory.

_Captives of the 'Yaonas' (Ionians) brought before Darius. The Persian word, incidentally, becomes the name for 'Greek' in both Hebrew (_ ___Yavanim___ _) and Sanskrit (_ ___Yavanas___ _)_ 

 Emperor Darius I did not forgive or forget the presence of the Athenians, however -- he appointed a slave to find him every day and whisper to him "_Remember the Athenians!"_ In 492 he made a large show of force on the European side of the Bosporus, forcing several northern Greek states -- including, ironically, Macedonia -- to offer him '[earth and water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_and_water)' as a token of submission. In 490 he sent a naval expedition to attack Athens by sea: this was defeated at [Marathon](http://www.ancient.eu/marathon/), the first battle of the Greco-Persian wars which would continue on until Alexander's final destruction of the Persian empire in 331.

_You asked me to remind you..._ ___Remember the Athenians___ _!_
