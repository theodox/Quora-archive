Not really: this is one area where portfolio rules the day.

The main place credentials will come in to play is that very large companies — of which there aren’t that many anymore — may sometimes let HR people screen resumes before they get to the art staff — the screeners may lighten their workload by checking the credentials box. If you’ve ever had a paid professional job as a concept artist, however, that almost certainly counts for more than what kind of diploma you have, if any.

Most companies, however, are more likely to look for a well executed portfolio than anything else.
