He did actually rule as a pharaoh, but it’s hard to argue that he was the last.

Alexander, it should be remembered, wasn’t perceived as a conqueror by the Egyptians: he was seen as the liberator who drove out the hated Persians, who had occupied Egypt for most of the previous two centuries. [He made a special point of respecting traditional Egyptian culture and religion](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=a89a8f4c&srid=zLvM), and was rewarded with popular enthusiasm. One way you could accurately call Alexander the “last pharoah” is by pointing at a popular folk-story which circulated in Egypt after his death. According to the legend, which lasted into the European middle ages, the last native pharaoh ([Nectanebo II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectanebo_II), driven out by the Persians about 10 years before Alexander’s conquest) was actually Alexander’s biological father, thanks to some magical shape-shifting. This unlikely tale is an index of how popular Alexander was in Egypt — Egyptians claimed him for their own.

However, from a more literal point of view there were plenty of others who ruled Egypt in the tradition of the pharaohs. The [Ptolemaic dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty), founded by one of Alexander’s generals after Alexander’s death, ruled Egypt for another three centuries. While they ruled as Greek kings in the eyes of their Greek subjects, the followed Alexander’s lead in using the iconography of traditional Egyptian royalty with their Egyptian subjects. The last and nowadays the most famous of the Ptolemies was [Cleopatra](https://www.ancient.eu/Cleopatra_VII/) ( technically, Cleopatra VII) who finally lost control of Egypt to the Romans in 30 BC.

_An image of Cleopatra (at right, dressed as a male pharoah) offering to Isis (at left). It’s an interesting image because Cleopatra was an enthusiastic devotee of Isis, and often appeared in public dressed as Isis: so here male Cleopatra is offering sacrifices to herself._

You could make a case for Cleopatra as ‘last pharaoh’, since after her death Egypt was ruled by a series of absentee Roman emperors. Because the emperors were far off,[ their status as “pharoahs” was very ambiguous](https://www.quora.com/After-the-death-of-Cleopatra-did-the-title-of-pharaoh-become-associated-with-Roman-emperors-How-did-the-Romans-reconcile-the-principate-emperors-with-the-position-of-a-foreign-king/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=77aa535d&srid=zLvM) — however, within Egypt they were always depicted and described in traditional ways. After a couple of centuries this pretense wore a bit thin — by the time his image was made no actual Egyptian had ruled the country for over four hundred years:

However the fiction of continuity lasted all the way up to the fourth century of our era. The best claimant for the title of “last pharoah” is [Maximinus Daia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximinus_II) (reigned 311–313 AD) — his name is the last one we’ve ever found written in the traditional pharoah’s cartouche:
