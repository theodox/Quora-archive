Now that I no longer sport a Gaulish mustache, I suppose it’s relatively safe — though knowing his rep I would probably keep my wife and kids in their rooms for the duration.

Luckily, I have a bottle of pretty stinky Thai fish sauce — I’m sure any Roman would be happy with a wedge of focaccia and some deli ham doused in fish sauce. I’d be curious to see if he shares my fondness for [Wolfgang Puck Hearty Organic Lentil Soup](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Wolfgang-Puck-Organic-Hearty-Lentil-Vegetable-Soup-14-5-oz/17179777), it’s also pretty Roman but he might turn his nose up at food prepared by a Mercury-worshipping German. I don’t have any Falernian, but I bet he’d be surprised at how good a modern Côtes du Rhône can be: he only saw the very infancy of French the wine trade.

It’s be a fun party… We’d be able to bond over our preference for straightforward Latin rather than Cicero and his Atticist folderol. Wed’ commiserate over the indignities of, let us say, _abundantia_ _[calvae](http://www.latin-dictionary.net/definition/7638/calva-calvae)_ _—_ I bet he’d intensely interested in the way Frank Sinatra maintained a stable of “well, it’s a little thin but he still has his hair” [toupees](https://peterschmidt.domains.swarthmore.edu/essays/sinatra/sinatra1.html): as fellow gangsters I suspect Frank and Caesar would get along great.

Could we stage this thing in Caesar’s Palace?

In any case It’d be an excellent opportunity for gossip: _Julie, baby, tell me the truth… is Brutus really your son? And — it’s totally okay to talk about this now — what_ really_happened with King Nicomedes?_ 

I have self installed a Nest and and EcoBee at different times, so I’d be tempted to help just fix the thermostat (there’s a physical Amazon store nearby; we could get this done in two hours). But after trying to teach my late father (born, 1933) how use an iPad I don’t think I want to get myself on the hook as the go-to tech support guy for somebody born in 100 BC.
