The constitution is the legal foundation of the United States. "Stopping looking at it for guidance" is, at best, a highly euphemistic way of saying "start over from scratch." 

The Romans eventually got to that point, after a more than century of intermittent[ civil wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_civil_wars) and bloody persecutions. What they got was a military dictatorship, which lasted about 200 years (less than the US already has) before tearing itself to pieces in another century of military coups and counter-coups. 

No thanks.
