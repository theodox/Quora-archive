If you're relatively new to any kind of programming, you can use a node-based shader editing system like [ShaderFX ](http://www.shaderfx.com/)which nowadays is bundled with Max and Maya , or [mental mill. ](http://mental-mill-artist-edition.software.informer.com/1.0/)That way you can experiment with the way to create visual effects without also fighting against the difficulties of syntax and punctuation.

If you're already comfortable with semicolons, curly brackets and the other paraphenalia of shader programming I'd suggest you download a copy of [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com/)

While Unity's shaderlab specialty language is not precisely the same as industry standards like HLSL or GLSL, the amount of good tutorial material on the web is huge: it's much larger and pitched at a more general audience than the comparable 'real' shader language ecosystems. Plus, there's a great feedback loop in Unity: you type a few lines of code, save, and refresh your view and you can see your changes right there; any shader constants you add will be easily editable as well. Unity will also scale up to 'real' HLSL later if you want -- but if you get to that point you'll be way past level 0.
