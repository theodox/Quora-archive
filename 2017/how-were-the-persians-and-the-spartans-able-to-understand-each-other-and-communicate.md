# How were the Persians and the Spartans able to understand each other and communicate? I understand this might be a stupid question, as each side might have had a translator, however I'm just trying to learn more about this event in history.

The Persian army had a lot of Greeks in it.

There had been Greek cities all up and down the coast of western Asia Minor for more than four hundred years at the time of the Persian Wars. The Persians had conquered them during the reign of [Cyrus the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great), two generations before the Persian Wars, and the Persian army and fleet had sizeable Greek contingents.

In fact, while king Leonidas was preparing his army at Thermopylae his distant cousin — the exiled former king [Demaratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demaratus) — was advising Xerxes before the battle:

> Demaratus said, “You have already heard about these men from me, when we were setting out for Hellas, but when you heard, you mocked me, although I told you how I expected things to turn out. It is my greatest aim, O King, to be truthful in your presence. So hear me now. These men have come to fight us for the pass, and it for this that they are preparing. This is their custom: when they are about to risk their lives, they arrange their hair. Rest assured that if you overcome these men and those remaining behind at Sparta, there is no one else on earth who will raise his hands to withstand you, my King. You are now attacking the fairest kingdom in Hellas and men who are the very best.” What he said seemed completely incredible to Xerxes, so he then asked how they, who were so few in number, would fight against his army. Demaratus answered, “My King, take me for a liar if this does not turn out as I say.” So he spoke, but he did not persuade Xerxes.

Right at the same time as the Spartans were fighting the Persian army at Thermopylae, the Greek fleet was facing off against the Persian navy at [Artemisium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Artemisium). One of their tactics was to leave large messages painted along the shoreline where the Greek crews in the Persian fleet could see:

> "Men of Ionia, that what you are doing is not proper, campaigning against your fathers and wishing to enslave Greece. It would be best if you came on our side. But if this is not possible, at least during the battle stand aside and also beg the Carians to do the same with you. But if you can not do either the one or the other, if you are chained by higher force and you can not defect during the operations, when we come at hand, act purposely as cowards remembering that we are of the same blood and that the first cause of animosity with the barbarians came from you."
