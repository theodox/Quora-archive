Before that, he had no chance.

Octavian (the future Augustus), Marc Antony, and the much less famous [Lepidus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aemilius_Lepidus_(triumvir))were, in theory, the three co-equal “emergency commissioners” of the Republic after the war with Brutus and Cassius. Legally — though, since the law was enacted at sword point, the distinction didn’t mean much — they were supposed to be specially commissioned agents of the Republic charged with restoring public order starting in 43 BC. In practice, they had divided up the Roman world between them and ruled in an uneasy, mutually suspicious alliance of warlords (which for a while also included the the die-hard Republican [Sextus Pompey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Pompey)).

It was never an stable system. Octavian fought a [brief war](http://www.unrv.com/fall-republic/perusine-war.php) against Antony’s brother and wife (!) in 41 BC. Lepidus was forcibly retired in 36 BC. Octavian and Antony patched up an alliance by marriage — Antony married Octavian’s sister [Octavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavia_the_Younger) and went to the east to shore up Roman defense against the Parthians while Octavian settled matters at home. However the east — wealthy, and not as closely tied to the Octavian’s power base in among Julius Caesar’s supporters — started looking more like a power base that Antony could use to fight Octavian than the Parthians. His policies in the east became more and more personal and less and less related to Roman interests.

Throughout the later 30’s Antony’s dalliance with Cleopatra was also a slap in the face to Octavia and thus a provocation to Octavian. Perhaps even worse, Antony also made a big point of [backing the claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donations_of_Alexandria) of [Caesarion,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarion) Julius Caesar’s son by Cleopatra — which challenged the uniqueness of Octavian’s relationship with the by-now deified Caesar.

Relations deteriorated steadily and war seemed inevitable. Antony lost support in Rome by his lavish lifestyle and his repudiation of Octavia, who was a sentimental favorite with the Romans. His will (real or forged) was circulated in Rome making it seem as if he had become determined to rule from Egypt, not Rome, which outraged Roman nationalists. Octavian also orchestrated a propaganda campaign which smeared the Egyptians on (highly improbable) racist and cultural grounds. All of which culminated in the [War of Actium](http://www.livius.org/articles/battle/actium-31-bce/) in 31–30 and the deaths of Antony, Cleopatra, and (in all likelihood) of Caesarion.

When Octavian returned to Rome, therefore, he was the sole ruler of the Roman world — and also the first Roman to occupy that position since Julius Caesar 15 years earlier.

However, Octavian didn’t actually crown himself emperor — in part because of the nationalist propaganda leading up to Actium, and in part as an effort to live down his checkered past as a warlord with a lot of Roman blood on his hands, Octavian made a great show of declaring the age of civil wars over and returning power to the Senate. However the whole business was carefully stage managed; the Senate immediately “freely” requested that he retain extraordinary powers to ensure the restoration of peace and stability. Nominally he was given a variety of legal powers — the immunity and veto power of a tribune, the jurisdiction over the Senatorial order of a censor, and the “imperium maius” or supreme command over Rome’s military. But these were all just verbal gracenotes around the fact that everyone already knew: he was the absolute master of the Roman world. He just chose to be modest about it.

_A pretty good example of the way Augustus preferred to be seen: DIVI F. PATER PATRIAE CAESAR AUGUSTUS. “Son of the deified [Julius], Father of his country, Caesar Augustus” But no reference to his role as monarch_ 

Part of the show was the grant of the unique title “Augustus”, which means something like “most honorable” or “most respected” or maybe even “reverend”; before 27 BC it was a somewhat obscure religious title. Augustus was particularly proud of this title, because it combined both the aura of authority and the aura of old-fashioned Roman piety that was a cornerstone of his claim to “restoring” the Republic. He maintained the facade of being just a particularly respected Senator for the rest of his life.

He did use the title _[imperator](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/imperator/)_  as well, but in Latin it really means something more like “victorious general” than “emperor”. The word only acquired the latter meaning through association with the later Caesars. In Augustus’ day it was an honor which the troops proclaimed to their commander after a particularly striking victory. Octavian was first hailed as imperator by his armies at [Mutina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mutina) in 43. He did however break with tradition by holding onto the title for life — in the Republic you were an imperator only until you celebrated your official triumph. There’s no question that Octavian/Augustus understood the political significance of using “successful general” as a title, and after 27 “imperator” showed up only in times of war — more genteel titles like _[pater patriae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pater_Patriae)_ _,_ “father of the country” were preferred as part of his masquerade as just another Senator.
