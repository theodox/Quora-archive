Generally they didn’t. There were only two serial dating systems that had any real currency in Greece, but neither one was something ordinary people were likely to use much. They were of interest to antiquarians and later to bureaucrats, but most people simply dated things by some local convention, usually the names of a religious or political official such as an archon, or perhaps the reigning king.

The [Olympiad ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad)system followed the 4-year cycle of the Olympic games (it starts with the first Olympiad in our 776 BC). It was mostly useful as a way to get a rough synchronism between the hundreds of local calendars (often, quite messy and unreliable) used in different places: An Athenian would have no idea who a Corinthian meant by “in the archonship of Spercheios” but could get a rough idea from “in the 88th Olympiad”.

The Seleucid Empire of inherited sophisticated Babylonian astronomy along with a part of Alexander’s empire. With a long tradition on continuous astronomical recording, the Babylonians had the notion of continuous time as a way of ordering history. [Seleucus I ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_I_Nicator)chose to count his epoch from our 312 BC, the year when he established his power in Babylon. The Seleucid calendar had some obvious advantages over the traditional hodgepodge and was adopted by other Greek states for bureaucratic purposes, though again most ordinary people continued to use local officials (by this point, usually kings). This counting system became known as the [Seleucid era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_era), or, in the Bible, as the ‘year of the Greeks.’

There’s more in [this post](https://theeducationalblog.quora.com/Serial-Dating-Roman-Style-or-not), which is about the Roman calendar but covers the Greek half of the empire in the Roman period. However the takeaway is that the modern assumption that it’s ‘natural’ for every historical event to be neatly filed under a serial year number is far from natural: it didn’t really become common in Europe until well after the fall of the Roman empire in the west. In the Greek-speaking east the system that finally did take root was not the _anno domini_  system, dated from the Incarnation, but what’s known as the _[anno mundi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Mundi)_ __ system which — somewhat like the modern Jewish calendar — starts with a backdated creation of the world. The Byzantines used our 5509 BC as their start date, all way until the year 7237 (ie, 1728).
