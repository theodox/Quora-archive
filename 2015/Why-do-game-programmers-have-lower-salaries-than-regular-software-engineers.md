Game programmers do well:

Generally speaking, though, a lot of game programmers could do better in other businesses: a high performance game, a 3-d renderer, or a complex real time networking system is a very complex, demanding piece of software, with demands that are on a par with high end defense work, aerospace, or super-high-speed trading for Wall Street, all of which generally pay much better. There's a range, of course -- I've known some pretty bad games programmers -- but the upper end is extremely competitive compared to most programming fields.

All games jobs suffer from the wannabee factor: a lot of people think it's cool to work in games (I know, I'm one of 'em) and this keeps salaries lower than they are for equally difficult but less glamorous (or less fun) lines of work.
