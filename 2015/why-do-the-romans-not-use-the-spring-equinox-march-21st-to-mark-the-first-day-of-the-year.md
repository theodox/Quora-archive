Roman calendars were extremely wonky.

The original Roman calendar seems to have been only about 300 days (304?) long, effectively "missing" two months. January and February were added, allegedly by [Numa Pompilius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numa_Pompilius), in the 8th c BC. They 'counted' as the first two months, throwing off the old count: Here's Roman calendar from just before Caesar's[ calendar reforms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar):

If you look closely you'll see "Quintilis" (QV) and "Sextilis" (SEXT) which should be months 5 and 6 -- and which later became our July (for Julius Caesar, naturally) and August (for Augustus Caesar). as [James Wasvary](https://www.quora.com/profile/James-Wasvary) points out these names all assume a March year start. You'll also see the day counts at the bottom in roman numerals (note several 29's in there) and a column for "Inter" - the Intercalary month which had to be added to adjust for the fact that the whole thing was not very close to 365.25 days and kept slipping out of touch with the solar year. The intercalation was a job of political appointees, and not all of them did a good job keeping time: Caesar had to [reform the calendar](http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/julian-calendar.html) in 45BC, and even that was botched. 

There is probably a connection between Numa's legendary role as a peacemaker and the switch from a March start date. Plutarch says Numa moved January first because "he wished to take every opportunity of intimating that the arts and studies of peace are preferred before those of war" -- March being M_artius,_ the month of Mars (and the traditional start of campaigning season). Numa is famous for having closed the doors of the [Temple of Janus ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Janus_%28Roman_Forum%29)for 45 years -- the longest continuous peace in Roman history. This _might_  be Plutarch making it up based on the association of names, but it's suggestive.
