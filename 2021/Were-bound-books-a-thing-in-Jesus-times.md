We’re not 100% clear on the origins of the bound book or “[codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex)”.

The oldest references to flat-bound books seem to be in the works of the Roman poet Martial — writing around the year 85 — who talks about _libelli_  , which is more like “pamplet” than “books”.

> You who long for my little books to be with you everywhere and want to have companions for a long journey, buy these ones which parchment confines within small pages: give your scroll-cases to the great authors - one hand can hold me

([Martial I.2](https://historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=1899))

It’s notable that Martial’s _libelli_ are parchment, not papyrus; parchment is a lot tougher than papyrus though it’s also more expensive. Elsewhere he describes the libelli as _muliplici pelle. “folded over many times”_ which is usually understood as something like a classic [folio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folio) but might simply mean accordion-folding as an alternative to rolling.

[One passage in Suetonius](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/suetonius/12caesars/julius*.html) is sometimes quoted to argue Julius Caesar invented the _libellus_  form:

> Some letters of his to the senate are also preserved, and he seems to have been the first to reduce such documents to pages and the form of a note-book [_libellus_ ],​ whereas previously consuls and generals sent their reports written right across the sheet.

However clearly these were letters, not intended for permanent storage or bound.

So we’re not sure that exactly when or how the folded-over _libellus_ became the hard-bound _codex._ The best bracket we can offer is that they went from un-heard-of to dominant after Martial and before the fourth century. The oldest surviving fragments of codices date from the mid second century. It’s commonly asserted that early Christian communities lead the way in the adoption of the codex form; certainly, most of our oldest examples of codex writing are Christian texts. Nonetheless this is an inference based on accidents of survival — there may be other reasons we don’t know of.

_[Rylands Papyrus 457](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rylands_Library_Papyrus_P52)_ _, a very early codex fragment, usually dated to the early-mid second century. We can tell it’s from a codex because it’s written on both sides._ 

The combination of portability, durability (no need for “scroll-cases”, particularly if you’re using papyrus) and storability (flat-bound books can be piled up against a wall ; scrolls require a dedicated piece of furniture) was a potent attraction. The superiority of the codex for most practical purposes is one of the reasons we have so vanishingly few manuscripts before the fifth century: most of the works people wanted to preserve were recopied into durable, storable codices and the originals were simply left to molder away.

For the specific case of Judaea in the early first century there are no bound surviving codices, if there ever were any. The [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://www.imj.org.il/en/wings/shrine-book/dead-sea-scrolls) are a good indication that scrolls remained the normal recording method in that time and place; the [Villa of the Papyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_of_the_Papyri) in Pompeii (almost the same time) also contains no codices.
