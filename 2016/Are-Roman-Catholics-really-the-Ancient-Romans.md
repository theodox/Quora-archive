Catholic is just the theological term of art for "universal" or “global”. In early church history it was used to distinguish between the general run of Christian belief and particular local traditions or views. It’s a descriptor for other churches besides the Roman which also claim descent from the original, undivided Christian community — the Anglican, Syrian , Greek, Coptic, Russian and several other churches are “catholic” with a small “c”. The “Roman” is used to distinguish the Vatican’s brand of Christianity from the other catholic churches, and — since the church is headquartered in Rome — it’s the obvious adjective.

Historically, the church took shape under the late Roman Empire. Latin is the official language of the RC church — partly for traditional reasons and partly to emphasize the church’s international character. A lot of the ritual and traditions of the church reflect its late-Roman origins: the robes you see in the celebration of a Catholic mass (the [Dalmatic,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatic) the [Chasuble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasuble), and the [Alb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alb)) are adaptations of 4th century Roman formal wear.
