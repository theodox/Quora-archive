I think it's fair to say there isn't one, or at least that if one ever existed we have never found it.

Egyptian literature — at least the part that wasn't composed for kings, temples, or funerary services — tends toward the short-story format. The most popular pieces were short tales intended to illustrate correct behavior in the face of adversity, There were also tales which seem to be purely for entertainment, featuring [magical wonders and adventures in far-off lands](http://www.masseiana.org/petrie1.htm), but these were a minority among the generally serious eat-your-vegetables stories of virtue and humility.

What we don’t have, though, is long form narratives about heroic individuals. This probably reflects the situation of literacy in Egypt — literacy was a specialist skill for a small, privileged caste of scribes who wrote on behalf of the royal court or the temples. It’s not an accident that a lot of the heroes of Egyptian stories are scribes and bureaucrats, rather than warrior aristocrats. [The tribulations of a junior official trying to negotiate a trade treaty, ](http://ib205.tripod.com/report.html)are fascinating to historians but they don’t exactly form the basis of a vibrant popular literature.

Maybe the best candidate for an “epic” story would be the [tale of Sinuhe](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/sinuhe.htm). Sinuhe (if he was a real person — opinions are divided) was a 12th dynasty court functionary who was caught up in court intrigue following the death of the Pharoah. He flees Egypt to Canaan, and is taken under the wing of a Canaanite chieftain. The scared bureaucrat adapts to “barbaric” life, becoming a trusted advisor to his host. His adventures climax when he defeats a hostile Canaanite warlord in single combat, becoming a wealthy chieftain in his own right. However — a typical Egyptian touch — the crowning glory of his career is permission to return to Egypt, where a rich tomb is prepared for him.

Sinuhe the scribe-turned-hero was a popular figure (his story is repeated in a number of preserved pieces). However it’s stretching the definition of “epic” in that the whole story can be read in five to ten minutes. It’s a bit shorter than Priam’s interview with Achilles at the end of the Iliad.

It’s quite likely that there were alternate Egyptian oral traditions which don’t show up in our written sources. But, unless something surprising turns up in the archaeology, one would have to say there’s nothing in the Egyptian canon with either the literary influence or the depth of characterization and narrative in the Iliad.
