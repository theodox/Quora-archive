For a given value of “could”:

__Antiochus IV, 168 BCE__ 

> When these happenings were reported to the king, he thought that Judea was in revolt. Raging like a wild animal, he set out from Egypt and took Jerusalem by storm. He ordered his soldiers to cut down without mercy those whom they met and to slay those who took refuge in their houses. There was a massacre of young and old, a killing of women and children, a slaughter of young women and infants. In the space of three days, eighty thousand were lost, forty thousand meeting a violent death, and the same number being sold into slavery.

> Not satisfied with this, the king dared to enter the holiest temple in the world; Menelaus, that traitor both to the laws and to his country, served as guide. He laid his impure hands on the sacred vessels and swept up with profane hands the votive offerings made by other kings for the advancement, the glory, and the honor of the place….

__Pompey, 63 BCE__ 

> But when the battering engine was brought near, the greatest of the towers was shaken by it, and fell down; and brake down a part of the fortifications. So the enemy poured in apace: and Cornelius Faustus, the son of Sylla, with his soldiers, first of all ascended the wall: and next to him Furius, the centurion, with those that followed, on the other part: while Fabius, who was also a centurion, ascended it in the middle: with a strong body of men after him. But now all was full of slaughter. Some of the Jews being slain by the Romans; and some by one another. Nay some there were who threw themselves down the precipices, or put fire to their houses, and burnt them; as not able to bear the miseries they were under. Of the Jews there fell twelve thousand: but of the Romans very few. Absalom, who was at once both uncle, and father-in-law to Aristobulus, was taken captive. And no small enormities were committed about the temple it self: which, in former ages, had been inaccessible, and seen by none. For Pompey went into it, and not a few of those that were with him also; and saw all that which it was unlawful for any other men to see, but only for the High Priests. There were in that temple the golden table; the holy candlestick; and the pouring vessels; and a great quantity of spices: and besides these there were among the treasures, two thousand talents of sacred money. Yet did Pompey touch nothing of all this; on account of his regard to religion; and in this point also he acted in a manner that was worthy of his virtue. The next day he gave order to those that had the charge of the temple to cleanse it, and to bring what offerings the law required to God, and restored the High Priesthood to Hyrcanus: both because he had been useful to him in other respects: and because he hindered the Jews in the country from giving Aristobulus any assistance in his war against him.

__Titus, 70 CE__ 

> And now, since [Titus] Caesar was no way able to restrain the enthusiastic fury of the soldiers, and the fire proceeded on more and more, he went into the holy place of the temple, with his commanders, and saw it, with what was in it, which he found to be far superior to what the relations of foreigners contained, and not inferior to what we ourselves boasted of and believed about it. But as the flame had not as yet reached to its inward parts, but was still consuming the rooms that were about the holy house, and Titus supposing what the fact was, that the house itself might yet he saved, he came in haste and endeavored to persuade the soldiers to quench the fire, and gave order to Liberalius the centurion, and one of those spearmen that were about him, to beat the soldiers that were refractory with their staves, and to restrain them; yet were their passions too hard for the regards they had for Caesar, and the dread they had of him who forbade them, as was their hatred of the Jews, and a certain vehement inclination to fight them, too hard for them also. Moreover, the hope of plunder induced many to go on, as having this opinion, that all the places within were full of money, and as seeing that all round about it was made of gold. And besides, one of those that went into the place prevented Caesar, when he ran so hastily out to restrain the soldiers, and threw the fire upon the hinges of the gate, in the dark; whereby the flame burst out from within the holy house itself immediately, when the commanders retired, and Caesar with them, and when nobody any longer forbade those that were without to set fire to it. And thus was the holy house burnt down, without Caesar's approbation.

[Josephus, Jewish War, 6.260 ff.](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekJan2011&getid=1&query=Joseph.%20BJ%206.254) It’s generally believed that Josephus, who ended up working for Titus, is trying to lay the blame for the final destruction of the temple on individual soldiers — Roman sources describe it as deliberate.
