Theseus was a mortal. After his death, he was generally recognized as what the Greeks called a [ἥρως](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%A5%CF%81%CF%89%CF%82), a “[hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_hero_cult).” For them this term was similar to what in English we’d call a “saint” — somebody born mortal but who achieved some kind of special afterlife thanks to his achievements on earth.

Heroes were an important and distinctive aspect of Greek polytheism. Ordinary Greeks practiced a form of family ancestor worship; it makes sense that the hero was a kind of communal extension of the same idea. Heroes were frequently city founders or particularly revered political leaders. Their supernatural assistance was sought through sacrifices and public festivals — a somewhat larger and more public version of the ancestral rites everyone practiced at home.

A select few heroes ([Hercules ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules)and [Asclepius ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asclepius)are the most famous examples) became so popular that they were honored all over the Greek world — they essentially made the jump from heroes to minor gods by transcending their local origins. For the most part, however, heroes were local and their influence was equally local.

Theseus was definitely a local hero: his primary festival was the [Synoikia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synoikia) which celebrated his role in uniting the scattered villages of Attica to form the Athenian state. Rather than far-off Olympus, if a Greek wanted to locate Theseus in this world it would probably be at his shrine (now lost) in Athens, where the hero’s bones were said to reside.
