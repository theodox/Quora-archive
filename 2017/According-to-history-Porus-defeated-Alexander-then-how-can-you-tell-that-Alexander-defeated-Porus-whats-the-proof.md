I wouldn’t quite put it as “according to history” — this is a great example of how ancient history really works, which is by comparing probabilities and not “facts”.

The only surviving written sources — [listed in this answer](https://www.quora.com/Did-Alexander-the-Great-win-against-the-Indian-King-Purushottam-and-was-there-any-historian-that-mentioned-about-it-in-those-days) — are not exactly contemporary, but they are the only ones which actually discuss the battle. They all say that Alexander won. The argument for a Porus victory is basically “well, the Greek sources say Alexander treated Porus very nicely after the battle. To me, that sounds like it’s just a face-saving way of disguising a loss”.

I want to stress that such a reading is not _impossible._ It’s totally conceivable.

The problem is that there’s no particular reason to believe that plausible version over any of several other plausible alternatives: perhaps the whole thing is made up, with Porus playing the part of a noble opponent to show Alexander as a chivalrous victor; perhaps it’s an allegory, with Porus cast as the “barbarian” won over to civilization by the superior manners of Greek civilization; or maybe it’s all garbled up from some ancient Indian story with Alexander slotted in to replace some Indian king from three hundred years earlier; or maybe the army simply mutinied out of homesickness and the historians had to make up a last victory to make it seem less disgraceful.

The hard part is that once you get away from the surviving evidence — no matter how fragmentary and unsatisfactory it is — it’s very difficult to stop going. Sometimes you’re stuck having to say “here’s what the sources tell us, here’s what the archeology says, and here’s what I think that means.”

In this case the problem is made harder by lack of archaeological evidence. Because of the geography of the region the site of the battlefield has never been identified; the Jhelum river has switched courses many times in the intervening centuries so the archeologists don’t really know where to look) . In the absence of higher quality evidence it’s wisest to stick close to the sources because the range of alternatives rapidly approaches infinity once you get beyond that.

As it happens the biggest popularizer of the “Porus Victory” story was none other than [Soviet marshal Zhukov](https://www.rbth.com/blogs/2013/05/27/marshal_zhukov_on_alexanders_failed_india_invasion_25383), addressing an Indian military academy during the height of Indo-Soviet friendliness. In the same way that Alexander’s Greek chroniclers may have had an interest in exaggerating Alexander’s exploits, a high-ranking Soviet official addressing Indian military cadets in 1957 had plenty of reasons to provide a version of events that flattered Indian sensibilities and cast the whole thing in an anti-colonial, anti-western light.
