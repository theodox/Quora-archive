Here’s the text (quoted in its entirety, since it’s not too long):

> Your letter informs me that Sabina, who appointed you and me her heirs, though she has nowhere expressly directed that Modestus shall have his freedom, yet has left him a legacy in the following words: “I give, &c.—To Modestus, whom I have ordered to have his freedom”: upon which you desire my opinion. I have consulted skilful lawyers upon the point, and they all agree Modestus is not entitled to his liberty, since it is not _expressly_  given, and consequently that the legacy is void, as being bequeathed to a slave. But it evidently appears to be a mistake in the testatrix; and therefore I think we ought to act in this case as though Sabina had directed, in so many words, what, it is clear, she had ordered. I am persuaded you will go with me in this opinion, who so religiously regard the will of the deceased, which indeed where it can be discovered will always be law to honest heirs. Honour is to you and me as strong an obligation as the compulsion of law is to others. Let Modestus then enjoy his freedom and his legacy as fully as if Sabina had observed all the requisite forms, as indeed they effectually do who make a judicious choice of their heirs. Farewell.

Evidently Sabina (she’d have been a female relative of Sabinus, and evidently a friend of Pliny’s) intended to free her slave, Modestus, and to leave him a portion of her estate.

It was quite common for Roman slaves to be freed upon the death of a master or mistress. In fact domestic slaves who lived in close proximity with their owners (as opposed to the unfortunates who labored anonymously in the mines or the fields) were [probably more likely to be freed than not.](https://ancientimes.blogspot.com/2016/03/roman-slavery-and-rate-of-manumission.html) However Sabina appears to have failed to follow the proper legal procedure to manumit Modestus in her will. Pliny is suggesting to Statius that Sabina’s intention was clear despite this technical misstep and that the honorable thing to do is to free Modestus and grant him his legacy.

It’s possible that the failure here was the failure to explicitly tell one of her executors to handle the manumission, since Pliny’s quote implies that she clearly expressed the intention to manumit. A freed slave still had certain obligations to their former owner, and in the case of a slave freed in a will, those obligations passed to the owner’s heir. Since Sabina seems not to have specified which of her inheritors was to become Modestus’ patron, that may be the reason the manumission was regarded as invalid.

The law of manumission was quite complex (summarized [here](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Manumissio.html)) but clearly Pliny is trying to encourage Statius to do what Sabina intended. He might be laying on the morality a bit thick because Modestus could not inherit any property if he were not freed — slaves had no property rights — and so Statius might be tempted to retain ownership of Modestus and whatever property Sabina intended to leave him.
