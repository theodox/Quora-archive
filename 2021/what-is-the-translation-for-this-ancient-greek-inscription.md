___EDIT___ _clearly_ _[Dimitris Dervenis](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dimitris-Dervenis)_ _has the correct answer, I’m leaving my wrong one here so readers get a sense of how much work goes into those little cards in museum displays :)_ 

I’m having a really tough time with the photo , it would be great if there were a clearer one.

I’m guessing it’s the same as this one?

Here’s an effort at transcription with word breaks, but I’m only really confident about the second half of lines 2 and 3:

ΕΤΟΥς ΒΛς ΘΕωI ΔΙ [?] BAΙΘ ΜΑP[H?]
ΚΕΡ[?]ωΝ ΔΙΟΔωPΟΥ ΕΚ ΤωΝ
[T?]ΑΓωΝ ΑΝΕΘΗΚΕΝ

I’m not very confident in the translation because the text is so hard to to read.

_year 11 of the king: [Kerron?] son of Diodoros dedicated (this) to the god of Beith Mare from the (spoils) of the commanders_ 

The formula ΔΙΟΔωPΟΥ ΕΚ ΤωΝ ΤΑΓωΝ ΑΝΕΘΗΚΕΝ is readable (apart from the word I have as ΤΑΓωΝ, “of the commanders”) and it’s a standard way to to mark a dedication taken of goods taken in battle. I can’t really read the beginning of line 3, however: it might be ΝΑYAΓωΝ, “of the shipwrecks” instead of ΤΑΓωΝ, “of the commanders”

ΕΤΟΥς is a year marker, but ΒΛς is not a number: I’m betting it’s an abbreviation for ΒΑςΙΛΕΟς, “of the king” — or maybe it’s really ΒΔς for “Basileus Demetrius Soter” — a Seleucid king from 161 to 150 BC. He’s the only candidate for a Seleucid king with the initial D who reigned at least 11 years.

The only good candidate for a number is ΔΙ which is 11. ΘΕωI is “to the god”, ie, the god to whom this object was dedicated. I’m not sure about ΜΑP[H?] at the end of line 1 and ΚΕΡ[?]ωΝ at the beginning of line 2. I translated ΚΕΡ[?]ωΝ as a name, since it is followed by the “of Diodorus” which which usually would be “so-and-so son of Diodorus”. But Kerron isn’t a Greek name I’ve ever seen — the way it’s written it might be ungrammatical, so I don’t have a lot of faith in this part of the translation.

BAΙΘ is not Greek, it’s a Semitic word, probably Phoenician for “house”. Going off the little I could find it seems like it’s as place name — but not being able to read this more clearly I’m mostly guessing. Presumably “Baith Mare” is the place name ?

Overall: It’s clearly a dedication by somebody-son-of-Diodorus. Most of the rest is too hard to read for certainty.
