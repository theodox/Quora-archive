If you're asking for the last _native_  Egyptian Pharaoh, you have to go much farther back. There are two choices: [Psamtik III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psamtik_III) was the last Pharoah who ruled a united, independent Egypt: six months into his reign (525 BC) he was defeated by the invading Persians and Egypt was absorbed into the Persian Empire. [Nectanebo II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectanebo_II) could also be considered the last "true" Pharoah, he was the last leader of [Thirtieth Dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirtieth_Dynasty_of_Egypt), which briefly ejected the Persians and ruled most of Egypt from 380 to 343 BC.

Cleopatra -- the famous one -- was [Cleopatra VII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra), the end of the long line Macedonian/Greek royalty which ruled Egypt from the time of Alexander the Great -- who took it from the Persians -- down to 31 BC. This royal family (the Ptolemies, named after the first of their line [Ptolemy I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter) were foreigners, but they did make a conscious effort to insert themselves into Egyptian traditions: even though their language and culture were Greek they patronized native temples and adopted some important visual symbols to add an Egyptian flavor to what was basically a Macedonian-Greek royal line. They did use the title "Pharoah" when addressing their Egyptian subjects, but in Greek they preferred "Basileus" ("king"). Cleopatra's father was Ptolemy XII, generally known as a weak and disspated king, her mother was another Cleopatra -- the Ptolemies often married cousins or even siblings to keep the royal line in the family.

The Ptolemies invoked traditional Egyptian imagery for the benefit of their Egyptian subjects; but at home among themselves their style was much more "Classical". These images are both of Cleopatra:

Cleopatra was the last of the Ptolemies (she made sure of it: she had her brother and co-ruler, [Ptolemy XIV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XIV_of_Egypt), murdered.) At the end of her reign Egypt became part of the Roman empire.

Julius Caesar defeated Egypt- which had backed his rival Pompey during the Roman civil war of 49-45 BC. However he left Cleopatra on the throne -- they became lovers during his stay in Egypt and he fathered a child with her. Caesar's death lead to another Roman civil war in 31 BC, when Cleopatra allied with Marc Antony against Octavian Caesar (later the Emperor Augustus) . Antony's and Egypt's combined forces were defeated at the battle of [Battle of Actium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium)in 31 BC; they fled back to Egypt, but faced with overwhelming odds Antony and Cleopatra both committed suicide. The victorious new emperor absorbed Egypt into the Roman Empire and Egypt lost its independence for good. So she was the last ruler of an independent ancient Egypt: in that sense the last Pharoah. However [Egyptian language documents referred to subsequent Roman emperors as pharoahs too](https://www.quora.com/Why-were-there-no-more-pharaohs-after-Cleopatra), down to Maximinus Daia in 313 AD.

However, some ancient sources say that [Caesarion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarion), Cleopatra's son by Julius Caesar, was briefly acclaimed as the king of Egypt after Cleopatra and Antony killed themselves. If so, his reign was measured in months: most ancient sources say he was captured and killed, probably on Octavian's orders since he was not only the king of an enemy nation but also a half-Roman with a better claim to the name of "Caesar' than Octavian himself had -- Octavian was a Caesar by adoption, while Caesarion was Julius Caesar's only male child. There is a different tradition which claims he escaped to India with the royal treasury, but that is probably propaganda intended to excuse Octavian from charges of murdering an innocent relative.
