If you are willing to go with a relatively broad definition, I'd nominate __[Ashurbanipal](http://www.ancient.eu/Ashurbanipal/)__ __, King of the Universe__  (officially at least -- though to us moderns he is merely King of Assyria, 668-627 BC).

Ashurbanipal supplemented traditional Assyrian royal pursuits, such as hunting lions and erecting pyramids of human skulls, with a genuine passion for antiquities. His [library](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/all_current_projects/ashurbanipal_library_phase_1.aspx) was the ultimate achievement of Mesopotamian culture, collecting tens of thousands of cuneiform sources from every corner of the Mesopotamian world in Akkadian, Babylonian, Sumerian, Hittite and any other script that could be found. His agents scoured the known world copying inscriptions and artwork. When his armies took Babylon, he preserved and copied (or sometimes, carried off) the precious artwork and inscriptions of the great temples, cataloguing their contents and studying their secrets.

This king was not just a dilettante employing professionals - he was very vain about his antiquarian achievements.

> I, Ashurbanipal, within the palace, understood the wisdom of Nabu [the god of learning]. All the art of writing of every kind. I made myself the master of them all. I read the cunning tablets of Sumer and the dark Akkadian language which is difficult to rightly use; I took my pleasure in reading stones inscribed before the flood. The best of the scribal art, such works as none of the kings who went before me had ever learnt, remedies from the top of the head to the toenails, non-canonical selections, clever teachings, whatever pertains to the medical mastery of [the gods] Ninurta and Gala, I wrote on tablets, checked and collated, and deposited within my palace for perusing and reading.

He was such an antiquarian that he revived imagery and motifes from the distant and mostly obscure past. Here's Asshurbanipal, depicted in the traditional pose of a Sumerian king from 2500 years earlier:

_Ur-Nanshe of Lagash, 2550 BC_ 

Ashurbanipal wasn't just an antiquarian either. Like all Mesopotamian rulers he did (metaphorically at least) get his hands dirty actually poking around in the physical remains of antiquity. Immemorial Mesopotamian tradition demanded that temples be periodically razed and rebuilt, and Assurbanipal -- as king and patron of many temples -- presided over several such renovations. Knocking down a revered ancient building may not sound very 'archaeological' to us but these were primarily built of mud brick: after a few centuries they would degenerate into shapeless lumps. Our archaeological evidence shows that the removals and rebuilding were done very carefully, often with previous foundations and floors cleaned and deliberately preserved beneath new construction. Great care was taken not to deface old works and inscriptions were copied.

To be fair, this wasn't scientific archaeology -- the whole conception of history and historical investigation which underlies modern archaeology was only just beginning to take shape. Ashurbanipal and his workers didn't go looking for historical truths but eternal ones -- the heritage of the gods and of wise ancestors. Still for persistent, systematic and highly productive study of the past I'd say Ashurbanipal deserves at least a nomination.

_Yes, that's a direct quote._ 

Ashurbanipal's contributions earned him an impressive statue at the San Francisco public library, even though the pose is actually stolen from the Sumerian hero Gilgamesh (a borrowing of which Ashurbanipal would probably have approved).
