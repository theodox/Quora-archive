Yes — in fact, Greek and Roman religious observances were almost always outdoors. Ancient temples are not analogous to churches or synagogues — you did not go inside to attend a service.

The characteristic acts of Greek or Roman piety were __sacrifices__ and the taking of __omens__ .

__Sacrifices__  could be very simple (spilling a drop of wine or leaving aside a bit of meal in honor of the goods at home) or very elaborate (ritually butchering hundreds of cattle in a huge open-air ritual). The main requirement was an altar — which could be a small shelf set aside at home, a portable table for, say, an army on the march, or a permanent stone structure. In some cases the “altar” could just be a purpose-dug pit, a βόθρος “_[bothros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothros)_ _”_ where offerings were deposited.

__Omen-taking__ had many forms; the one most familiar in modern times is examining the entrails of sacrificial victims. However the oldest form was examining the flight of birds: “omen” in Greek is οἰωνός, “oionos,” literally a large bird like an eagle or an vulture.

Observing the flight of birds as a way of assessing the future is, obviously, an outdoor activity. Our English word “temple” come from the Latin _templum_ , which doesn’t mean a _building._ It actually refers to a ritually defined open space suitable for a proper observation of the omens. In Greek the same word was τέμενος _“_ _[temenos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temenos)_ _”._ Part of the role of the temenos or templum was to provide a frame of reference for the diviner: observing a lighting flash or an eagle to the _right_  was a good omen, but the same thing to the _left_  was discouraging — so naturally it made sense to have a permanent set of coordinates to define left and right.

The building we think of as a “Greek temple” was, in Greek, the ναός “naos”* — in Latin it was the _aedes_ , the “house” of the God. It’s primary job was to house the cult object of the god — usually a statue, though in some cases it could be another kind of sacred presence. Ordinarily the _naos_ would be built so that the statue could “see” the altar through the its doors, thus receiving the sacrifice “in person,” though this wasn’t always a requirement. The very crowded and irregular terrain in the acropolis of Athens, for example, didn’t leave room for this kind of arrangement on a large scale. However a portable altar could always be set up before the doors of the _naos_ for a particular occasion. Some _naoi_  did include indoor altars but this wasn’t a requirement.

The_ naos _of Apollo housed a statue of Apollo but also many offerings from worshipers and the “_ omphalos_” — a sacred stone believed to mark the center of the world. In front of the temple was the Altar of the Chians, an elevated platform where sacrifices could be performed in public view. There was a small altar inside the building but the outdoor altar was the most important ritual focus. Image:_ _[Greece Ancient and Modern](http://greeceancientmodern.com/delphi.html)_

Any ancient Greek city was full of small sacred areas: small shrines or altars connected to local traditions or historic events were everywhere. Most of them received official attention only once or twice a year, but private devotions happened all the time. This kind of public outdoor religiosity would be instantly familiar to anybody who has visited modern India or Mexico.



*Oddly, _naos_ is also the ordinary word for _ship._ This is the ultimate derivation of the [nave ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave)of a church, which comes to English by way of Latin _navis_ , a ship, as well
