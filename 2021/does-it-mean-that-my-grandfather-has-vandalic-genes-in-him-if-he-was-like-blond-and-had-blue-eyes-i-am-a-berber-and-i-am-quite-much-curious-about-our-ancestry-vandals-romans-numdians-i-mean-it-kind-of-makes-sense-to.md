# Does it mean that my grandfather has vandalic genes in him if he was like blond and had blue eyes? I am a Berber and I am quite much curious about our ancestry, Vandals, Romans, Numdians. I mean it kind of makes sense to me. I love barbarians.

Well, anything is _possible_  but the Vandals in particular will have left a much smaller genetic footprint in North Africa than a lot of the other groups which settled there over time. The whole Vandal migration was not that large: the ancient sources say it was around 80,000 people, and modern estimates tend to assume it was rather lower than that. In addition, the Vandals were effectively a traveling army; since the group was primarily male, there was not a lot of “pure” Vandal reproduction in North Africa. Being quite unpopular with pretty much everyone else in the Mediterranean basin there was no easy route for follow-on migration from the Vandal homeland.*

So, 80,000 people don’t move the genetics of a place like late-Roman Africa by that much: the Vandals capital of Carthage, all by itself, was probably half a million at the beginning of the Vandal kingdom. The whole of Roman Africa — Tunisia and the coasts of Algeria and Libya — was probably in the ballpark of 5 million. Even though [a conquering minority may have a demographic edge](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-indigenous-men-of-Brazil-not-leave-descendants-unlike-the-women-who-became-the-ancestors-of-a-30-of-Brazilians-Has-there-been-a-systematic-extermination-of-indigenous-men/answer/Ygor-Coelho) (at least, for male DNA) , it takes a long period of replenishment from abroad to really change the demographics of a large society. The Vandal kingdom only lasted a hundred years and was followed by some significant population losses, particularly the [plague of Justinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian). Under the weak Byzantine government, the cities and agricultural areas lost ground to nomads from the interior, which will have diminished the Mediterranean-wide population of the coasts relative to the more heavily Berber population of the interior.

Given the very long history of the region (it’s 50–60 generations back to the fall of the Vandal kingdom!) it’s very unlikely that a particular family would remain “Vandal” for that whole time. You could certainly take a home DNA test which might help spot a more recent influence — say, a European settler in the early 20th century or a Circassian soldier in Ottoman Tunis. However it’s more likely you’d get an answer which reflects the very complex mosaic of North African genetics — for a typical Tunisian, say, about 5% of their ancestry includes a European genetic signature, about 4% is Arab, maybe 2% is African, and the rest is Berber. But we know those bald percentages include an incredible history — Punic , Iberian, Roman, African, Vandal, Arab, Turkish, French and Italian all get collapsed into some fairly coarse numbers.



*The actual Vandal homeland is much debated, though the most popular hypothesis has them originating in Scandinavia and living in what’s now Poland during the late Roman period.
