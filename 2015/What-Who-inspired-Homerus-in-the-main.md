There's a lot of debate about whether [Homer](http://www.biography.com/people/homer-9342775) ever existed as a distinct individual -- it's been a controversial topic ever since antiquity. Nowadays we tend to limit discussions of Homer to the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey,_ but in antiquity there were a lot of other works, such as the so-called [Homeric Hymns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Hymns) also attributed to him. But the range of works attributed to "Homer" in antiquity is hugely broad and varies widely in quality; its clear that lots of stuff was tagged 'Homeric' for what amount to marketing reasons. This complicates any effort to understand Homer as an individual.

Homer -- if he lived at all -- would have lived several centuries before the appearance of alphabetic writing in Greece. If he really lived close to the time of historical fall of Troy (see [Why do archaeologists think that the Trojan War happened?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-archeologists-think-that-the-Trojan-War-happened)) then he would might, just possibly, have written in [Linear B](http://Linear B) -- but the nature and structure of the poetry makes it much, much more likely that the Iliad and Odyssey emerged during the [Greek Dark Age](http://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Dark_Age/) and were preserved by oral repetition. In classical times Herodotus put Homer's birth around what we'd label 850 BC -- midway between himself and the date that modern archaeologists assign to the fall of Troy. The poems as we have them were first written down some time in the 6th or 7th century BC and Greek scholars in antiquity collected and edited a huge range of different versions. Our usual editions today derive from a comprehensive edition created in the Library of Alexandria during the Ptolemaic period, but fragments of many others exist as well: you could create quite a different Iliad by choosing variants that various editors down the centuries have rejected or tweaked. So again, it's hard to spot the pure core of "Homer" in the works as we have them today.

_This Byzantine manuscript is between 1200 and 1800 years younger than "Homer"_ 

There are a lot of theories about Homer, but basically there are two big camps. 

Believers in the existence of an original Homer believe that the consistent voice, the high literary quality, and the overall vision of the two poems must be the product of a single mind -- although there's no agreement on exactly who the poet was, or where he lived. Most people believe that he was a Greek -- but it's been suggested he was actually a Trojan, or at least represented the Trojan side of affairs from some authentic non-Greek tradition ("Homeros", in Greek, can be a proper name: Ὅμηρος , but if written Ὅ μηρος it becomes "the portion" or "the piece of loot" -- so there's a view that the original author was in fact a Trojan POW. Given the dating issues mentioned above this is unlikely -- but it's a cool thought). Others have identified him with a travelling bard, not unlike the travelling bards of much later France or Ireland, who earned his living by wandering from one aristocratic household to another reciting poems -- that, they think, accounts for the long (and tedious) catalogs of names and places in the Iliad particularly, which function as shout-outs to different audiences or flattery to different noble families with real or pretended links to the Homeric heroes). Related to this, some people see him as a lone literary genius -- a disillusioned intellectual who made a living by telling traditional stories but recast them in a challenging, humanistic way that balanced out the adventure elements with literary insights.

On the other hand are people who don't believe there ever was a single Homer -- they think the poems we have today are a collection of disparate shorter tales that evolved into an anonymous, ever-changing repertoire of stories that morphed and changed to suit different times and places. In this view the best literary parts were improvised by one or another of the many travelling poets who recited the poems around the Greek world -- the best lines and imagery stuck around as different poets borrowed and repeated each other's most successful 'bits'. This is supposed to account both for the differences in tone between Iliad and Odyssey (this camps thinks they are only assigned to the same person because it was easier to talk about one person -- but both works are just as traditional and impersonal as "London Bridge is Falling Down" or "Hansel and Gretel".

My favorite book on the subject these days is not a scholarly one (which tend to be pretty dry) but rather Adam Nicholson's [Why Homer Matters](http://amzn.to/1NK792C).

To the extent you can say the maybe-there-was-one, maybe-there-wasn't "Homer" had an inspiration, it's definitely the entire world of the Late Bronze Age: a time dominated by adventurous, vainglorious warrior-aristocrats of exactly the type who populate the Iliad and Odyssey. 

 Unlike the city-state citizens of Classical Greece, or the numerous subjects of earlier Bronze Age empires, these guys lived in an atmosphere that was highly competitive, very brutal, and obsessed with martial glory -- the closest analogy in later times might be the pirates in the 16th century, or perhaps a modern drug gang. Their world was focused on relentless competition and conflict -- which tended to favor the bold and the daring. 

 Competition extended to everything: Bronze Age "heroes" were not merely power mad, they were also vain:this world shows a huge upsurge in the use of jewelry and cosmetics; it's also the period when the Olympic games -- a celebration of individual prowess -- became traditional. However this world was also unstable and dangerous, which inclined people towards fatalism and melancholy: not a lot of Bronze-age warlords died peacefully in their beds. This violent, unstable, but also compelling world is the background of "Homer's" view of life.
