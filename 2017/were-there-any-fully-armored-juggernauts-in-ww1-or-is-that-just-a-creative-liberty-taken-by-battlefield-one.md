# Were there any fully armored juggernauts in WW1, or is that just a creative liberty taken by Battlefield One?

“Totally made up” is not exactly fair, but it’s a better one-phrase description than anything else.

There are a couple of nods to period detail in the design: WWI militaries were painfully aware of the difficulties of trench warfare and they experimented with both body armor and automatic weapons.

Body armor proved to be impractical — with the materials available it was too heavy and cumbersome. As for hand-held automatic weapons, there were a small number of them but they were not widespread or reliable. The ones that made it into production were generally too heavy to use on the run: like the WWWII era the Browning Automatic Rifle — they were typically used as in-place light machine guns, not Rambo style.
