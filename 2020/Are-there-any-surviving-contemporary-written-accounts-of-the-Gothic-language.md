There are only a handful of Gothic primary texts.

The “Runic” alphabet — more properly [Elder Futhark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Futhark) — goes back as far as the second century or so. There’s not a lot of Gothic Futhark, however — the Goths switched to their own Greek-derived alphabet around the fourth century; most runic texts are from farther north and west. However the [ring of Pietroassa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Pietroassa), a gold ring from modern Romania, includes a Futhark inscription in Gothic — unfortunately one that’s pretty laconic and scholars disagree about how to read it, particularly since a thief damaged in in the 1870s.

_the ring of Pietroassa inscrption._ 

There are a few other similar runic inscriptions but they are often so short that it’s unclear if they are Gothic or another Germanic language.

The most famous and extensive texts are the fragments of the Gothic translation of the Bible, tradtionally ascribed to [Ulfilas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulfilas). The most complete piece is the [Codex Argenteus,](https://ub.uu.se/about-the-library/exhibitions/codex-argenteus/) a rendition of the Gothic text of the New Testament done in Italy in the sixth century for the Ostrogothic court.

There are few other texts from the sixth through the eighth centuries, mostly bible fragments. One of the few non-biblical examples is the so-called “[Skeireins](http://www.gotica.de/skeireins/)” or “Explanation”, a fragmentary commentary on the gospel of John in Gothic, probably a translation of a Greek work.

There are only a few surviving bits of “secular” Gothic:[ a sixth century property deed from Naples](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Naples_Deed.jpg) , another from Arrezzo, and a little bit of a (lliturgical) calendar which includes the oldest written mention of the word “Yule”.

There are also a handful of linguistic clues hidden in the [Getica](https://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html) — a not-particularly-reliable work on Gothic history done in the sixth century by the Romanized Gothic writer [Jordanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordanes). These have to be used cautiously.

Overall the Gothic corpus is pretty slender: less than 75,000 words overall. There’s a good rundown at [the Wulfila project website](http://www.wulfila.be/gothic/browse/).
