It’s “the well-being of the people is the highest law”. _Salus_ can mean “health”, “safety”, “security” or “well-being.”

The original quote is from Cicero’s book[ De Legibus, “On the Laws” (3.3.8](https://topostext.org/work/752)), where it is actually _Salus populi suprema lex esto, “Let the well being of the people be the highest law.”_
