The Greeks generally acknowledged that they got their letter forms from Phoenicia, which is quite easy to see in character-by-character comparisons although the Greek characters are frequently rotated compared to the Phoenician originals.

As time went on the sound and the form of the letters were changed. At this time the Greeks who were settled around them were for the most part Ionians, and after being taught the letters by the Phoenicians, they used them with a few changes of form. In so doing, they gave to these characters the name of 
_Phoenician._ 
I have myself seen Cadmean writing in the temple of Ismenian Apollo at Boeotian Thebes engraved on certain tripods and for the most part looking like Ionian letters.

So no, Linear B didn't really drive the forms of the Greek alphabet -- even though Linear B encoded the spoken Greek language.
