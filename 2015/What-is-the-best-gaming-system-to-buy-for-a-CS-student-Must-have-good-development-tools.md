As other answers note, there is no easy or obvious route direct to console development: devkits are expensive and usually come with a lot of legal strings attached, although the have been discussions of making Xbox development easier: [Report: Xbox One retail consoles to become dev kits this year, apps available to all devs](http://www.polygon.com/2015/2/17/8051525/xbox-one-dev-kit-retail-app-development-universal)

If the primary interest is in the hardcore programming side, learning how to program C++ with DirectX or OpenGL on the PC covers most of the same ground. Although there are always some platform specific optimizations on any console the main lines of this generation are a lot closer to PC development than they used to be.

If the primary interest is just in getting into development for hobby or game-design reasons, then Unity (link in the other answers) is a good choice: it's cross platform so you can develop on PC and, if you score an indie smash, the port to Xbox or PS (or even Wii U) will be much less painful than it will be for a roll-your-own game. On the other hand the performance of a Unity game will be less than it would be for a hand-coded C++ engine: for some kinds of games that may matter a lot, but for many genres it might never be noticeable to players. 

If the son really wants to be able to show off games on a TV with controllers for friends, there is also the [OUYA](https://www.ouya.tv/) console, which is basically an android tablet reworked into a console. Unlike the big kids, it's affordable ($99 bucks). You can develop for it with Unity or one of several[ other commercial engines](https://www.ouya.tv/developer-kit/). OUYA is not a great platform if you're looking to make quick fortune --they've had trouble getting market traction -- but the barrier to entry is very low.
