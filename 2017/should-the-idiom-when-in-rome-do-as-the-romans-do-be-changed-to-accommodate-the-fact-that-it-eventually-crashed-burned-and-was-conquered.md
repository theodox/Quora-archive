# Should the idiom "when in Rome, do as the Romans do" be changed to accommodate the fact that it eventually crashed, burned and was conquered?

Well, the Romans did OK for themselves, clocking in at a very respectable 2,206 years. You might want to check back in on this question in, say, the year 3,000 to see how our current arrangements are doing.

More than that, the point of it idiom isn’t ‘imitate Romans’, it’s ‘observe local customs wherever you go’. The original is _si fueris Romae, Romano vivito more; si fueris alibi, vivito sicut ibi_ “should you be at Rome, live in the Roman fashion; if you’re somewhere else, live as it’s done there” — which seems a generally sensible bit of advice.
