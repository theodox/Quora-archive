Generally a _developer_  is an over-arching term for everybody who contributes materially to the creation of a game — artists, programmers, audio folks, designers, and testers. Sometimes it’s used to mean anybody on a game team, while other people restrict it only to people who contribute directly to the software (ie, artists and programmers but not accountants or HR people).

A game _programmer_ actually writes code — they use the same kinds of programming tools as other computer programmers to make the game function. Some programmers take an active hand in what players see and hear — the way an AI is implemented, for example, will have a big impact in the way the game feels. On the other hand other programmers are solving technical problems that gamers never know about.

Some game _designers_ also write code, but their real responsibility is crafting the player experience. Some designers do things like create characters and stories, others manage things like in-game economies or the balance of different weapons. “Level designers” are responsible for the physical layout of game spaces.
