# Why do we "latinize" names like Copernicus (Copernik), Columbus (Colombo) and Linnaeus (Linné)? Why not just use their actual birth names?

Although there are exceptions, the habit tends to coincide with the heyday of Latin as an international language of secular scholarship, so roughly from 1450 to 1750. During this period a Swedish biologist like Linnaeus, a Dutch lawyer like [Grotius](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/grotius/), a Flemish anatomist like [Vesalius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Vesalius) and an Italian printer like [Manutius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Manutius) would all Latinize their names because they were communicating to an international audience using Latin as their primary medium. Essentially, using a Latin name helped to proclaim your status as a member of the international “republic of letters”

Also, using a Latin name got you off the hook for the vagaries of early modern orthography. Somebody in, say, Madrid who got their hands on Grotius’ _De iure belli ac pacis,_ would have a hard time figuring out how to say “Hugo de Groot”. Most European countries were still stabilizing their written languages during this period so the usual issues of cross-language transliteration were even worse that you’d expect. At various times Copernicus was Niclas Koppernigk, Nicolaus Nicolai de Torunia, Nicolaus Kopperlingk de Thorn, and Nicolaus Copernik. “Copernicus” was both a favor to readers and a good piece of branding without reference to the vagaries of German-Polish nomenclature in the Holy Roman Empire.

Generally anybody you’ve ever heard of between the years around 1450–1750 was known outside their home country by a Latinized monicker. The most famous ones were often re-nativized retrospectively in the age of nationalism so the man whom contemporaries knew as _Renatus Cartesius_  became retroactively “Rene Descartes” once claiming him for the glory of French culture was important. That’s one of the reasons why many of the surviving Latin names come from countries which were less successful in the nation-building games of the 18th and 19th centuries — Copernicus would have had a hard time deciding how he actually fits into the modern split between “Poland” and “Germany,” neither of which existed in its modern form when he was Nicolaus Kopperlingk de Thorn.
