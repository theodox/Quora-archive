I suspect somebody means “psychedelic,” rather than psychotic.

Cuphead is an homage to the era fondly known as [Rubber Hose Animation](http://rubberhoseanimation.tumblr.com/) - the style that was prevalent in American animation from the 20’s through the mid 30’s, when it was eclipsed by more realistic styles (particularly after Disney’s [Snow White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(1937_film)#Original_theatrical_run) debuted in 1937). The game’s wonderful weirdness comes straight out of the anarchic sense of humor of the early animation industry. There is nothing as fun as trying out a brand new medium, and the complete insanity of a lot of those early shorts makes much modern stuff look very by-the-numbers.

The Rubber Hose style was pioneered by people who started in newspaper comic strips. They were familiar with very graphic, non-realist styles of illustration (among other things, the low quality of a lot of newsprint in the 20’s discouraged artists from really pushing fine details or shading). They were also discovering that animation required a lot more artwork than producing newspaper strips. In response, they created styles and characters which were very simple and efficient to draw. Circles and ellipses were the basic building blocks, because these were a lot easier to move around without obvious distortions.

These were tricks familiar to newspaper artists already, since in those days it was pretty common for a popular strip to run 5, 6 or 7 times a week.

Other limitations of the early medium tended to push for a lot of exaggeration and stylization. The character’s limbs were usually very rubbery (hence the name ‘rubber hose’). The early animation were typically between 6 and 12 frames per second (a modern game is either 30 or 60). Angular shapes look very jerky at such low framerates. By exaggerating the movements — and adding a lot of graphic exaggerations like blur lines or exclamation points over their heads — the animators tried to hide the choppiness of the early films.



Over time this technique evolved into the classic the [squash and stretch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_and_stretch) that most animations still used to day — but it took a long time. Even early Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig shorts still use a lot of the rubber hose toolkit.

If you watch any Rubber Hose toons you’ll notice that they backgrounds tend to be very strongly separated from the foreground action. Unlike those foreground characters, the backgrounds could be pretty lavish and more painterly (this is held over into more familiar stuff, like Bugs Bunny as well). Luckily for Cuphead, this is a pretty natural style for a side-scroller in any case. Complex parallax didn’t really make it into cartoons until Disney’s [Multiplane Cameras](http://www.animationschooldaily.com/multiplane-cameras/) in the mid 30’s.



The earliest cartoons were silent, and the first sound cartoons had poor audio and synchronization problems — so sound effects and music had to be pretty unsubtle, and they were often telegraphed by graphics indicators in case the audience couldn’t hear well:



_Note the music notes and worry lines_ 

Until the later 30’s all cartoons were in black and white (the first color cartoon was Disney’s _Flowers and Trees_  in 1932) . The first five or six years of color cartoons tended to produce soft, watery look, which Cuphead captures very nicely with its shaders and the post-process which gives the whole game a strong film-grain effect. Here’s a couple of examples which give the feeling of the color. You’ll see a lot of this in Cuphead.





There’s a nice history of the Rubber Hose era [here](http://the-animatorium.blogspot.com/2013/06/spaghetti-limbs-bouncy-movement-age-of.html). And this is a GDC presentation by one of the Cuphead team discussing how they came up with a lot of their designs.
