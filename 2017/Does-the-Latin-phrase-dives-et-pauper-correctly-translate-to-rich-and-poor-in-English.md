It’s literally “the rich [man] and the poor [man]”, with the nouns implied in the usual Latin fashion. “Rich and Poor” in English is a throwback phrase which uses the same tactic, since to use it in a sentence we have to turn the adjectives into nouns. We don’t do that as much in modern usage as we once did, but it’s around in lots of old phrases like “young and old alike.”

In Medieval Latin — it’s a rhetorical phrase contrasting the wealthy (and morally suspect) with the meek (who will inherit the earth); it crops up in a lot of homiletic contexts;

_Tempus adhuc veniet, quo dives, qui modo gaudet,
Assidue flebit, dum pauper grata videbit._ 

The time comes apace, when the rich man, who now rejoices
will weep bitterly, while the poor man shall see grace
