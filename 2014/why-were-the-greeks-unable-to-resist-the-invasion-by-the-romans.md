The Roman involvement with the Greek world lasted a very long time, and the 'conquest' of the Greek world was a very sporadic process spread out over several centuries which proceeded in fits and starts with setbacks and changes of momentum. For this reason any answer has to be pretty vague. There are, however, several themes that are pretty consistent:

__Greece was not united__ . The geographical area of modern Greece was a patchwork of kingdoms, city-states and alliance groupings which was not united by a strong, universally acknowledged government. The most powerful single force in mainland Greek politics as the Macedonian kingdom, which after Alexander was the biggest power in Hellas but frequently faced opposition, rebellion and very grudging cooperation from the older powers (Athens, Sparta, Thebes, Corinth) and newer groups (The Aetolian League and the Achaean League). Macedonian domination was never popular -- the final Roman settlement of Greece was regarded as an improvement by many, particularly local elites who preferred the fairly hands-off rule of Rome to the detailed interference of Macedonians.

Outside of mainland Greece, the situation was much the same: after Alexander died, the Greek world split into warring groups led by Alexander's former generals. The 3 main factions - Macedonia proper, the Seleucid kingdom of Syria, and the Ptolemaic kingdom of Egypt - were constantly intriguing against and fighting each other. None of them was strong enough to rule without local proxies, so there were a host of smaller states and cities which played the big kingdoms off against each other, creating a very unstable pattern of temporary alliances and betrayals (another reason why mainland Greece didn't like the Macedonians was a lot of money coming from the Ptolemies to support anti-Macedonian factions).

Related to the first answer is the fact the __Greek militaries relied heavily on mercenaries.__ In the spates of dynastic warfare between the successor kingdoms mercenaries made sense as an alternative to conscription, since the successor kingdoms weren't deeply rooted among their subject populations: Syria and Egypt were colonial societies dominated by a small Greek elite ruling a larger native population who didn't have deep affection for their rulers, while Macedonia ruled over restless Greeks who resented their control. Rome, on the other hand, drew its soldiers from the large and relatively well-off Italian hinterland. They were more committed and less likely to be bought off than mercenaries, but due to their long service they were still very skillful soldiers. 

In the early years of Greek-Roman conflicts, the Greek powers did have technical and tactical advantages - better ships, advanced weaponry, more diverse tactics (elephants, archers, slingers and light troops among others -- the Romans tended to stick with medium infantry and cavalry). However the Romans usually had more strategic patience: they remained committed to their objectives and were less likely to be distracted by factionalism or disputed successions among the royal families. They could outlast enemies they could not always outfight.


Finally, __Rome had a strategic free hand__ . After the defeat of Carthage in the second Punic war (201 BC) , Rome had no enemies of equal stature to the west. All of the Greek powers, on the other hand, had powerful and untrustworthy neighbors with advanced militaries -- not just the other Greek states but also the Parthians and the Kingdom of Pontus as well. This made it harder for them to defend against any single threat.

_After the second Punic war the Carthaginians(red) were not militarily significant. The Ptolemies (green) Seluecids (yellow) Macedonians (blue) were all bitter rivals who never cooperated_ 

All of that said, the "conquest" of "Greece" -- that is, the eventual Roman absorption of the Greek world - took a long time: the first major conflict was the Pyrrhic war in 280 BC (where an advanced Greek army beat the Romans but at a terrible cost - the origin of our phrase "Pyrrhic victory"). The last embers of Greek independence were stamped out by Sulla in 88 BC, while Ptolemaic Egypt succumbed to Augustus in 30 BC. So it's not as if the Romans just rolled over a completely helpless foe.
