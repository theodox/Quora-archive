The Coptic language, used in Coptic services, is the last spoken version of the language of the pyramid builders. Knowledge of Coptic was what made [decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics](http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/hiero3.htm) possible. 

Copts are theologically [monophysites](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389961/monophysite), recognizing only "one nature" (_physis)_ in Jesus: he is understood as being indistinguishable from God the Father, where in Greek Orthodox and Catholic theology Jesus is both God and Man. 

Today this is a very abstruse and subtle distinction that few people would argue about, but in the 5th and 6th centuries this was the focus of a very intense conflict. Modern scholars disagree about how much of this was really driven by theology and how much by covert nationalism, since the various Monophysite churches (Syriac, Armenian, and Ethiopian as well as Coptic) were all centered in non-Greek-speaking language communities. But the effect was clear: Coptic Churches have strong historic links with other Monophysite churches, but their relations with Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant churches were pretty distant until modern times.
