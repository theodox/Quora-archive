# Should I continue learning C# or go to C++ as first language (planning to make games for personal use)? It doesn't matter if there is a game engine for either, if I need I make from scratch to learn.

If you’re a first-time programmer, C# is a lot easier to learn.

Cars are a good analogy: you want to learn to drive on an automatic transmission (C#, with automatic memory management and more predictable compilation chain), not a manual transmission (C++ with all of its low-level optimization features, but also its “undefined behaviors” and implementation-specific variations). The theoretical performance of C++ is better, no question; in your first few projects you are unlikely to be able to realize that theoretical maximum very well. C++ programmers will tell you C++ is a Porsche to C#’s Honda Civic — but you really don’t want your _first_ car to be a Porsche.

Once you’re familiar with development in general you’ll be in a better position to appreciate how C++ differs and what it can do for you. But for your first game, it’s adding a world of extra work and hassle.
