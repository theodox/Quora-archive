Somewhere on the Jhelum river, but nobody really knows where. The changing river courses have erased the site of the original battle, probably several times, in the intervening centuries. If we ever find the site it will be an extraordinarily lucky break. It’s probably somewhere along the line of what used to be called the Grand Trunk Road — but there’s no guarantee the river is anywhere near the site today.
