Yes and no.

There was no constitution in the modern sense, and no formal legal protection around speech. On the other hand there were few if any speech codes either: the main danger to the outspoken individual was other individuals. The Roman state had, by modern standards, very little formal power: there was no permanent police force, no professional judiciary, and no arm of the state devoted to promoting an official ideology — so, in the purely legal or bureaucratic sense limits on freedom of expression were pretty soft.

The most common “speech criminals” were not political critics but religious outliers, fortune-tellers and would-be prophets. In periods of political tension, the Roman establishment saw anything which might frighten (or motivate) the populace at large as a possible threat. This was particularly true in the case of religious groups which met in private: while there was no clear legal prohibition on speech for content reasons, the Romans definitely did not believe in freedom of assembly! Only licensed associations were allowed to have regular private meetings of any kind. The general flavor can be gleaned from Livy’s description of the policy which the Senate adopted to suppress the cult of Bacchus in 187 BC:

> How often, in the times of our fathers and our grandfathers, has the task been assigned to the magistrates of forbidding the introduction of foreign cults, of excluding dabblers in sacrifices and fortune-tellers from the Forum, the Circus, and the City, of searching out and burning books of prophecies, and of annulling every system of sacrifice except that performed in the Roman way.

The result of this attitude was the periodic suppression of various forms of religious expression that seemed suspicious or clandestine. As Livy’s quote makes clear fortune-tellers, astrologers, and unlicensed augurs were rounded up and expelled from the city (or punished more harshly) when the authorities were feeling nervous.

On the other hand, out-and-out political speech was generally less subject to government interference. Rome had several periods of robust democracy, when challenges to the existing political order were open and forcibly expressed: the most famous is the [Conflict of the Orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_the_Orders), the two hundred years of intermittent political strife which broke the monopoly of the nobility on political power. During this period there was plenty of popular agitation against the powerful, but there was no clear legal mechanism that the state could use to prohibit efforts to advocate for change — particularly after the creation of the [tribunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribune_of_the_Plebs) in 493 BC which created a powerful office that was intended to protect popular liberty.

Over the life of the Republic there were several cases where political speech was suppressed by violence. The most infamous case was the murder of the reformer [Tiberius Gracchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Gracchus) by the leaders of the Senate. However it’s noteworthy that even in that crisis. the killing was not done legally or by the Roman state — it was essentially aristocratic mob violence. Despite — or perhaps because of — a long his history of contentious politics the republican state never created the legal tools to formally censor political speech.

All of this changed drastically, it should be said, after the end of the Republic: the empire, even under the more genteel Caesars, was an authoritarian state with an unaccountable security force. Augustus began the practice of prosecuting libel (at least, “libel” against himself and his government) as _maiestas_ , that is, as treason: a precedent which would last down to the end of the empire. The first case of the Roman government acting to suppress purely political literature was the burning of the works of [Titus Labienus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Labienus_(historian)), at the order of Augustus, in 6 AD.
