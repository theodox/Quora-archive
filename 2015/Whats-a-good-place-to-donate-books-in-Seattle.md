[Friends of the Seattle Public library](http://www.friendsofspl.org/donate-books/) is an easy choice. Last time I did it they were giving receipts but that was a while back.. In a pinch the Goodwill in Ballard takes books and gives tax receipts.

Of course the really _Seattle_  way is to make one of those little public library boxes and put them out on the street: [Seattle Little Free Libraries](https://www.facebook.com/SeattleLittleFreeLibraries/).
