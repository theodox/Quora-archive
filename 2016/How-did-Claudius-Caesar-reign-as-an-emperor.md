While I think [Eleftherios Tserkezis](https://www.quora.com/profile/Eleftherios-Tserkezis) gives a good review of the standard ‘revisionist Claudius’ — which is a useful counterpart very unfavorable views in the sources — I think there’s a different way to read this period.

Fundamentally Claudius _didn’t really rule the empire_ . In most important respects he was a placeholder: a figurehead with the right bloodline and not much else. He seems to have to tried in his own idiosyncratic way to do a good job — but he was only a cipher in the real politics of his own empire.

Here’s how Claudius got the throne:

The front side of the coin is Claudius; on the back (literally behind the emperor) is the _Castra Praetoria:_ the camp of the Praetorian guards. In the center a somewhat awkward figure holds a general’s baton over the legend IMPER.RECEPT, for _imperium receptum:_ 
“command is received”

The story in Suetonius goes like this:

> When the assassins of [Caligula] shut out the crowd under pretense that the emperor wished to be alone, Claudius was ousted with the rest …. a little later, in great terror at the news of the murder, he stole away to a balcony hard by and hid among the curtains which hung before the door. As he cowered there, a common soldier, who was prowling about at random, saw his feet, intending to ask who he was, pulled him out and recognized him; and when Claudius fell at his feet in terror, he hailed him as emperor. Then he took him to the rest of his comrades… These placed him in a litter, took turns in carrying it, since his own bearers had made off, and bore him to the [Praetorian] Camp in a state of despair and terror, while the throng that met him pitied him, as an innocent man who was being hurried off to execution.

> Received within the rampart he spent the night among the sentries with much less hope than confidence; for the consuls with the senate and the city cohorts had taken possession of the Forum and the Capitol… But the next day, since the senate was dilatory in putting through its plans because of the tiresome bickering of those who held divergent views, while the populace, who stood about the hall, called for one ruler and expressly named Claudius. __He allowed the armed assembly of the soldiers to swear allegiance to him, and promised each man fifteen thousand sesterces; being the first of the Caesars who resorted to bribery to secure the fidelity of the troops.__ 

[Suetonius, Life of Claudius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html), 10 ff.

Although Claudius later claimed that he had exaggerated his health problems to survive the treacherous court of Caligula, he was always dogged his personal awkwardness and his failure to live up to the traditional manly image of a Roman aristocrat. However he had the Praetorians: the only significant armed force in the capitol. His lack of charisma or powerful institutional backers meant that he remained dependent on his Praetorians throughout his tenure — which made him the perfect emperor from their point of view.

The Praetorians had been a significant force in palace politics since [Sejanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejanus) had unleashed his reign of terror under Tiberius; but with their crowning of Claudius their ascendancy had become nearly complete. Claudius needed them, too. During his 13 year reign there were six distinct plots against him. 35 senators and 300 equites were executed in connection with these various plots. Several sources indicate that Claudius lived in terror of assassination — a logical enough attitude for a survivor in the Julio-Claudian family — and it’s more than likely some of these ‘plots’ were catspaws in the complex game of court maneuvering rather than serious threats to the throne: a scared emperor is easier to manipulate.

Claudius’ one major military venture, the invasion of Britain, bears the hallmarks of a trophy-hunting expedition. Britain wasn’t necessarily a vital military target**: the Romans had toyed with the idea since Julius Caesar’s first invasion in 55 BC but never committed seriously to any of the several projects that had been mooted since then (including one by Caligula, only 3 years before Claudius made his invasion). The most important thing Britain had to offer was a fairly easy target with which a shaky throne could look a bit more impressive (and which would let Claudius claim some of the lustre of his Julian ancestry). That’s why the emperor ‘commanded’ the campaign for a few weeks after the main fighting was done: enough to decently collect his triumph and to return home.

__Silver__ 

However the Praetorian’s didn’t care much for the day-to-day business of the empire. They did feel responsible for imperial defense* — in this era they were still soldiers and not yet a completely politicized paramilitary force — but the actual governance was left mostly to another powerful group: the _familia Caesaris,_ the collection of imperial slaves and freedmen who were the functional equivalent of a permanent civil service. From an improvisational beginning under Augustus this group had become large, powerful — and (despite its lowly social origins) extremely wealthy: Claudius’ freedman [Narcissus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Claudius_Narcissus), who was effectively the imperial secretary of state, was said to be wealthier by far than Crassus, the richest man in the old Republic.

Claudius — who was by most accounts prone to indecision — was the center of a whirlwind of influence-peddling among both the _familia_ and the imperial family_._ It’s _probably_  not true that empress Messalina had an affair with the freedman [Polybius,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_(freedman)) and it’s _probably_  not true that empress [Agrippina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippina_the_Younger) had an affair with the freedman [Pallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallas_(freedman)) — but it’s certainly significant that those kinds of stories defined Claudius’ tenure. Claudius was frequently portrayed as being the pawn of his wives — which might reflect his personality or might simply reflect the most outwardly visible aspect of the court struggles which surrounded him. His reputation for erratic and contradictory decisions stems from the fact that he was in a weak position surrounded with powerful, ambitious factions that vied for influence and money.

Looked at this way several of the signature achievements of this period look rather different. His huge public works projects — the harbor at [Ostia](http://www.archaeology.org/issues/168-1503/features/2971-rome-portus-rise-of-empire), the extension of the Aqua Claudia, and above all the failed attempt to drain the [Fucine Lake](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fucine_Lake) all offered tremendous opportunities for profiteering; later writers explicitly blamed the disaster at the Lake (which nearly killed the emperor and many of the spectators) on Narcissus’ pocketing the funds. His games and grain distributions were standard tools in currying favor with the populace — but also precisely the kind of big outlays that offered the greatest opportunities for peculation.

_The Aqua Claudia - a useful project but also a great opportunity for graft._ 

__His own man__ 

Claudius was not politically powerful: the populace was loyal to his name, not to him; the Praetorians were loyal to his silver; and the upper classes resented him either as an autocrat or simply as a stuttering fool.

All that said, he was still an emperor, albeit a somewhat idiosyncratic one. In areas that interested him —- and where other powerful interests were not dominant, he did leave a mark of his own.

He had very antiquarian tastes (Robert Graves, in _I, Claudius,_ made him out to be a closet Republican). He revived old institutions like the censorship; he was an avid patron of every traditional kind of Roman divination and augury. He was fond of long-winded, esoteric speeches which his audiences were obliged to endure politely. He seems to have enjoyed his role as a judge a bit too much, indulging in [the kinds of judicial which has become familiar on daytine TV](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#15):

> In a case involving citizenship a fruitless dispute arose among the advocates as to whether the defendant ought to make his appearance in the toga or in a Greek mantle, and the emperor, with the idea of showing absolute impartiality, made him change his garb several times, according as he was accused or defended.

He does seem to have take a deep personal interest in a few important topics. His romantic antiquarianism and his fascination with his Claudian ancestors led him to work personally and actively for the inclusion of Roman citizens from Gaul in the Senate: Tacitus [reproduces a speech](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/11B*.html#24) (peppered with archaisms) that seems to be the genuine Claudius and not unworthy:

> All, Conscript Fathers, that is now believed supremely old has been new: plebeian magistrates followed the patrician; Latin, the plebeian; magistrates from the other races of Italy, the Latin. Our innovation, too, will be parcel of the past, and what to‑day we defend by precedents will rank among precedents.

Much of the rest of the actions of his reign seem like the routine grinding of the bureaucratic machinery of empire, but this seems to reflect a man who wasn’t really raised to rule but found himself in a position beyond his capabilities, but where — at least once in awhile — he could do some good. As Augustus said of him “The poor fellow is unlucky; for in important matters, where his mind does not wander, the nobility of his character is apparent enough.”



Ultimately we’re dependent on 3 main sources: [Suetonius, Tacitus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html), and [Cassius Dio](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html) All write from a good remove in time, and from a more or less hostile point of view (either anti-Julio-Claudian or anti-imperial) So we have to accept some uncertainty. I tend to think that the failings of his position were more political than personal… but also that Dio still more or less had it right:

> though ruler of all the Romans and their subjects, had become himself a slave…. [His courtiers] seized upon this failing of his, too, to accomplish many of their purposes for by frightening him they could use him fully for their own ends



_* under Nero, for example the Praetorian prefect_ _[Burrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Afranius_Burrus)_ _helped guide foreign policy into sensible channels while Nero was still amenable to reason)._ 

_** Strabo’s Geography, written in the 20’s, includes a paragraph discussing why occupying Britain would cost more than it would raise in tribute and taxes. Clearly this had been debated in Rome for a while._
