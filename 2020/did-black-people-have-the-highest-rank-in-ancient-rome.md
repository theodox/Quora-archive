There were five emperors of North African ancestry:

[Septimius Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus), his sons [Caracalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla) and the short-lived [Geta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geta_(emperor)), [Macrinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus) and [Aemilianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aemilianus) . The closest modern ethnic analogy for all of these would be Berber or Amazigh.*

Whether that is “black” is an exercise for the reader. Here’s a family portrait of the first three, along with empress [Julia Domna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Domna) who was a Syrian.

*Aemilian was identified by contemporaries as a _Maurus_ , a “Moor”, but he was actually born in what’s now Tunisia).
