The Romans noted that warriors from Gaul, Germania and Britain all tended to be heavily tattooed — though the descriptions make it seem that the Romans themselves didn’t use tattoos to the same degree. The Latin name for the Scots, the _Pictii_ , means “the painted ones” and refers to their habit of fighting in body paint and/or tatoos — they seem to have take the practice to an extreme in the ancient world. The main ink was probably [woad](http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Isatis/), a blueish dye.

Late Roman soldiers got tattoos, at least thats how we read the 4th century military writer [Vegetius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/vegetius.html). This seems to have been the equivalent of the dog-tag, not warlike display: Vegetius talks about it as part of the induction process for new recruits. However we don’t know when the procedure started — it’s probably a late derivation from a period when the Roman legions included people from all over western and southeastern Europe. The soldier’s decoration was known as the _stigma -_ the root of our word, which gives you an idea of the general attitude towards tattoos — tattoos (and brands) were used to mark slaves and criminals as well as soldiers, so they were not something that members of the upper classes would voluntarily have worn.

Greeks don’t seem to have used tattoos to the same degree for any purpose. Herodotus says that Thracian and Scythian warriors used tattoos, but (like wearing pants) the Greeks regarded this as an outlandish practice.
