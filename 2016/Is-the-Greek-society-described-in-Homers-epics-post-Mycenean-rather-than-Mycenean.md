# Is the Greek society described in Homer's epics post-Mycenean rather than Mycenean?

Bracketing for our lack of direct evidence, it does seem that in general Homer’s _basileoi_  owe at least as much to the piratical chiefs of the Greek Dark Ages as they do to the _pa-si-re-oi_ of the height of Mycenaean prosperity.

Of course our understanding of this has to be conjectural since there is a long, unlettered period in between the Mycenaean peak (~ 1500–1200 BC) and our guesstimate date for “Homer” (~ 800).

__Economy__ 

The archaeological evidence for the Mycenaean period suggests that the palaces were centers of a centralized, bureaucratized society, reminiscent of the temple-states of the Near East; we have next to nothing of a literary nature in Linear B, but we have a remarkable amount of inventory management.

_Unlike Homer’s heroes, the real Mycenaeans were obsessive record-keepers_ 

Homer’s heroes would have approved of the obsessive cataloguing of wealth that the Mycenaeans loved, but there’s no evidence in Homer for bureaucratic infrastructure that made this life possible — the only mention of writing at all is at [Iliad VI.159](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D6%3Acard%3D156) where King Proteus contrives to have Bellerophon murdered by dispatching “baneful tokens: many deadly signs, graved in a folded tablet,” that is, a letter. The circumlocutions clearly make this seem like an illiterate era’s recollection of an age when writing was common.

__Politics__ 

We also have evidence from the Mycenaean period for international trade and treaties which bespeaks a much more integrated system of international relations than the “everyone’s a pirate out of sight of home” ethos of the Iliad and the Odyssey. At least, if we’re correct in the way we read the [letter from the Hittite king Hattusilis to the ‘King of the Ahhiwaya’](http://archive.archaeology.org/0405/etc/troy3.html) it seems like the Mycenaeans were regular participants in the complex international world of the late Bronze age. We also see evidence of trade (Egyptian artifacts in Pylos, for example, and Mycenean artifacts in the Levant and Egypt).

_The real Mycenaeans traded and did diplomacy with a number of foreign powers: Homer’s heroes are more like a pirate fleet_ 

Little of this shows up in Homer. There’s some kind of coalition among the Greek cities, with Agamemnon playing a role as high king that has no clear analogue in later Greek history which may reflect some Bronze Age reality. The world outside the conflict between the Greeks and Trojans, though, is mostly mythologized: Egypt and Phoenicia are known, but the line between their day-to-day reality and myth is very blurry. Cretans figure prominently — [Idomeneus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idomeneus) for example is a major character in the Iliad — but Homer is clearly fuzzy on the politics and ethnic nature of the island. He records a bunch of traditions in which Cretans invent the arts of civilization: King Minos is depicted as a lawgiver and a civilizer — but he doesn’t mention what archaeology tells us: that the Minoan civilization was conquered by Mycenaeans some time in the two or three centuries prior to the putative date (~ 1200 BC) of the Trojan War. All of which suggests that the Greece Homer is recalling is one which is much less well integrated with the rest of the eastern Mediterranean.

It’s also hard to square the rough and ready domestic politics depicted in Homer with the palace-centric lifestyle depicted in the archeological sources. The centralized, bureaucratic state we see in the Linear B tablets does not seem like the kind of place where a common soldier like [Thersites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thersites) would ever have gotten an opportunity to upbraid a high king like Agamemnon in public

__War__ 

For a long time we’ve assumed that Mycenaean warfare resembled that described by Homer. Homer accurately preserves some details of equipment (most notably, the use of chariots which were long gone in ‘contemporary’ 9th century BC Greece but are everywhere in the epics) and so we’ve usually assumed that the undisciplined, ‘heroic’ style of warfare and the free-booting lifestyle of the poems is Mycenaean. [Some recent scholarship](https://books.google.com/books?id=EoLG7QNTPoEC&lpg=PR5&ots=To_kB7f9u0&dq=late%20helladic%20piracy&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false) disagrees, seeing the Mycenaeans as a more more sophisticated players in the great-power politics of their day with a more professional military and a deeper integration into the complex diplomatic world of the late Bronze age.

In this view the Viking-like tendencies of Homer’s heroes reflect the chaos that follows [Bronze Age Collapse](https://www.quora.com/What-caused-the-Bronze-Age-Collapse), where the descendants of the prosperous and urbane Mycenaeans degenerated into pirates and bandit chiefs to survive in straitened circumstances. It’s worth noting that Homer’s heroes sack Troy and return home, where the historic Mycenaean who conquered [Knossos](http://www.ancient.eu/knossos/) , for example, stayed around and ruled in place of the dynasty they overthrew.

_Homer did recall details of Mycenaean kit, like the horned helmets and greaves; but his fighters don’t display the disciplined heavy-infantry tactics that are implied by Mycenaean art like the Warrior Vase_ 

It’s also worth pointing out that the Mycenaeans used equipment - heavy armor and large shields - which in later times was associated with disciplined phalanx-style tactics and not with the free-for-all heroics we see in the poems.

__TLDR__ 

“Homer” is “writing” — that is, the oral tradition of the Iliad and the Odyssey settled into a stable form — about 400 years after the collapse of Mycenaean civilization. The poems definitely preserve a lot of authentic nuggets of Mycenaean information: the old view that they were purely invented didn’t survive Schliemann’s discoveries at Troy and Mycenae. Oral traditions, though, are not great at preserving the kind of complex information we wish we had about the past: they capture striking and evocative fragments but the context is muddied by the vagaries of transmission and the needs of art.

As far as we can tell the oral tradition is rooted in memories of Mycenaean realities but heavily filtered by the heroic, anarchic society of the Greek Dark ages: it’s the Greek equivalent of one one those medieval retellings of the story of Alexander in which the Macedonian conqueror rides about in plate armor and a padded jupon.
