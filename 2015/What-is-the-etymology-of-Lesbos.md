My guess would be a Pelasgian original that was Greek-ified. The legendary derivation is a [Lapith ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapithes_(hero))hero who married into the family of [Macareus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macareus_(son_of_Helios)), which might (?) represent a connection with historic Rhodes. The name already shows up as _Lazba_  in Hittite records, so it is an old name, and it doesn't have an obvious Greek etymology. 

Another good guess might be a word in [Lemnian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemnian_language), which unfortunately we don't know very well.
