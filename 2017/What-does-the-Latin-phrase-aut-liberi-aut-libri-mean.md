Literally it’s “either children or books”; figuratively, it’s the choice between domestic life and “the life of the mind.”

I can’t find an actual citation before the 19th century, which makes sense: Roman fathers, at least, were not likely to be much inconvenienced by domestic chores so it would not have seems like a choice to them. It might make sense in a medieval monastic context, but I suspect it’s a schoolboy pun.

It shows up in both Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, both of whom were fairly fluent in Latin, and neither of whom was much for domesticity.
