Like [Spencer McDaniel](https://www.quora.com/profile/Spencer-McDaniel-11)’s my answer is perhaps _exactly_  what one would expect.

> Not that there always were corresponding places. Hutcheson’s conception of marriage and divorce, for example, was Christian (though liberal and deistic, without reference to a sacrament) and significantly different from Greek and Roman..

The abrupt opening to the paragraph detracts from the flavor; the third sentence is

> And he could not have found an exact equivalent for the key word in his definition of “oeconomics,” which “treat of the rights and obligations in a famlly.”

From [The Ancient Economy](https://amzn.to/2EOscjY), by [Sir M.I. “Red Moses” Finley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Finley). He’s beginning his survey of ancient economies with Adam Smith’s Glasgow compatriot Frances Hutcheson in 1742, using Hutcheson to set his discussion of economics in an anthropological, rather than a statistical or mechanistic frame of reference.
