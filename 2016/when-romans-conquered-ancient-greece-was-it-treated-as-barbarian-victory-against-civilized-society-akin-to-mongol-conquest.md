There was not a single 'Roman conquest of Greece' - it was a long, drawn out process that lasted around 250 years. In none of this time did they ever face off a united Greek nation - in every one of the dozens of conflicts between Rome and different Greek powers, Rome always had Greek allies. Some Greek states -- particularly [Syracuse,](http://www.ancient.eu/syracuse/) [Pergamon ](http://www.ancient.eu/pergamon/)and [Rhodes ](http://www.ancient.eu/Rhodes/)-- were long-term Roman allies while others were persistent enemies.

In short, the Roman conquest of Greece was not an event - it was a long historical process that is only obvious in hindsight.

The secret of Roman success against Greek states wasn't that the Romans were more aggressive or even more militarily powerful than their rivals: it was that the Romans were more disciplined and more consistent in pursuit of their interests. Most Greek states were monarchies run by feuding families given to betrayal and palace intrigue; most Greek states were obsessed with their ancestral rivalries and were more than happy to involve the Romans in their schemes when they thought they could profit. The Romans tended to be more united at home and less given to sudden changes of policy, which gave them a critical edge as their power increased. Their reputation as (comparatively) reliable allies and (relatively) generous victors also made it easy for them to find allies.

The truth that Rome was the dominant power in the Mediterranean did not become obvious to the Greek world until the [Fourth Macedonian War ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Macedonian_War)in 150 BC. That war was not actually a serious military confrontation, but it ended with the Roman annexation of Macedonia as a province: the first permanent Roman 'conquest' in the Greek heartland. That set off a popular anti-Roman reaction in mainland Greece. The [Achaean League ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaean_League)-- hitherto a Roman ally -- declared a very ill-advised war on Rome. That culminated in the [brutal sack of Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Corinth_(146_BC)) in 146 BC, which was a terrible shock to the Greeks, demonstrating that the Romans could be just as ruthless as any 'barbarian' conqueror and that Greek cultural achievements were no guarantee of safety.

Polybius, the Greek historian who studied Rome more closely than any of his contemporaries, was uniquely placed to analyze the rise of Rome: he was both a Greek statesman and a 'guest' (that is, a hostage) of one Rome's leading families: he saw Rome's victory over Carthage and the destruction of Corinth at first hand.

_The last days of Corinth, as imagined in the 19th century_ 

Corinth was, however, an outlier: while Roman officials (particularly in the century between Corinth and Julius Caesar) were not above squeezing money out of their subjects, Roman rule on the whole was not too bad for the Greeks.

Since the Romans generally preferred to rule through local proxies, the affairs of most Greek communities were still in the hands of Greek elites. Roman rule provided a single, final court of appeals to resolve the endless squabbles which alway plagued Greek politics without resort to war. Roman control over Greek foreign affairs also put a useful damper on the endemic political conflicts among Greek factions: Greek kings had a habit of supporting their rivals abroad to annoy one another, which rendered Greek domestic politics very chaotic. So, despite some ineffectual support for [Mithridates of Pontus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus), Rome's last serious rival to the east, the Greek world generally submitted to Roman rule with more resignation than bitterness.

Romans had been operating in the Greek cultural orbit for centuries -- most educated Romans spoke Greek and admired Greek literature and art. The Greeks, in turn, found ways to assert cultural ties with Rome that helped cement the alliance of Greek and Roman culture. The story that the Romans are descended from the Trojans, for example, or the way in which the Roman pantheon became conflated with the Greek gods are examples of Greeks attempting to weave Rome into the Greek cultural fabric, rendering the Romans more like kinfolk than conquerors. To a very large degree this tactic worked: Roman literary and cultural expression was deeply indebted to Greece both before and after the Romans were politically dominant. And, of course, the Greeks worked hard to leverage their cultural prestige for political advantage.

Both sides were still pretty ethnocentric by modern standards, and both were happy to indulge in stereotyping and put downs. On the whole, though, it was more like a fractious, somewhat lopsided partnership than a conquest and occupation.
