He did.

> About this time [Octavian] had the sarcophagus and body of Alexander the Great brought forth from its shrine, and after gazing on it, showed his respect by placing upon it a golden crown and strewing it with flowers; and being then asked whether he wished to see the tomb of the Ptolemies as well, he replied, "My wish was to see a king, not corpses."

_Augustus at the Tomb of Alexander, by Lionel Royer_ 

However a later source ([Cassius Dio, book 51](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cassius_dio/51*.html)) also had this to say:

> [Octavian][ viewed the body of Alexander and actually touched it, __whereupon, it is said, a piece of the nose was broken off.__  But he declined to view the remains of the Ptolemies, though the Alexandrians were extremely eager to show them, remarking, "I wished to see a king, not corpses." For this same reason he would not enter the presence of Apis, either, declaring that he was accustomed to worship gods, not cattle.

So he may have visited a bit _too_ much. Later Roman emperors were not above a bit of grave-robbing either; Caligula liked to wear Alexander’s breastplate (it’s not clear what became of it) and Caracalla got his ring. Eventually Septimius Severus sealed up the tomb completely which is part of the reason we don’t know its whereabouts today (though there’s a good chance that it is underwater following the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami of 365)
