They’re not closely related. Nubian is generally regarded as closer to the [Nilo-Saharan languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilo-Saharan_languages), whose other members lie to the south and west in the direction of Lake Chad. Egyptian is usually grouped into the larger, catch-all basket of [Afroasiatic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages) which is very large. From a linguistic point of view Egyptian is closer to the [Cushitic ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushitic_languages)languages of the Horn of Africa, to Berber, and to Semitic languages like Hebrew and Arabic, than to Nubian.

Ir’s worth pointing out that there’s some confusion about the meaning of “Nubian” in this context — the parts of northern Sudan across the first cataract from Egypt takes its name from the [Nobatae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobatia), who first show up in our sources in the later Roman era. For a long, long time before that the area formed part of the [Kingdom of Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush), going back at least as far as end of the Bronze Age. The Kushites wrote in [Meroitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meroitic_language), which we can decipher to some degree but which has not produced enough texts to let us classify the language properly. [Our samples of the Nubian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Nubian_language) typically date much later, generally after around the year 300. Most of them are clearly written by people who were also in close communication with Egypt since they texts are usually Christian religious works written in a script derived from Coptic.

We don’t have good enough evidence to be sure if the historic Nubian population of the 4th-12th centuries were really indigenous to the region or if they were latecomers who replace or absorbed the Kushites — or how closely Meroitic may have been related to Egyptian.

There’s third language group in the area as well; in antiquity the [Blemmyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blemmyes) lived in the Eastern Desert (between the Nile and the Red Sea). They’re generally regarded as the ancestors of today’s [Beja people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beja_people), and spoke a Cushitic languages. They were there at least as early as the Kushites, around the end of the Bronze Age.
