Sadly, it appears that they did.

The question has been disputed on and off for the last couple of hundred years, but new archaeological evidence supporting the literary sources keeps emerging. However archaeology is almost always subject to competing interpretations, so the controversy persists. Since this question also touches on all sorts of present day politics, from anti-Semitism to anti-colonialism, it's not likely to disappear any time soon.

That said, I think the evidence is pretty solid and the counter-case is weak.

I'll start with the literary side, since that's more accessible and it deeply colors the way the archeology is read. There's a good wrapup of the relevant quotes [here](http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2012/05/31/sacrifices-of-children-at-carthage-the-sources/) -- I'll leave out the gory details, which are provided in the linked texts.

I will, however point out that the claim that the commonly repeated allegation that child sacrifice is "Roman propaganda" is clearly indefensible. The key sources for the practice are not Romans writing for Romans, they are Greeks writing in Greek for a Greek audience. More than that, _the stories antedate even the First Punic War by at least two generations_ . The earliest literary testimony to Carthaginian infant sacrifice is the Greek historian [Cleitarchus](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/cleitarchus/) who wrote about 50 years before the Romans and Carthaginians began their two centuries of conflict.

So if the child sacrifice stories are propaganda, it's definitively not Roman propaganda: it must date from the [Greco-Carthaginian Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Wars). That's far from impossible -- but it is quite a different argument from the one that is usually thrown around. Moreover the tradition may even go back as far as 480 BC: [Plutarch claims](http://www.attalus.org/old/sayings1.html#175) that after the [battle of Himera](http://www.livius.org/articles/battle/himera-480-bce) the Syracusan leader [Gelon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelo) forced the Carthaginians to abandon child sacrifice as part of the peace treaty ending the war (Montesquieu called it "the noblest treaty of peace ever mentioned in history.") Plutarch doesn't provide an attribution for this, but it seems to represent a tradition independent of the main sources usually cited in this debate.

Even accounting for the Greek tendency to recycle old works, the notion that an unsubstantiated piece of wartime propaganda could be repeated without challenge for more than four hundred years requires some backup. The case for seeing this as a 'blood libel' would be stronger if the allegation against the Carthaginians didn't have parallels with their mother-culture in Phoenicia. There are multiple, independent sources that assert infant sacrifice was practiced in Phoenicia. Some readers reflexively dismiss the references to Canaanite infant sacrifice in the Bible, but there is also the Hellenized Phoenician writer [Philo of Byblos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byblos) who says that the Phoenicians had in the past resorted to it in times of crisis. [Quintus Curtius Rufus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Curtius_Rufus), in his biography of Alexander, explicitly tied the Carthaginian and Phoenician practices together in his account of Alexander's siege of Tyre:

> Some [of the Tyrians] also advocated the revival of a religious rite which had been discontinued for many generations and which I certainly would not have thought to be at all acceptable to the gods – namely the sacrifice of a free-born male child to Saturn. (Such sacrilege – to use a more appropriate word than sacrifice – the Carthaginians inherited from their founders, and they are said to have continued the practice right down to the time of their city’s destruction.) Had it not been vetoed by the elders, whose judgement carried weight in all matters, cruel superstition would have triumphed over civilized behaviour.

More to the point [Tertullian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian), who lived all his life in Roman Africa writing in the late second century claims quite straightforwardly:

> Children were openly sacrificed in Africa to Saturn as lately as the proconsulship of Tiberius, who exposed to public gaze the priests suspended on the sacred trees overshadowing their temple-so many crosses on which the punishment which justice craved overtook their crimes, as the soldiers of our country still can testify who did that very work for that proconsul.

Again, there's a lot of unwillingness to take Tertullian's claim at face value, since he's a Christian apologist with an obvious reason for making his religious competitors look bad. However the book in which he makes the allegation was addressed directly to Roman magistrates. Making an obviously falsifiable claim to people in a position to verify it would be a strange rhetorical choice. The persistence of human sacrifice in other backwaters of the Roman world is attested in other contexts; in fact Pliny, writing less than a century before, condemned a human sacrifice at Rome itself "even in our own time" (_etiam nostra aetas vidit_ )* So the survival of the practice in the North African hinterland is not so inherently improbable that it can only be explained by slander.

To sum up: the literary evidence is, by ancient history standards, fairly strong. There are multiple sources that don't depend on each other, there is no explicit contradiction, and the claims -- while detestable -- aren't inherently unbelievable. As always with ancient history we're playing jigsaw-puzzle with a very incomplete set of pieces. But I think the confidence interval on the literary side is pretty high: certainly high enough to make it a valid complement to the archaeology.

As for the archaeological material, there's a good bit of it out there to interpret. One argument you can't make is here is the argument from silence: there are about a dozen Carthaginian sites (including Carthage proper) where special disposal of infant remains was practiced:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dcaf803a71e43af55944505f01afcb55-c)

Typically there sites (known as "tophets," after the Biblical designation for the sites of putative infant sacrifice in Canaan) contain the cremated remains of very young children, sometimes mixed with animal remains but no remains of adults or older children. The markers and grave goods are not consistent over time; the early layers at Carthage show a distinct Egyptian flair in style; later markers are more classically Punic with the abstract signs for the Carthaginian deities [Baal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal) and [Tanit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanit). The sites show some evidence of grave goods, like beads, and some evidence of ritual usage. They were not potters’ fields.

There is some technical debate over the nature of the remains. In general, [some archaeologists](http://www.livescience.com/23298-carthage-graveyard-not-child-sacrifice.html) interpret these as primarily fetal or neo-natal, and they regard this as a special kind of cemetery for stillborn infants and those who died very young, while [the opposing camp](http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/02/12/analysis-sheds-light-ancient-phoenician-child-sacrifice-mystery/) believes that remains are those of live-born infants. I'm not really qualified to judge the technical arguments but there's a good roundup of both sides [here](https://bonesdontlie.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/cemetery-or-sacrifice-in-carthage-again/). Unfortunately the most interesting sources cited seem to be locked behind academic paywalls.

For me, though, the clincher is not the bones but the [accompanying inscriptions](https://www.academia.edu/7783597/Epigraphy_of_the_tophet). Although these are obscure and formulaic, they tend to line up in the form

> To the Lord Ba'al Hammon, the vow that [Name] vowed

or similar formulae, often accompanied by a statement thanking the god for hearing the petitioner's prayer. I don't see any way to reconcile that with a regular cemetery, particularly since there's no evidence for separate child cemeteries for older children.

Moreover the numbers of interments are far, far too small to account for all stillbirths and infant deaths in a city like Carthage: there are about 20,000 burials in the Carthage tophet over a period of six centuries. The estimated population of Carthage before its destruction is as high as 500,000: at typical pre-modern infant mortality rates such a cemetery should have received thousands of such burials every year.** It's something of a comfort that the scope of the tophets is so small compared to the more mundane tragedies of ancient life: it does mean that the _modern_  stereotype of massive and systematic routine sacrifices is not true (it's also is not a claim made by the ancient sources, which almost always tie the practice to moments of crisis or desperation).

__TLDR__ 

The literary evidence is quite strong. Very little in ancient history is completely beyond debate, but many famous episodes are repeated as fact with noticeably less sourcing. Combine it with archaeological evidence which would at least conjecturally be interpreted as sacrifices in the absence of textual evidence and the case seems to be pretty hard to refute. There is a lot we don't know, since the Carthaginians can't speak for themselves; there may be nuances in the practice that the Greeks and Romans missed that might make it seem less heinous. But the odds are very good that it happened: the counter case requires ignoring too much historiography and the epigraphic evidence.

It's a shame, because there are a such good reasons to want this story to be false. The Italian archaeologists who popularized the notion that this was a myth were in part reacting to the legacy of Italian Fascism and anti-Semitism. Modern North African scholars who defend the Carthaginian legacy often want to promote local history as a counterweight to Islamist rejectionism. Post-colonial scholars are right to wish that we had more than one side of this history. And of course most of all, nobody wants to believe such things go on.

Unfortunately they sometimes do.

_** With the caveat that I'm not a statistician: I'm guessing that at a 35 per 1000 birth rate and a 350 per 1000 infant mortality rate, a city of 500,000 would produce more than 6000 infant deaths a year._
