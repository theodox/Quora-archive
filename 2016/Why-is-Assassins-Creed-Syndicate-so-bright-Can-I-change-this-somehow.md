From what I’ve read they don’t expose the gamma correction slider in this version - it may be in the patch that’s supposed to be in the works.

If your monitor has a gamma control (as distinct from a brightness/contrast control: not the same thing!) you should be able to get more midtones by adjusting that. You’re not the only one complaining:
