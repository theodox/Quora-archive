Yes, although over the course of the imperial period they metamophosed from empowered elected officials into, for the most part, either appointive administrators or purely ceremonial roles.

Under the republic there were several “grades” of magistrates, most of whom were elected annually and served for one year. Almost all Roman magistracies had multiple colleagues — the Romans were very worried about too much power in individual hands. The numbers of the different grades fluctuated over time — the numbers below represent the late Republic.

[Quaestors](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/quaestor/) (20), who were essentially financial secretaries although they were also empowered to investigate certain kinds of crimes

[Aediles](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/aedile/) (4), who administered public works and oversaw public festivals

[Tribunes](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/tribune/) (10) who were public ombudsmen — they could override the decision of another magistrate or a court. They were also empowered to call popular assemblies where the citizenry could enact new laws

[Praetors ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetor)(10), who were primarily judges but who also had military duties.

[Consuls](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/consul/) (2) the supreme commanders of the Roman armies and chief executives in civil affairs.

The Senate was not elected directly — all former magistrates became senators for life after their terms ended, assuming they could meet the (substantial) property qualification.

At five year intervals the Romans also elected [Censors](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/censor/) — the only regular office with a single holder. Censors were in charge of maintaining the rolls of citizens — in particular, they could eject someone from the Senate either for failing the property qualification or for “immoral behavior.”

The series of offices was known as the “[Cursus honorum](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/cursus-honorum/)” or “run of honors” — every Roman aristocrat’s goal was to work his way up the ladder from quaestor to consul and — if he was extraordinarily lucky — to censor. Because the different magistracies had age requirements there were typically gaps of a few years between offices, though in emergencies (or with extraordinary political pull) those rules were sometimes violated.

Under the empire, most of the magistracies stopped being real political offices and instead became ceremonial honors. The actual work of governance was typically done by appointed imperial officers, usually not from the old Senatorial class. The old magistracies lingered on in a mostly ceremonial fashion with little real power under the emperors. The running of the state was left primarily to imperial _[prefects](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/prefect/)_ , a title which emphasized the fact that they didn’t have personal authority and were instead to be regarded as the emperor’s personal representatives.

Some quaestors continued to be elected but some were appointed by the emperor; the post was really a kind of proving ground for aristocrats the emperors might want to recruit for important jobs. The aedile’s job was effectively taken over by the (appointed) urban prefect of Rome, so the aedilate became a more or less meaningless (and not very prestigious) honor granted by emperors — eventually the only practical component was regulating brothels. The praetorate became exclusively a judicial office, “elected” by the Senate under the eye of the emperor. The emperors assumed the rights and duties of the tribunes, although the office lingered on as another mostly honorary post with no real power. Lastly the consulate turned into a purely formal honor with only ceremonial duties, appointed by the emperor as a political favor and often done more than once a year to spread the goodies around.
