# Why did so many pre-modern cultures believe eclipses were mystical events? Given the astronomy possessed by the ancient Greeks, ancient Chinese, Muslims, and others, the path of the moon must have been known well enough to provide an explanation.

Eclipses overall are pretty common — maybe two in three years. But for that’s for the entire planet. For any particular place on earth the numbers are wildly different for a number of reasons:

The average is about around four centuries.

Now, position that in a world where most people spend their entire lives within fifty or sixty miles of where they are born…. where there are hundreds of local languages getting in the way of information sharing…. and where most people are illiterate. Of course the sudden disappearance of the sun is going to come as a shock. If it takes three occurrences in a given place to figure out what’s going on that means it takes _over a thousand years._ It’s actually a testament to how incredibly clever our ancestors were that they figured this stuff out at all.

And they did.

For example, the [eclipse of Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_of_Thales#:~:text=The%20eclipse%20of%20Thales%20was,Greek%20philosopher%20Thales%20of%20Miletus.&text=Many%20historians%20believe%20that%20the,of%2028%20May%20585%20BC) — 28 May 585 BC — is believed to be the first one predicted in advance. It happened right in the middle on a historic battle:

> As, however, the balance had not inclined in favour of either nation, another combat took place in the sixth year, in the course of which, just as the battle was growing warm, day was on a sudden changed into night. This event had been foretold by Thales, the Milesian, who forewarned the Ionians of it, fixing for it the very year in which it actually took place. The Medes and Lydians, when they observed the change, ceased fighting, and were alike anxious to have terms of peace agreed on.

Herodotus, 1.73

It’s far from clear how Thales actually did it — he may have somehow extrapolated from Babylonian astronomical records, which by that point already included hundreds of years of observations. But even if Thales had some kind of rationalist explanation for the event, the account above shows that his contemporaries did not. In the ancient world knowledge diffused slowly and unevenly.

For example the [eclipse of Pericles](https://cof.quantumfuturegroup.org/events/2652#:~:text=It%20seems%20quite%20likely%20that,431%20BC%20himself%20at%20Athens.&text=It%20is%20related%20that%20a,eclipse%2C%20thus%20dispelling%20the%20alarm.) (31 August 431 BC) was seen in Athens, where a number of astronomers had articulated the idea that a lunar eclipse was just the shadow of the moon passing over the earth. As it happened the most powerful politician of the day was also a student of the astronomer [Anaxagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaxagoras), so when an eclipse occurred he calmly explained the situation and nobody panicked:

> in the great war, in which the Athenians and Lacedæmonians contended with such violent resentment, the famous Pericles, the first man of his country, in credit, eloquence, and political genius, observing the Athenians overwhelmed with an excessive alarm, during an eclipse of the sun, which cast a universal shadow, told them what he had learned in the school of Anaxagoras, that these phenomena necessarily happened at precise and regular periods when the body of the moon was interposed between the sun and the earth, and that if they happened not before every new moon, it was because they could only happen when the new moons fell at certain specific periods. Having evinced this truth by his reasonings, he freed the people from their alarms. At that period, indeed, the doctrine was new and unfamiliar, respecting the eclipse of the sun by the interposition of the moon. They say that Thales of Miletus, was the first to discover it.

Cicero, _Republic_ 1.16

And yet a couple of decades later, the [Eclipse of Nicias](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995JRASC..89...11M) (27 August, 413 BC) surprised and disheartened Athenian forces campaigning in Sicily. Their superstitious reaction to the eclipse helped contribute to their catastrophic defeat (which, of course, would merely confirm to those who were there that the whole thing was in fact a stunning expression of divine wrath). There had to have been quite a few soldiers and sailors who saw both eclipses* — but, absent both a widely accepted rationalist explanation _and_ Pericles’ unusual charisma, the reactions varied widely. The Athenian army decided to stay put for a “lucky” 27 days to avoid this scary omen — and, pinned to a bad location, was defeated.

And of course, having lived through things like the [Mayapocalypse](https://boingboing.net/2012/12/11/donate-to-public-knowledge-av.html) ourselves, we can’t really say that things have changed that much. Cultures don’t believe things, though they provide a series of templates (usually, messy and contradictory ones) for how to think about them. Individuals think things — and individual thinking is always all over the place.



* It’s worth mentioning that Syracuse is almost 500 miles from Athens. If those soldiers had stayed home, they would not have seen the second eclipse.
