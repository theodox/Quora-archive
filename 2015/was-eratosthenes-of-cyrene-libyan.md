Not on his father's side, at any rate. 

Callimachus of Alexandria says that Eratosthenes was a _Battiad_ , which would make him a lineal descendant of the original Greek colonists (led by [Battus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battus_I_of_Cyrene), hence the name). If that's correct then he was an ethnic Greek, and of an aristocratic family. His father's name as Aglaos -- a pretty common if old-fashioned Greek name .

Of course, in a colonial society there is always more mixing or peoples than we tend to believe -- it's not impossible that there were native Libyans in his background. In Ptolemaic Egypt (where we have better records) you can see many shades of inter-mingling between Greeks and Egyptians. The upper classes tended to be more exclusive, though, and Erastosthenes' family was clearly well off (he finished his studies in Athens). 

Eratosthenes did however write a book contradicting Aristotle's division of the human race into "Hellenes" and "Barbarians," so that may reflect his experience in multicultural Libya and Egypt. It might be useful to compare this experience with Anglo-Indian writers who grew up in households that were self-consciously "English" -- but were raised by Indian nannies and surrounded by Indian culture and often had an outsider's perspective on "English" life.

Arete's father was [ Aristippus](http://Â Aristippus) , who was something of a character in stories of Greek philosophers. He features in many anecdotes, some of them almost certainly made up, most of which illustrate his 'it's all good' kind of laid-back philosophy. I don't think any of them comment on his background, but at the time he was famous (before Alexander's conquests had made Hellenism a pose that many non-Greeks would adopt) it would be surprising if a non-Greek origin passed without any comment.

In the later Hellenistic period - after the 2d century BC - it became common for any wealthy or educated person to adopt Greek or Roman names and cultural attitudes regardless of their ethnic background. By the height of the Roman empire in the second and third century you could find literary and political figures from lots of backgrounds -- writers like Lucian of Samosata (an Assyrian) or Juba of Mauretania (Greek and Numidian) and even emperors like Philip the Arab (Syrian). Emperor Septimius Severus and his family were of mixed Roman and Punic origin (they evidently had family both in Phoenicia and Roman Africa) and it's thought that on the Carthaginian side his family included Libyan ancestors.
