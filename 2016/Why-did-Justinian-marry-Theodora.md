Well, given that our only _intimate_  view of the relationship is one of the world’s great monuments to spite, it’s hard to say we know for real.

Our main sources are the works of [Procopius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procopius), which are inherently dubious. His primary literary output was government-issue propaganda: approved official histories and panegyrics of Justinian and his court. But he’s most famous, or perhaps infamous, for the [Anecdota](http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/procop-anec.asp) or “Unpublished Material” — usually known in English by the spicier title “The Secret History”. It’s a lot like trying to reconstruct the history of Jennifer Aniston from competing pro- and anti-Jen tabloids, with the additional wrinkle that they are written by the same person.

In the Anecdota Procopius savages every aspect of Justinian and Theodora’s characters and relationship with enormous relish and tabloid tastes, which have rendered it a perennial favorite for over a thousand years. He doesn’t describe their courtship directly, though he devotes several pages to a detailed description of the empress’ former career as an actress — which, by ancient tradition, was often another name for ‘prostitute’.

According to Procopius, Justinian was besotted with Theodora for her physical charms and her seductive wiles. He depicts her as an orphan condemned to a brothel at an early age, and then an actress:

> she was not a flute or harp player, nor was she even trained to dance, but only gave her youth to anyone she met, in utter abandonment. Her general favors included, of course, the actors in the theater; and in their productions she took part in the low comedy scenes. For she was very funny and a good mimic, and immediately became popular in this art. There was no shame in the girl, and no one ever saw her dismayed: no role was too scandalous for her to, accept without a blush.

> She was the kind of comedienne who delights the audience by letting herself be cuffed and slapped on the cheeks, and makes them guffaw by raising her skirts to reveal to the spectators those feminine secrets here and there which custom veils from the eyes of the opposite sex. With pretended laziness she mocked her lovers, and coquettishly adopting ever new ways of embracing, was able to keep in a constant turmoil the hearts of the sophisticated. And she did not wait to be asked by anyone she met, but on the contrary, with inviting jests and a comic flaunting of her skirts herself tempted all men who passed by, especially those who were adolescent.

and

> Often, even in the theater, in the sight of all the people, she removed her costume and stood nude in their midst, except for a girdle about the groin: not that she was abashed at revealing that, too, to the audience, but because there was a law against appearing altogether naked on the stage, without at least this much of a fig-leaf. Covered thus with a ribbon, she would sink down to the stage floor and recline on her back. Slaves to whom the duty was entrusted would then scatter grains of barley from above into the calyx of this passion flower, whence geese, trained for the purpose, would next pick the grains one by one with their bills and eat. When she rose, it was not with a blush, but she seemed rather to glory in the performance.

He claims, at least, that Theodora only reached socially acceptable rank because Justinian (not yet emperor) promoted her; he also claims that Justinian enriched her and gave her great political power and wealth.

> But when she came back to Constantinople, Justinian fell violently in love with her. At first he kept her only as a mistress, though he raised her to patrician rank. Through him Theodora was able immediately to acquire an unholy power and exceedingly great riches. she seemed to him the sweetest thing in the world, and like all lovers, he desired to please his charmer with every possible favor and requite her with all his wealth. The extravagance added fuel to the flames of passion. With her now to help spend his money he plundered the people more than ever, not only in the capital, but throughout the Roman Empire.

Which sounds good but, on closer examination, is pretty dubious: How, exactly, did Justinian enrich Theodora without impoverishing himself? And how did she “help” him in plundering the people? Does a powerful agent of the court and imperial relative really need the assistance of a jumped up stripper to achieve his goals, however nefarious?

According to Procopius, anyway, Justinian and Theodora could not marry under the law which forbade a member of the Senatorial order to marry a courtesan

(the actual legal basis of the prohibition is foggy, it may go all the way back to the very restrictive marriage laws of Augustus — which suggests that maybe this case was political: not many other aspects of a 500 year old regulation were so scrupulously observed in 6th century Constantinople).

According to Procopius the marriage was long stalled by the [empress Euphemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemia_(empress)), who was a pious if otherwise ineffectual old lady — a story which is rendered somewhat problematic by his assertion elsewhere that the empress herself was a former slave and concubine. After her death, though, the law was changed to allow the marriage. However, as Justinian increasingly became the real power in Constantinople and his predecessor [Justin ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_I)began to disappear from the political stage, the new ruler had the law changed to allow aristocrats to marry “reformed” courtesans and actresses.

The actual law (_[Codex Justinianus V.IV.XXIII](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/justinian/codex5.shtml)_ ) is couched in terms of social reform: the stated intent, anyway, is to allow for the reformation of former sex workers by offering them the hope of a respectable future. It fits in with [a trend in 5th and 6th century laws](http://amzn.to/1XHEWMY) which addressed the dubious tangle of relationships between slavery, legal marriage, concubinage and prostitution from an explicitly Christian standpoint: it’s very difficult to see if Procopius is revealing an imperial scandal or being deliberately obtuse and trying to portray a piece of progressive social legislation as a sleazy conspiracy.

Procopius, of course, portrays the change in the law and the marriage as a scandal - but in terms that make it sound almost like a popular success:

> …Not a single member of even the Senate, seeing this disgrace befalling the State, dared to complain or forbid the event; but all of them bowed down before her as if she were a goddess. Nor was there a priest who showed any resentment, but all hastened to greet her as Highness. And the populace who had seen her before on the stage, directly raised its hands to proclaim itself her slave in fact and in name. Nor did any soldier grumble at being ordered to risk the perils of war for the benefit of Theodora: nor was there any man on earth who ventured to oppose her.

The completeness of this victory — which of course is, in Procopius eyes, a shameful surrender — casts the whole situation in a peculiar light. He seems to be saying , in a backhanded way, that the match was popular and successful. This seems like such a peculiar admission for the old gossip that it’s easy to envision the counter-interpretation.

That view is best set out in [The Empress Theodora: Partner of Justinian ](http://amzn.to/1X6OvXd)where Theodora is portrayed as a powerful woman who championed the outcasts and socially disrespected. She was a champion of the [Monophysites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophysitism) — and, as empress, provided a focus for their loyalty to Constantinople. Even more than most empresses she was a champion of the disadvantaged — her charities were widespread and popular, and as somebody who grew up on the fringes at least of real poverty she could have been more effective than more insular aristocratic ladies whose actual connection to the poor was less authentic. Theodora was also, like Justinian, tied in to the Blues, one of the two political-faction-cum-sports-hooligan-gangs which [dominated Constantinople](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/blue-versus-green-rocking-the-byzantine-empire-113325928/?no-ist). As a young woman she was supported by their social network; as an empress she showed them favor and, in the deadly[ Nika riots](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/circusmaximus/nika.html) their support turned out to be critical to the survival of the dynasty.

Unfortunately it’s not very easy to really know where the truth lies. Procopius is our main source, and even though we know he’s untrustworthy he is almost all we have to work with. The power-mad seductress and the charismatic champion of the downtrodden are mirror images because we don’t have the materials to construct any other interpretations.

As an afterthought, it’s worth mentioning that even Procopius found himself unable to deny her charisma.

> Now Theodora was fair of face and of a very graceful, though small, person; her complexion was moderately colorful, if somewhat pale; and her eyes were dazzling and vivacious.

In his published writings he also claimed that her statues didn’t do justice to the living woman. It’s probably one of the few things he says that can be trusted, since it’s one of the few things the public and the private Procopius agreed on.
