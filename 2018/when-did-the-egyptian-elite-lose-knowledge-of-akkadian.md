There’s not a lot of evidence to go on; Akkadian inscriptions are extremely rare in Egypt — fewer than a hundred items within Egypt and about a hundred items of diplomatic correspondence found in the Hittite capital of Hattusas. All of them date to the 14th or 13th century BC.

There was a long period in the 13th and 12th centuries when diplomatic correspondence became much less important. The so-called [Bronze Age collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse) (~ 1200 - 1150 BC) was a chaotic period that disrupted the politics of the Near East and Mesopotamia. Only Egypt survived the disaster more or less intact — at the [Battle of the Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Delta) in 1175 BC the Egyptians staved off a major invasion by the [mysterious “Sea Peoples.”](https://www.quora.com/Where-did-the-Sea-Peoples-the-people-who-invaded-Greece-Egypt-and-the-Hittite-Empire-in-the-Late-Bronze-Age-come-from) Their traditional Hittite rivals, and the many smaller states in Canaan, the Levant and Syria were overthrown, however — the need for carefully worded treaties was replaced by the need for strong border guards.

Although we don’t have hard evidence, it’s a good bet that some Egyptians retained knowledge of Akkadian for practical matters. Even during the inward-looking period of retrenchment in the 21st dynasty (1069 - 1045 BC) there was still commerce to consider. For example the [Story of Wenamun ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Wenamun)dates from around this period and shows a rather hapless Egyptian scribe trying to arrange the purchase of Lebanese cedar from a hostile and dismissive prince of the Tjekker, one of the Sea Peoples. It’s hard to see how this sort of business would have been managed and recorded except in Akkadian.

Akkadian remained the common language of trade for another couple of centuries until it was gradually displaced as a _lingua franca_ by Aramaic. The first diplomatic correspondence involving Egypt in Aramaic shows up around 600 BC, but given the long and deadly rivalry between Egypt and the revived Assyrian empire through the 8th and 7th centuries its unlikely that the Egyptian chancery was not well versed in Aramaic before that. If nothing else the Assyrian occupation of Lower Egypt (671–620) must have taught a few Egyptians Aramaic the hard way.
