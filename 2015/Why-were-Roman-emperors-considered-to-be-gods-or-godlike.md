It's actually a borrowing from Greek politics.

 _Alexander the Great - the horns over his ears are the ram horns of the Egyptian god Amun, who he proclaimed was his father_ 

Alexander the Great had [declared himself to be a god](http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t11.html) during his conquest of the Persian Empire; it's not altogether clear how seriously he expected his Greek subjects to take this but he clearly felt it useful as he stepped into the place of the Pharoahs of Egypt and the Shahs of Persia, both of whom had ruled as living divinities. When he died and his empire fell apart, the various generals who divvied up his empire adopted the same idea to various degrees. Earlier Greek generations had been pretty contemptuous of the idea of 'god kings' (in fact, of kings in general with the exception of Sparta) but during the generations of factional warfare that followed Alexander's death a lot of Greeks were willing to swallow their pride and offer divine honors to anybody who would leave them in peace.

Greek tradition had always included a sort of halfway status between humans and divinities: our word _hero_  derives from the Greek word for mortals who had achieved legendary feats: Hercules, Oedipus, and Theseus, for example were clearly mortal but also divinely favored; they received sacrifices and prayers that were similar to those offered to the immortals so there was a not entirely abject precedent for treating rulers as divine. In large parts of the post-Alexander world divine monarchy was already an immemorial tradition and adopting the local customs made ruling over diverse empires easier (Alexander's adoption of Ammon as his 'father' was extremely popular in Egypt, where the Persians had shunned the tradition of the Pharoahs).

_Despite appearances. Cleopatra was a descendant of Alexander's general Ptolemy - though she doubled as an Egyptian god-queen_  

__Rome__ 

Rome grew into a world power in a world where the key powers were ruled by Alexander's successors. Diplomatic protocol and publicity required a certain level of formal attention to the 'divinity' of kings like the Ptolemies and the Seleucids (at this time of year it's worth pointing out that the Jewish holiday Hannukah commemorates a revolt against the Seleucid Emperor [Antiochus IV Epiphanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes) who wanted force the Jews to offer sacrifice to Zeus, that is, to himself as Zeus' manifestation on earth)** 

Romans generally looked on divine monarchies with contempt. Until the Republic was destroyed, Romans were deeply anti-monarchical; even Julius Caesar at the height of his power didn't dare accept a crown for fear of a popular reaction, and Rome was a monarchy in practice for generations before it admitted that is was no longer a sturdy Republic of free men. However, when the Republic did fall the temptation to follow the Greek model was harder and harder to resist. In half of the empire the habit of ruler-worship was already quite common and to a degree spontaneous - not a few successful Roman generals had been accorded divine honors while operating in the Greek east. Under the Republic, though, when they returned home to celebrate their triumphs Roman tradition made sure that a slave rode beside the _imperator_ in his chariot, whispering _Hominem te esse memento! Memento mori!,_ that is _Remember you are a man, and remember that you are mortal!_ 

The Roman adoption of the Greek idea of divine monarchy was gradual. Augustus, the first emperor, allowed the establishment of a Greek-style ruler cult in the provinces but didn't impose it in Rome or much of the Latin-speaking west.

_Emperor Augustus of Rome, following the example of the Ptolemies in Egypt_ 

Augustus -- who was extremely popular during his lifetime -- was officially proclaimed a _divus_ , a "divine being" (not a "god") only after his death. His immediate successors were generally honored the same way, though the practice at first didn't seem to have much hold on the Roman imagination: Emperor Vespasian's last words were _Dear me, I think I'm becoming a god!_  and Nero's chancellor [Seneca ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger)penned a deeply derisive satire on that emperor's predecessor called the [Apocolocyntosis, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocolocyntosis)literally "the Pumpkinification of Claudius." which plays on the word _apotheosis_  and makes fun of Claudius' reception on Olympus.

_The late emperor Antoninus Pius and his wife (top center) ascend to the heavens, ca. 161._ 

The first emperor to officially refer to himself as divine during his own lifetime was [Domitian, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domitian) a murderous paranoid who tried to build a kind of proto-Stalinist cult of personality around himself. His successors, though, were generally less bombastic until the 3rd century, when the Roman world was wracked by a long series of destructive civil wars. Many of the competing would-be emperors (more than 50 in a single century!) tried to legitimize their rule using their 'divine' status. Not coincidentally this period witnesses the beginning of aggressive persecution against Christians, Jews and other religious dissenters. Only in the third century do you start to see emperors depicted with halos or radiate crowns, which were symbols of divinity imported primarily from Persia and the Near East. 

The emperors lost their oficial divine status after the adoption of Christianity but important elements remained. You can see it in official titles like that of _comes sacrarum largitionum,_ literally 'count of the sacred largess' but meaning more like 'the emperor's tax collector' even well into the 6th century. And while the Christian emperors could no longer be gods some of them didn't mind being depicted as saints. like Justinian in this mosaic from the 540's.
