There’s just one who may have been _illiterate_ , and he’s pretty late: [Justin I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_I) (r. 518–527) was a Balkan peasant who rose through the ranks of the Roman army and eventually ended up on the throne in Constantinople. According to Procopius, Justin was illiterate and had to use a stencil to sign his name. Of course, Procopius hated Justin’s successor and nephew Justinian, so it would not be impossible that this is a slander.

Literacy rates among Roman elites were quite high. We don’t have great data for ordinary people, but any politically active Roman was expected to be literate and many ordinary people were as well. Every legion has a significant staff of literate soldiers(shorthand was a particularly prized skill) to handle things like logistics and correspondence. So, literacy was anything but exotic in the Roman government or military.

There’s also the corner case of Charlemagne, who at least claimed to be a Roman emperor:

> The King spent much time and labour with him studying rhetoric, dialectics, and especially astronomy; he learned to reckon, and used to investigate the motions of the heavenly bodies most curiously, with an intelligent scrutiny. He also tried to write, and used to keep tablets and blanks in bed under his pillow, that at leisure hours he might accustom his hand to form the letters; however, as he did not begin his efforts in due season, but late in life, they met with ill success.
