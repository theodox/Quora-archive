Full Spartan citizens — an elite minority — were _[Spartiates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartiate)_ _,_ or sometimes _homoioi_ , “equals” which emphasized the ideal that the citizen class was not divided by wealth or hereditary privilege even though it presided over a very unequal society. When talking about their political identity (rather than their class identity) we use _Lakedaemonians_  to describe their membership in the Spartan city-state. _Lakonians_  describes their geographical origin in the region of Lakonia.

There was a significant population of free non-citizens in historic Sparta. These were usually described as _[peroikoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioeci)_ (roughly, “suburbanites”) . Since the _homoioi_  were forbidden to take up trades apart from soldiering, the _periokoi_  handled the non-agricultural parts of the Spartan economy. Periokoi had their own self-governing communities (ancient writers describe these as _poleis,_ ie, city-states) but they had to follow the Spartan lead in matters of warfare and foreign policy. Many _periokoi_ were simply the inhabitants of cities and towns which the Spartans had conquered, though there were also resident aliens. Periokoi formed part of the Spartan army, and fought as hoplite infantry alongside the spartiates. There was also a second class of free non-citizens known as _skiritai._ These lived in the rugged territory of Arcadia and they fought in the Spartan army as scouts and skirmishers. Skiritai seem to have lived a more rural, independent life than periokoi.

The bulk of the population, however, was made up of a group more or less like serfs. These were the _[helots](https://www.quora.com/How-long-did-the-Spartans-have-slaves/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=4bdbf9b9&srid=zLvM)_ _._  They weren’t slaves in the conventional sense — they could not be bought and sold individually. Instead, they were tied to the land under the collective ownership of the Spartan state, which assigned them to individual spartiates as tenant farmers or personal attendants. Most helots were descended from people whom the Spartans had conquered; some ancient authors accidentally use _Messenians_ — the name of the people of the western Peloponnessus whom the Spartans conquered around 720 BC — as a synonym for _“_ helot_”_ even though there were helots in other parts of the Spartan territory too.

Under ordinary circumstances, helotry was inherited and most helots had even less chance that an ordinary slave of being freed. However there were a few occasions when the Spartans were desperate enough to enfranchise helots.* These newly freed helots were known as _[neodamodeis](https://www.ancient.eu/Neodamodeis/)_ __ (“lately made one of the people”)__ and they seem to have had a status like that of the _periokoi._ 

One last category — we can’t really know how large it was in practice — was formed by the children of spartiate men and helot women. These were known as _nothoi_ (literally, “bastards”). They might be raised more or less as Spartans, in which case they were known as _mothakes._ A _mothax_  could receive a Spartan education and be raised as a citizen — two famous Spartan commanders ([Gylippus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gylippus)and [Lysander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander)) were _mothakes._ We don’t know, however, how common this was (or how consensual the relations between the spartiate father and helot mother were).



_*_ However in [one notorious episode](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&getid=1&query=Thuc.%204.80) the Spartans promised to free a large contingent of helots as a reward for their service against Persia, but they then murdered the entire group on the theory that their bravery and military experience made them a threat.
