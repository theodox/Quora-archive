People tend to be pretty sloppy with the terminology, and the main rule is probably “what sounds good in this sentence” rather than “what’s a logically consistent use of terms”.

If you want to be more precise:

Before the first century it’s usually safe to use the terms interchangeably; under the Republic Rome the city-state was also the moving force in the policy for “Roman territory” (except, of course, when the leadership of Rome was disputed, for example during the civil war between Marius and Sulla).

From the first through the third century effective policy direction really came from the emperors. Many of them used the city as their headquarters, but many didn’t. The third century was wracked by constant civil war, very few emperors controlled the entire Roman world for more than a couple of years and so it’s rarely going to easy to say “Rome did such and such” unless “such and such” is “suffered chaos.”

After about 285, when the era of civil wars ended, Rome the city was no longer particularly closely tied to the actual governance of the empire. The Senate stayed there but it didn’t _do_  much, while the emperors tended to reside closer to the army on the frontiers, at Augusta Treverorum (=Treves), Arelate (=Arles), Ravenna, or Mediolanum (=Milan). The handful of emperors who ran both the eastern and western halves of the empire after that time all resided in Constantinople. So after 285 when somebody says “Rome did X” you can be pretty much assume that it means “the emperor and his bureaucrats did X”.
