It's actually hard to say. The 'official' reorganization was under Diocletian, who split the empire into two overarching military commands with an _Augustus_  as commander and a _Caesar_  as second-in-command and heir-apparent. The idea was twofold - to increase military effectiveness by shortening lines of communication, and to formalize the truth which became very painfully apparent in the [Crisis of the Third Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century): that in what was, essentially, a military dictatorship power rested with the generals so it was thought wiser to make it obvious and also provide some built-in checks on ambitious militarists. There were no fewer than 33 (!) emperors in the 50 years leading to Diocletian: he was right to accept that the empire needed stability and strong frontiers more than it needed another ambitious general on top. His solution didn't last long... but that's another story.

_[Diocletian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian)_ _,_ _[Maximian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximian)_ _,_ _[Galerius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galerius)_ _and_ _[Constantius Chlorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantius_Chlorus)_ _. "Like a chorus, speaking with one voice"_ 

 The practice actually has roots that go all the way back to Augustus, in the sense that Roman emperors ([who were almost never succeeded by their own children)](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires) typically adopted intended successors as the grew older. The 'designated heir' would be given an increasing set of titles and responsibilities in order to groom him for future rule. Augustus had groomed [Germanicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanicus), [Lucius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Caesar) , [Gaius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Caesar) and [Tiberius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius) as potential heir, though ill-luck and reputedly court intrigue left Tiberius the only survivor. Vespasian included his sons Titus and Domitian in his rule, and so on. 

The practice of collegial rule was formalized by [Nerva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerva#Death_and_legacy), who adopted [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan) as "Caesar" in 97 (probably to forestall a mutiny in the army as he aged... but that's another story). The first pairing of "Augusti" was when [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius#Death_and_succession_180) formally elevated his son, the useless [Commodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus) to co-rulership in 177. That was the precedent for Diocletian's use of the term during the [Tetrarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrarchy).
