Alexander inherited the project of attacking the Persian Empire from his father, [Phillip](https://dailyhistory.org/How_did_Phillip_II_of_Macedon_change_Ancient_Greek_history%3F). The Macedonians had a long and complicated relationship with Persia for a couple of hundred years. For most of that time the Macedonians were unwilling Persian subjects, although they definitely played both sides of the fence — Macedonian troops under [Alexander I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Macedon) were part of the Persian invasion force under Xerxes, but that Alexander betrayed the Persians once it was clear that the invasion had been defeated.

Persia at this point was a huge and unbelievably wealthy empire. However it was extremely shaky as Philip and Alexander perceived quite clearly. There had been several revolts by high-ranking Persian officials and low-grade wars between rival provinces; Egypt had broken away and only recently been reconquered; and above all [Darius III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_III) was an unpopular ruler installed by a [treacherous vizier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagoas) who had poisoned both of the two previous emperors. The combination of enormous wealth and dubious leadership made Persia an extremely tempting target.

As for Mesopotamia — it was the economic heart of the Persian empire, and it lay directly on the route to the Persian capitals in Susa, Ecbatana and Persepolis.

If you were fighting the Persians, you were probably going to capture Mesopotamia. It didn’t hurt that the Persians were not native to the region: they had conquered Babylon and Assyria in the days of Cyrus — while they were not particularly unpopular conquerors, they were definitely foreign occupiers. The whole region surrendered to Alexander without a fight after he defeated Darius for good at Gaugamela — none of the locals seem to have been very interested in dying for Persia.

Here’s an [ancient description of how Alexander was received by the Persian garrison and the civilian populace of Bablyon](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/curtius-rufus/alexander-the-great-enters-babylon/). It helps give a sense of how little dismay the conquest actually caused in Mesopotamia.

> A large number of the Babylonians had taken up a position on the walls, eager to have a view of their new king, but most went out to meet him, including the man in charge of the citadel and royal treasury, Bagophanes. Not to be outdone by Mazaeus in paying his respects to Alexander, Bagophanes had carpeted the whole road with flowers and garlands and set up at intervals on both sides silver altars heaped not just with frankincense but with all manner of perfumes.

> Following him were his gifts - herds of cattle and horses, and lions, too, and leopards, carried along in cages.

> Next came the [Magians](http://www.livius.org/maa-mam/magians/magians.html) chanting a song in their native fashion, and behind them were the Chaldaeans,note then the Babylonians, represented not only by priests but also by musicians equipped with their national instrument. (The role of the latter was to sing the praises of the Persian kings, that of the Chaldaeans to reveal astronomical movements and regular seasonal changes.)

> At the rear came the Babylonian cavalry, their equipment and that of the horses suggesting extravagance rather than majesty.

> Surrounded by an armed guard, the king instructed the townspeople to follow at the rear of his infantry; then he entered the city on a chariot and went into the palace. The next day he made an inspection of Darius' furniture and all his treasure,
