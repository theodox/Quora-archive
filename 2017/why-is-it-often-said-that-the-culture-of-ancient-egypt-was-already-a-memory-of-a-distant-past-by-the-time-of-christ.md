By that point Egypt had been ruled by foreigners for most of the previous millennium. The glory days of Egyptian power were as distant from them as Saxon England or the medieval splendor of Baghdad are from us.

The last powerful native Egyptian dynasty collapsed shortly after 1000 BC, [leading to about 400 years of civil wars and foreign occupations.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Intermediate_Period_of_Egypt) During that period Egypt was either split into competing kingdoms or occupied by outsiders, including the Libyans, the Nubians, and Assyrians. The Egyptians briefly got back control of the country in 664 BC, but the Persians conquered Egypt in 525 BC. The Egyptians revolted twice, but in neither case could they free themselves for more than about a generation. Alexander the Great conquered Persian Egypt in 332, and descendants of one of his generals ruled the country until the Roman takeover in 27 BC — Cleopatra was one of them.

It is not as if people entirely forgot about the Egyptian past —the temples and monuments were still there, and at least among the priests (who were well paid by the Greek rulers) the old inscriptions and texts could still be read. However ordinary people used a simplified writing system or Greek in their daily lives. More importantly, the central tradition of the ancient Egyptian religion was worship of the pharaoh as a living god; when the pharaoh was a foreigner (particularly a Greek who rarely left the city of Alexandria and didn’t even speak Egyptian) it was hard to really stay enthusiastic. The old official state religion gradually gave way to more individually oriented beliefs, particularly those centered on Isis and Osiris, and eventually Egypt adopted Christianity much earlier than most of the Roman empire.
