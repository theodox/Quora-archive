# In a very optimistic scenario, if the Hittite empire had not collapsed, could it have helped the Egyptians to fight against Persia?

It’s a long, long way from the Hittites — who drop out of the historical record in the crazy years of the Bronze Age Collapse just after 1200 BC — to the Persian invasion of Egypt in 525. Even the [post-Hittite statelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syro-Hittite_states) which survived in northern Syria after the fall of the Hittite heartland in Anatolia disappeared before about 700 BC. So it would have to be a _very_  optimistic scenario.

In any case, unless things were markedly different that the way the worked in our timeline, the role that a rump-Hittite state would play would inevitably resemble the position of the historical [Lydian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia) — which is to say, the Persians would still have won.

Lydia’s center of gravity was farther west than that of the Hittites: the eastern boundary of Lydia was the river Halys, which formed the western limit of the “Land of Hatti”, the Hittite capital region. The eastern half of the old Hittite territory ended up in the hands of the Medes after they and the Babylonians overthrew the Assyrian empire in the first decades of the 600’s. That left a Lydian/Median border running through the center of Asia Minor.

The Persians, under [Cyrus the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great), overthrew the Medes in 549. According to Herodotus the Lydians were unnerved by this new power on their eastern frontier: the Lydian king [Croesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croesus) struck alliances with [Nabonidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabonidus) of Babylon and [Amasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amasis_II) of Egypt as a hedge against the new Persian empire.

Lydia at this point in time was a wealthy and powerful country: “rich as Croesus” is a phrase because of the way the grandeur of the Lydian court impressed the Greeks. The Lydians subdued the Greek states in Ionia, reducing them to vassals in the early years of the sixth century BC. They also battled the Medes to a draw around the same time. So, they were — potentially at least — an important ally against the rising power of Persia.

Unfortunately for the Egyptians, the Lydians got greedy. In Herodotus’ famous story, Croesus sent to the oracle at Delphi looking for advice about how to handle the Persians:

> "Croesus, of Lydia and other countries, believing that these are the only real oracles in all the world, has sent you such presents as your discoveries deserved, and now inquires of you whether he shall go to war with the Persians, and if so, whether he shall strengthen himself by the forces of a confederate." Both the oracles agreed in the tenor of their reply, which was in each case a prophecy that if Croesus attacked the Persians, he would destroy a mighty empire, and a recommendation to him to look and see who were the most powerful of the Greeks, and to make alliance with them.

Unfortunately Croesus forgot to ask _which_  empire — after some early successes against the Persians he retired home at the end of the campaigning season, only to find himself taken unawares by the Persian armies willingness to fight in wintertime. Lydia was conquered before the Egyptians or Babylonians could intervene. The dating for this is a bit uncertain; the traditional date is 547 BC. Herodotus does claim that Croesus survived his misadventure and ended his days as a confidant of Cyrus — but Lydia was no more, and the Persian empire now stretched from Elam to the shores of the Aegean.

_Croesus about to be burned on a pyre by the victorious Persians. Legend has it that Cyrus relented at the last minute and made Croesus a trusted aide._ 

In 539, Cyrus also defeated Babylon with surprising ease — Nabonidus was unpopular with his own people and Cyrus was a canny politician who knew how to capitalized on that disaffection. With the fall of Babylon, the Persians controlled the largest empire the world had yet seen. Although Cyrus himself did not live to begin the conquest of Egypt (he died fighting in what’s now Kazhakstan in 530) the contest ahead would be entirely lopsided.

Amasis — now without major allies — scrambled to recruit help from Greece. Herodotus provides a long and rather unconvincing tale about why the Greek tyrant Polycrates of Samos abandoned Amasis when Persians were ready to invade. It’s more likely, however, that Polycrates correctly saw a losing battle ahead and decided to sail with the winds instead of against them. He sold out the Egyptians and assisted the invaders, which added a dash of gratuitous humiliation to a lopsided military victory.

All of which is a long-winded way of saying that a Hittite successor state is unlikely to have been a bigger brake on the power of Persia than the Lydians were; if anything the Lydians had a superior position behind a defensible border and with powerful allies. Of course, its possible that some alternate-universe neo-Hittite might not have had Croesus’s arrogance and shortsightedness either. However scale of Persian success by the late sixth century was so great that it would take more than a little dash of alternative history to save the Egyptians.
