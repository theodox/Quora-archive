I should probably not say it, but [tf3dm ](http://tf3dm.com)has a lot of free models. Many -- though not all -- are ripped from commercial games so tf3dm is definitely not a good place to grab models you intend to include in a commercial product of your own. If you just want good looking content to prototype or play around with, however, it's a good source. 

[Turbosquid](http://www.turbosquid.com) has quite a bit of free content nowadays as well as paid offerings. 

With all 3D content you should look for files in FBX format, which unity handles well. You can find online converters for some other formats (particularly OBJ) which will make them into FBX.
