The official script, insofar as there was one, was a __[specially-crafted cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Persian_cuneiform)__ ____ which the Persian kings commissioned. It took a subset of the ancient [cuneiform writing of Mesopotamia](https://www.quora.com/Is-cuneiform-an-alphabet/answer/Steve-Theodore) and rationalized it into a strictly phonetic system that could be used to write Persian. It’s a good thing for us they went to the trouble — it was the fairly logical Persian cuneiform which allowed 19th century scholars to begin [deciphering the vast and much more complex literature of ancient Mesopotamia,](https://www.quora.com/How-did-historians-learn-Sumerian-How-was-such-an-old-dead-language-decoded/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=6f1c236c&srid=zLvM) thanks to the familiar Indo-European structure of Old Persian.

This writing system was less of a boon for the Persians themselves, however: Old Persian Cuneiform [survives only in a few dozen examples](http://www.avesta.org/op/op.htm), mostly official inscriptions or sometimes what seem to be ownership marks on luxury items. We’ve never found a literary text, and there’s only one example of a workaday document written in OP cuneiform.

The Achaemenid administration within Iran instead used __[Elamite cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_cuneiform)__ ; the usual guess is that the Median empire used Elamite as its language of administration and the Persians continued the practice.

The habit of borrowing other people’s languages for business purposes seems to have come quite naturally to the Persians. In Babylonia the administration continued to use __Babylonian cuneiform__ . In the rest of the empire — westward to Egypt and eastward to India — the Persians used __[Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic)__ . The very scant examples we have of Persian correspondence are all in Aramaic.

Aramaic culture spread eastward with the Persian empire: when Indian emperor [Ashoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka) wanted to address his subjects in Kandahar — a Persian foundation, later occupied by Alexander — he wrote to them in [Greek and Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_Bilingual_Rock_Inscription).

There are also a handful of __Greek__ inscriptions which reflect Achaemenid agendas. For example here’s a Greek inscription from Sardis which records a Persian official dedicating a statue to Zeus:

_In the thirty-ninth year of king Artaxerxes’s reign Droaphernes, son of Barakes, hyparchos of Lydia, (consecrated) the statue to Zeus Baradateo. - He orders the (god’s) servants, who, as temple-wardens, are admitted to the innermost sanctuary and who adorn the god with a wreath, not to take part in Sabazios’s mysteries of those who bear the braziers(?), and of Angdistis and of Ma. They order the temple-warden Dorates to refrain from partaking in these mysteries. Photo and text:_ _[The Archaeological Exploration of Sardis](https://sardisexpedition.org/en/artifacts/m14-434)_
