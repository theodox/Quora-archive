In general the southern flank of the Roman empire was not militarily problematic for Rome. It doesn’t seem like any of the nations of the Sahara used dromedaries at this period — domesticated camels were known further east, in Arabia and Bactria, but there’s not a lot of evidence for widespread use in the Sahara. This meant that the desert frontier was not a serious military problem — there was no southern equivalent to the stereotypical ‘barbarian horde’ pouring out of the mists of Germany. There was a low level of conflict with the [Garamantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamantes) of modern Libya and the [Mauri ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauri_people)of modern Algeria, but these fights were on a very small scale compared to other Roman wars: they involved raids, not invasions. So, the province didn’t have a big military presence — certainly not compared to the heavily fortified frontiers on the Rhine, the Danube and the Euphrates.

Despite that, Roman Africa was _very_  important. After about the 2nd century BC Rome had grown to an incredible size for the ancient world. In the first century, the city of Rome by itself had about the same population as the entirety of Britain! But this oversized Rome was utterly unable to feed itself, and was entirely dependent on [huge grain shipments from North Africa](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-North-Africa-considered-the-breadbasket-of-the-Roman-Empire-considering-how-infertile-it-is-Was-it-just-because-of-Egypt/answer/Steve-Theodore) and Egypt. This meant that Roman Africa (the province was more or less the same as northern Tunisia) was a prosperous place. The elites of Roman “Africa” were among the wealthiest of the empire; they included the emperors of the [Severan Dynasty ](http://www.livius.org/articles/dynasty/severans/)(193–225) who were of mixed Punic, Berber and Italian ancestry. Africa was the crown jewel of the western empire — the key to the whole western economy.

This sets up the role that North Africa ended up playing in the fall of the Roman empire. As an economically vital but military weak region, it was a tempting prize. The equation first became obvious in the the year 398 with the revolt of [Gildo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gildo), a Roman-Mauri general who schemed to bring North Africa under the control of the eastern Roman emperor in Constantinople. This wasn’t a plot to destroy the Roman world — it was fairly standard stuff for the conspiracy-ridden politics of the late 4th century — but it set off a panic in Rome, which quickly realized that the city could not be fed without African grain. It also showed how threadbare the western empire’s resources has become: Gildo was ultimately defeated by his own brother [Mascezel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascezel), another local noble, not by an army dispatched from Rome.

What Gildo attempted in 398, the [Vandals](http://www.ancient.eu/Vandals/) achieved for real a generation later. The Vandals were a mix of German and Iranic peoples who invaded Gaul during the [collapse of the Rhine Frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_of_the_Rhine) in the year 406. The fought their way south and west through Gaul and Spain, and ultimately crossed the sea to land in North Africa in the year 429. They were invited into the province by another scheming Roman general, [Bonifacius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonifacius), who was trying to use the North African grain doles in his political maneuvers. Bonifacius chose poorly, however: the Vandals were only out for themselves. The threat was powerful enough to unite the eastern and western empires in an attempted counterattack — but the Vandals were too powerful and the Romans not competent enough. In 439, the Vandals captured Carthage, creating a kingdom that lasted for a hundred years.

The loss of North Africa really was the death knell of the western empire. The city of Rome — already [shocked by the attack of the Goths in 410 ](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging)— depopulated rapidly with grain in short supply. Vandal piracy seriously damaged trade throughout the western Mediterranean. The North African economy also declined — with its biggest customer in rapid decline, the aqueducts and irrigation which sustained the North African agriculture were less and less maintained. The Vandals focused on the rich prizes of the Mediterranean and neglected the interior of North Africa, so during this period man formerly Romanized towns away from the cost came under the control of the independent Mauri.

A century later, the eastern emperor [Justinian I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Justinian-I) and his brilliant general [Belisarius](http://www.ancient.eu/Belisarius/) succeeded in recapturing North Africa. By that time, though, the old Roman economy of the west was gone beyond recall. Even if there were open trade routes, Rome’s population was now less than 100,000, down from more than a million in the second and third centuries. The cities and farmlands of the coast were Roman again, but the interior was increasingly controlled by the Mauri who raided more and more aggressively. Agriculture and population in the region declined sharply. When the Arab armies arrived in 665 the province was a shrunken remnant of its former glories, and over time the influx of Arab pastoralists transformed the region beyond recognition.
