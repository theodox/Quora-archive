# Are there any historical figures whose existence is not disputed, but was only written generation after they lived by non-eyewitnesses, in other words comparable to Jesus?

The problem is how to pick just one; examples are legion.

Just to pick a name at near-random consider this old Britannica article on [Hieronymus of Cardia](https://theodora.com/encyclopedia/h2/hieronymus_of_cardia.html). There are more famous names you could pick for shock value. Hieronymus is interesting because he’s so ordinary: certainly not a member of the anonymous masses, but a routine example of how ancient historians deal with material.

Hieronymus is not a household name, but among historians he’s known for several things. He was an eyewitness to the campaigns of Alexander the Great, but he lived to the age of 104 — long enough to record the first battle between a Roman army and a Hellenistic kingdom. He was a friend and confidant of kings and commanders during the chaotic aftermath of Alexander the Great’s death. He was a military governor in Greece. He managed the asphalt industry on the Dead Sea. Above all, he is regarded as a key source for many of the most of the history of the years 320–270 BCE. He’s also a prime authority for Plutarch’s famous biographies of [Eumenes](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/eumenes*.html), [Demetrius Poliorcetes](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Demetrius*.html#39), and [Pyrrhus](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/pyrrhus*.html). In fact, he’s often cited as the first Greek to write about the rise of Rome.

On the other hand Dionysius Halicarnassus — writing during the reign of Augustus — called him “a historian no one bothers to finish.” He’s everywhere without being personally a key historical figure.

However:

The bit about him being 104 at the age of his death comes from another author whose work is also lost: [Agatharcides of Cnidus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatharchides)who lived roughly sometime in the later 2d century BC — born probably three generations after Hieronymus’ death. We know he discussed Hieronymus because he, in turn, is quoted by [Lucian of Samosata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian) (~ 125–180 CE) — about 300 years after Agatharcides and over 400 from Hieronymus.

The oldest surviving work that refers to Hieronymus by name is that of “a certain person named Moschion” who probably would have lived a bit before Agatharcides, writing in Sicily — 750 miles or more from where Hieronymus lived and worked and maybe 75 years after his death. The only thing we know about Moschion is the handful of his pages quoted by [Athenaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenaeus), about 450 years after Hieronymus.

There’s no reference to Hieronymus in any Latin source, despite his reputation as an early reporter of Rome. The reference to him being the first Greek to write about Rome comes from [Dionysius of Halicarnassus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus), writing about 250 years after Hieronymus’ death.

Key biographical details — his relationship with Eumenes, his work for the Antigonid dynasty, and his governorship — only show up in Plutarch, 350 years after Hieronymus’ day.

The history for which he is famous is lost; it exists only in paraphrases or name-checks by later writers. Although there are several facts _attributed_ to him, there is no verbatim quote of anything the wrote. It’s a commonplace among historians that Hieronymus is the main source for much of what is interesting and detailed in the work of [Diodorus of Sicily,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus) who wrote 200 years or more after Hieronymus’ death. Diodorus tends to be somewhat wordy and diffuse, but when he covers the age of Hieronymus he suddenly becomes more detail oriented, has interesting anecdotes, and provides reasonable numbers; this is all assumed to come from Hieronymus. However, although Diodorus does refer to Hieronymus (for example, he tells the story of [Diodorus’ job in the asphalt bureau in book 19](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/19E*.html#94)) he never explicitly quotes him. The common assumption is that big chunks of books 18–20 are basically plagiarized from Hieronymus — but naturally, Diodorus doesn’t tell us this himself.

He’s not quoted by Polybius, whose account overlapped with events he wrote about. His most industrious recyclers are Diodorus and Dionysius during the transition from Roman republic to Roman empire (~200 - 250 years), and then Appian and Plutarch in the second century CE (~ 350 - 400 years).

It’s worth pointing out that not only is he not attested very close to his own lifetime — neither are many of the sources which refer to him. Agatharcides for example has no contemporary mentions[ ](http://www.attalus.org/names/a/agatharchides.html)— he’s cited by Diodorus, and by early Roman-era writers but none closer to him than a couple of generations. Diodorus, too, isn’t referred to by his contemporaries — we have to guess when he died from the contents of his book, which does not refer to any event later than around 32 BC. At least his book survives him — about a third of it, anyway. The last complete copy was destroyed during the Turkish sack of Constantinople. There is no evidence for him that does not come from his own writings, and the oldest explicit quotation from him is from Athenaeus in the latter half of the second century CE, over 200 years from his own time.

Of the people mentioned in this piece by name Plutarch, Appian, Athenaeus, and — of course — emperor Augustus are attested by contemporary sources and known by any other means than their own writings. Only Augustus and Plutarch are known from physical objects (the latter from a single inscription). There is an inscription from Diodorus’ hometown in the name of a Diodorus; we have no way of knowing if it’s the same Diodorus and it offers no clue to the date.

This is how a fairly famous person — a widely cited author, diplomat, and friend of kings — fares in the sources. He’s a figure who is completely familiar to ancient historians; if anything they are often over-eager to spot traces of him — he is almost universally assumed to be the source of most of the interesting and detailed bits of Diodorus and Dionysius in the the era of Alexander’s successors. He routinely shows up in any discussion of the early historiography of Rome.

But — as you can see — he does not pass the contemporary mention test by a country mile.

Perhaps this is appropriate to the first historian to mention Rome, since effectively _no Roman who lived before the second Punic War does either_ , apart from a lucky handful whose tombstones proved particularly durable. As was said at the outset, examples are not hard to come by.

The paraphrases by other authors are cataloged in the _Fragmente Der Griechischen Historiker_  volume 2B (this link needs a free account before you can ‘borrow’ the book for an hour). This also contains the complete ancient accounts of all mentions of Hieronymus (in German and Greek — there’s an English edition but it’s not available online)
