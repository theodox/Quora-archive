Well, Punic — which is usually described as a distinct language after about the seventh century BC — definitely lasted well past the end of the Carthaginian empire. Here’s a very public example, a bilingual inscription from Leptis Magna in Tunisia with Latin on the top and Punic below, dedicated by _Annobal Rufus ornator patriae amator concordiae_  : “Hannibal the Red, enhancer of his country and lover of peace”

Punic remained a living language down to the end of the Roman period in North Africa. Emperor [Septimius Severus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus)came from a Punic speaking family, and Saint Augustine was at least passingly familiar with Punic literature in the 5th century.

Augustine is the last surviving mention of Punic as a living language. It’s often assumed that the semitic roots of Punic made Arabization easier after the Arab conquest, but we don’t have any real evidence for this.
