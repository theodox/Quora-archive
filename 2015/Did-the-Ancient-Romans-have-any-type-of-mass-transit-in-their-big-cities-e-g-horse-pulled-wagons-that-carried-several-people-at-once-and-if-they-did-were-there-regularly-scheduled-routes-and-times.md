# Did the Ancient Romans have any type of mass transit in their big cities, e.g., horse pulled wagons that carried several people at once, and if they did, were there regularly scheduled routes and times?

There were pay-for-hire carriages, but these were more like taxis than buses: they were pay-for-hire or rental affairs and did not run on regular routes. Part of the reason was, as has been noted, the absence of a 'commute': most people lived near their work. Only a rich minority could afford what we would call as 'suburban' lifestyle outside the city proper, and these usually travelled by sedan chairs rather than wheeled vehicles.

Wheeled transportation was forbidden inside the city during the daytime by Caesar to cut down on traffic accidents. Later emperors banned horse riding inside the city as well, partly to allow flow of pedestrians and partly for sanitary reasons.

The legal limit on cart payloads was 1,000 pounds, so six or eight passengers would have been the upper limit in any case: [Roads in Ancient Rome](http://www.crystalinks.com/romeroads.html)
