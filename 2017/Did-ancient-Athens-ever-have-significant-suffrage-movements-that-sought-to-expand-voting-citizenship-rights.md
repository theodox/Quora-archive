Most ancient city states had property qualifications for voting. So, for example, when Athens first became a republic under [Draco ](http://www.ancient.eu/Dracos_Law_Code/)(~ 620 BC) political rights were limited entirely to those who could fight in the city militia, which is to say those who could afford the full suit of arms and armor: way beyond the reach of even a prosperous smallholder or craftsman.

That lasted about a generation, but the political disadvantages of everybody except the aristocrats led to a crisis and the threat of civil war. The reformer [Solon](http://www.ancient.eu/solon/) (~594 BC) devised a constitution which created four classes of citizenship, extended to include the rest of the free male citizen body. The most important posts (military commands, the archonship, and membership in the _[Boule](http://www.agathe.gr/democracy/the_boule.html)_ __ (“Senate”) were still restricted to aristocrats from the two uppermost classes. The third class, the _zeugitai_ , was still drawn from the ranks of potential infantrymen, but the property qualification was much lower; they could hold only lower-ranking offices. The fourth class, the _thetes_ , were citizens too poor to serve as hoplites; they could vote in the assembly or as jurors in a law-court, but could not hold any other offices.

This defused tensions for a while, but from 546 to 510 the city was ruled by the tyrant [Peisistratus](http://www.agathe.gr/democracy/tyranny.html) and his sons. “Tyrant” in Greek doesn’t mean exactly what it does in English, a tyrant was most often a kind populist opponent of the aristocracy rather than a totalitarian (although the two are not mutually exclusive).

When the Peisistratids were driven out for good in 510, they city was split between the aristocrats (who spearheaded the resistance to the tyrants) and the lower classes who had, in many cases, supported them. The conflict sparked a botched aristocratic coup supported by Sparta; but when that was put down a new compromise system was engineered by [Cleisthenes](http://www.ancient.eu/Cleisthenes/) in 508. This system was deliberately designed to break up the power of the aristocratic clans; it centered more influence local groupings (the _[demes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deme)_ _)_ and, more importantly, opened up the _Boule_  to all citizens as nominated by the demes.

Over the next generation the newly-empowered commoners took more and more power into their own hands. Increasingly offices were awarded by lot rather than by election, ensuring that anybody could be a magistrate regardless of either social class or political influence.

Interestingly that expansion of popular power led to a noticeable contraction in openness to outsiders — Athens was less willing to let resident aliens acquire citizenship than other Greek cities. Under Pericles (~ 451) the assembly restricted citizenship only to those who were the children of two citizens (so the children of an Athenian married to a Theban or a Spartan would not be Athenian citizens). When Pericles son by his first wife died he himself had to beg an exception to the law for his own son, [Pericles the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles_the_Younger), whose mother was Milesian.

As for agitation concerning women’s suffrage, we don’t have any record of such a thing — unless you count Aristophanes’ plays [Lysistrata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysistrata), whose plot centers on a sex-strike by the women of Athens intended to force the city to abandon the war against Sparta, and the [Thesmophoriazusae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesmophoriazusae) which depicts a female secession movement. These are both comedies, of course, and part of the joke was supposed to be how ‘absurd’ it would be if women took on roles in politics — but they also show that the established order wasn’t beyond question or completely non-negotiable. Plato proposed a unisex caste system in the Republic, but that was more influenced by the example of Spartan training than by egalitarianism
