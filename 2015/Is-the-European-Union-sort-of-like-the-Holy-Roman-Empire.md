I think [Christian Benesch](https://www.quora.com/profile/Christian-Benesch) has the gist of it: the similarity really arises from the fact that both are 'aspirational' polities rather than hard-nosed, facts-on-the-ground kind of states... although to be fair the contemporary EU has vastly more influence in the daily lives of its citizens than the HRE ever did -- even an ambiguous quasi-state in the 21st century has powers and resources undreamed of by Charlemagne.

In another way the EU is really an attempt to _undo_  the worst legacy of the HRE. The [three-way division of the empire in 841](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Verdun) created a strange political fault line in the history of western Europe.

 The central stripe of the post-Carolingian map, the ill-fated kingdom of [Lotharingia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotharingia), was straddled a number of cultural and economic divides and was terribly situated to defend itself or to unify it's peoples. The former Lotharingian territories remained a zone of conflict and competition throughout European history: it's not an accident that that most French of symbols, the cross of Lorraine:

 is also a symbol of _Lothringen_ in the [Wehrmacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/79th_Infantry_Division_(Wehrmacht)):

The map of Lotharingia is also a map of some of the key rivalries of Europe: Frank and Saxon, Austrian and Italian, and eventually and most destructively French and German.

 So the EU -- born out of WWII and the hope of unifying the continent -- owes its existence to the fragmentation of the HRE only two generations after its birth under Charlemagne. Even today there are -- well buried, thankfully-- underlying tensions along the old border, whether in [Alsace/Lothringen](http://www.lothringen.com/) or in [Lombardy and Piedmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord).
