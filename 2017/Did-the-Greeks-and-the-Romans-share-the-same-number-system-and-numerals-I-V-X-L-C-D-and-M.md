The both used the same general idea, substituting alphabetical characters for numerals. But the Greeks, not surprisingly, used the Greek alphabet instead of the Roman one.

The Romans seem to have gotten their numerical system from the Greeks, which make sense since the Romans originally got their letters from Greeks. For ordinary usage — like accounting or simple counting tasks — the Greeks used a very similar system:

The rules were similar but not exactly the same; the Greeks didn’t use the Roman habit of counting backwards so 9 would be ΠΙΙΙI rather than ΙΔ.

The Greeks actually had a couple of other systems as well. As you can see from this table, often the Greeks would use more of the alphabet rather than multiple letters of the MCMLXIV variety.

There were also different specialty systems for things like astronomy (which, following the Babylonians, used base 60 instead of base 10).
