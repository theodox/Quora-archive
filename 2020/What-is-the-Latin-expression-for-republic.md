There’s a false-friend in _res publica_ or sometimes the compound word _respublica._ 

In Latin _res_  has an odd double meaning — it can mean “business” or “affairs” but it also means “wealth” or “treasure”. Thus early modern authors, who knew their Latin well, designated their efforts at non-monarchical government as “commonwealths” in English.

Strictly speaking, though, Latin _respublica_ does not actually refer to the distinction between communal self government and monarchy. An imperial era Roman could un-selfconsciously refer to the absolute monarchy in which he lived as the _respublica_ without feeling any incongruity. The emphasis was on the _publica,_ the fact that “affairs” were being administered on behalf of the common good and not for personal gain. Even Cicero — who lost his life in the struggle against the rise of monarchism in Rome— could say

> a _res publica_  (that is the concern of the people) then truly exists when its affairs are conducted well and justly, whether by a single king, or by a few aristocrats, or by the people as a whole

This is why pre-modern English (such as Chaucer) translated _respublica_ as _commonweal_  rather than _commonwealth_ , with _[weal](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/weal)_ representing the idea of “wellbeing” as much as “economic prosperity.” Essentially a _respublica_  is a legitimate government (as opposed to, say, the military takeovers which Cicero fought against) but it could be a legitimate monarchy or a well-run moderate aristocracy.

The opposite of _res publica_  is not _regnum,_ monarchy, but _tyrannis_ , rule by force — which could come from the masses (_tyrannis populi)_ as well as from an individual.

If a Roman wanted to distinguish elective government from monarchy they’d have to resort to a circumlocution, something like _civitas popularis,_ “government by the citizenry” or _civitas optimatium,_ “government by the upper classes” for an aristocratic government.
