In this regard, Seattle is very much like the Midwest where the "good school" is also the "state school". UW has the best business and professional networks in Washington by far, though there's a certain degree of traditional rivalry with WSU ("Dawgs" vs "Cougs" is a pretty basic divide in Washington). The different campuses have different reputations, with the Seattle campus being the capstone.

We are pretty far, physically and emotionally from the East Coast college rat race; while UW is on top of the local heap we are generally much less obsessed with the finely tuned social-status value attached to different schools back east (how does Tufts score vs Brandeis? Rutgers vs UVA? etc.) We are as likely to be impressed by a Stanford/Ivy/MIT degree as anyone else.
