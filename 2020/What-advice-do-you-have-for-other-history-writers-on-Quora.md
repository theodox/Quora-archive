The first thought which leaped into my mind is not exactly a writing tip: it’s more like self-help advice.

__Pick your battles__ 

When you happen to have some specialist information about a topic, it’s easy to get sucked into a never-ending stream of questions on the same subject matter. If your answers often involve trying to reframe common misconceptions — I'm looking at you, [Library of Alexandria](https://www.quora.com/topic/Library-of-Alexandria) — you can easily end up in a frustrating place. You get peppered with slight variations on the same inquiry, often one you've already tried to correct many times before. That tempts you into snippiness or sarcasm, which is a disservice to the questioners but also to your own writing: it’s easy to see how many otherwise useful answers are marred by sneering and condescension, and it’s important to remember that you’re not immune.

The inherently inhuman scale of the internet reinforces this dynamic powerfully: I can't get through a weekend without seeing yet another questioner trotting out another variation on "would we have flying cars yet if _<people I don't like>_  hadn't burned down the library of Alexandria?" This makes _me_ gnash my teeth — but, in fairness, the average asker hasn’t suffered through all of that. They just want an answer. It's not fair to either of us if I engage with the question from the standpoint of my own irritation. Sometimes the best way to win is not to play. This is not, after all, a paid job: if your answers just make you angry, why bother?

> _Incidentally, Quora Inc: Better tools for merging and redirecting questions would have an outsized impact on the tone of the site for this very reason. I frequently find it a huge chore to redirect a clearly derivative question, even when I’m pointing to a question I have already answered. That, plus the fairly frequent un-merges adds up to a lot of writer fatigue and questioner-blaming._ 



While some aspects of Quora writing can be frustrating, a would-be historian can always fall back on the essence of the craft:

__Love your sources__ 

If you’ve spent any time in academic history circles, it’s easy to get caught up in the wrangling of the various scholarly factions. Most readers here, though, don’t want footnote-by-footnote throw-downs between specialists. They (we) are _tourists_ in the exotic foreign country that is the past.__ And tourism is different from reading tour guides: it’s experiential.

Knowing and sharing your source material — the actual primary stuff, not just the professional summaries — is the key to impactful historical writing. Well-chosen originals put the past in all of its [weird, alien glory](https://www.quora.com/What-would-ancient-Greeks-from-the-different-cities-have-given-to-their-lovers-as-interest-gifts-or-love-tokens/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=ccf41c0a&srid=zLvM) front and center. Good “anecdata” also make you look smart for little extra effort; you can happily recycle the insights, the pathos, or the sheer oddity of your subjects. Sometimes you just want to step back and let the past speak for itself. Many questions want you to be the emcee and not the star of the show.

> _Ah, cut and paste, how I love thee! Spare a thought, passersby, for the poor suckers who had to do it all with nought but index cards and inter-library loan._ 

Of course, any aspiring history writer here should be familiar enough with the academic work to follow the arguments and separate the insightful wheat from the specious chaff. Still, under-the-hood minutiae struggle to find an audience. That doesn’t mean it’s not fun to write[ a tight little answer about something really obscure](https://www.quora.com/When-was-the-death-of-Sidonius-Apollinaris/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=79133cb8&srid=zLvM). However, that’s a different (and much less popular) genre than long-form history writing as practiced here. A good Quora answer is respectful of scholarly disagreements and the nuances of the sources but doesn’t drag the audience down into the academic underworld without good reason. Sometimes, [the only way to answer a question is to put things into proper monographic form](https://www.quora.com/A-Quoran-archaeologist-historian-argues-there-is-no-textual-evidence-for-a-Christian-theological-tradition-in-the-West-prior-to-the-life-of-Alcuin-735-804-CE-and-that-earlier-Christian-history-is-a-fiction-Is-there/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=f82d439c&srid=zLvM) — but those situations are vastly outnumbered by cases where a [succinctly told story ](https://www.quora.com/On-his-death-bed-heirless-Alexander-the-Great-was-asked-Who-shall-have-the-empire-And-he-replied-To-the-Strongest-Which-of-his-generals-should-have-ruled/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=cff12101&srid=zLvM)or just some [scene-setting](https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Persians-fall-into-the-Hellenic-trap-at-Salamis/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=b9803db3&srid=zLvM) is all the question really needs.

Devotion to the sources has another side benefit: it keeps you on your toes. I know that many of my best reading experiences here come from answers which I didn't buy in their entirety but which nonetheless contained pieces of information that I felt compelled to assimilate on my own terms. Clear, carefully chosen and well-sourced data are very powerful, because (unlike mere verbiage) they are hard to ignore. This is where the kinds of things you learned in a college class really do matter: making a case is all about marshaling your evidence carefully.

Curating your source material also helps you avoid devolving into another internet jerk. [Channeling your historiographic frustrations into a barrage of well-sourced evidence ](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-about-the-theory-of-Marshall-Zhukov-that-Alexander-had-been-defeated-in-India/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=8862e226&srid=zLvM)is far healthier than concocting elegant sneers. Of course, the concomitant to that is that you can’t go cooking the books on your own behalf: when you catch yourself deliberately omitting or downplaying evidence that makes your key contentions look bad, it might be time to go outside for a walk instead of muttering to yourself over the keyboard at 2 a.m.



In classic college essay fashion, one leaves the best for last. The big tip, the most important thing, is both completely banal and altogether indispensable.

__Don’t write: edit!__ 

Nobody’s a great writer on their first draft. It’s fine to bang out a quick answer to a simple question on your phone while waiting for the bus, but trying to write historical narrative or an interpretive essay is not like drafting a quick email. Conveying complex ideas in text form is hard; give yourself time to get it right, and that means editing.

Thankfully, this isn’t homework; you don’t need outlines and predictable topic sentences and all that folderol. What you do need, however, is to separate out conception, execution and presentation. I change my own mind in mid-stream all the time. Sometimes my pat one-sentence answer turns out to be bunkum. Sometimes I realize my evidence points the wrong way and I need to re-contextualize it. Mostly, I re-read what I’ve written and blanch in terror that I might have accidentally clicked _Submit_  while that dreck was still on the page.

You can almost never go wrong by re-reading your own work a few times: first to make sure that it makes sense, then to see that it flows well, and finally to catch all of the run-on sentences, pointless passive constructions, and dreary repetitions that bespatter every first draft. Everything matters, from the grandest argumentative construct to deciding where to put a paragraph break.

> _Having dispensed all of the sage advice I’m going to hit ‘save draft’ and walk away for a few hours. Even with that done, I’ll probably take a look after it goes up and immediately spot something stupid which I’ll have to fix after the fact. Paid writers (those astonishingly rare creatures) have editors for a reason!_ 

OK, I’m back. And I’ve removed a paragraph, added some illustrative links, and gotten rid of several awkward phrasings. I trimmed out a few reflexive cliches. Above all I turned half a dozen paragraph-devouring runons into twenty or so simple sentences. But — since you weren’t here — it all looks effortless! Nothing will improve your writing a tenth as much as the willingness to step away from the keyboard and return with a set of fresh eyes.
