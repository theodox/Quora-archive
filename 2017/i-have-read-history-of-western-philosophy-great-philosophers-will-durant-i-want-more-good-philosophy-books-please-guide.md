You might try the series that starts with this one: [A History of Philosophy, Vol. 1: Greece and Rome From the Pre-Socratics to Plotinus](http://amzn.to/2v4MNO2) Evidently you can’t buy it in one go. It’s very comprehensive up through the 60’s and generally does a better job on things before about 1700 than Durant does.

It’s 9 volumes in all
