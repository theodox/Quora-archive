No, Sumeria is _in_  Mesopotamia but it only covers about the southern third of the wider area.

Sumeria refers to the historical heartland of the Sumerian culture — the first urban culture in the Near East. A number of Sumerian city-states flourished from about 3000 to 2000 BC in the southern part of what’s now Iraq. By the end of that period the Sumerians lost their political independence to a variety of outsiders, though Sumerian language would live on for almost another two thousand years as a key part of religion and literature all over Mesopotamia — somewhat in the the way Latin outlasted the Roman Empire in Europe.
