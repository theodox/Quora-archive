From one perspective, Sparta was a typical Greek city state: The citizens -- men with enough property to support themselves on campaign with the city militia -- voted on the laws and elected annual magistrates to (the [ephors ](http://www.britannica.com/topic/ephor)) who administered the city; non-citizens included both slaves and free people below the property qualification for military service. This vague description would also apply to pretty much everywhere else in the Greek world, from Thebes to Corinth to the Greek colonies in Africa, Italy or Gaul.

However in most ways Sparta was a utterly distinctive*.

Unlike the common Greek city Sparta was a highly militarized colonial state: an armed camp in the middle of a restive native population. The Spartans claimed to be the [children of Hercules](http://children of Hercules), descendants of the semi-legendary conquerors of Greece. It's not clear to modern scholarship if the legends represent and actual conquest by outsiders (the so-called [Dorian invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_invasionif) ) or if that was made-up after the fact -- but it is clear that Sparta and several other Greek city-states had ruling classes that viewed themselves as socially and ethnically distinct from a serf-like lower class and asserted their privileges by right of conquest; you can think of this something like the distinction between Normans and Saxons in medieval England.

In most of Greece, the distinction between the 'conquerors' and the 'conquered' of this was a matter of social prestige or historical curiosity: but in Sparta it was a matter of life or death.** The vast bulk of the population of Sparta were εἵλωτες or _[helots](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/helot/)_ _:_ essentially serfs, tied to the land and forced to work for the benefit of their Spartan masters; they spoke a different dialect and had different religious practices than their masters. Living as a tiny minority ruling a large and unhappy population of helots, the Spartans were obsessed with the fear of revolt. This turned Sparta into an armed camp: in fact every year the Spartans ritually "declared war" on their helots and sent the _[Crypteia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypteia)_ _,_ a kind of paramilitary death-squad, to terrorize them and kill any helots who looked like a threat to the established order.

To keep their power, the Spartans devoted themselves to warfare. The militarization of Spartan society was very, very complete. Like medieval knights or Samurai, the main profession of all Spartans was warfare. Constant training and discipline were the ordinary occupations of a Spartan citizen; agriculture and manual labor was left in the hand of the helots. A strict... or maybe more accurately a _brutal_  training regime known as the _[Agoge](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-training-regimen-of-a-spartan-soldier-like)_  started at age 7 for every male citizen. All male citizens ate in communal mess-halls, _[Syssitia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syssitia)_ _,_ which were organized like wartime units. The only profession allowed to a male Spartiate was to be a soldier.

Many laws and customs were designed to keep Spartans focused on military preparedness. What little trade or craft work was done was usually delegated to a group of second-class citizens known as [Periokoi](http://Periokoi). The only legal currency was clumsy iron ingots: useless outside of Sparta and too clunky to sell as a commodity outside the city. Every Spartan was given ownership of one or more farms --- complete with serfs -- to assure that they had the resources to devote themselves exclusively to military service. Strict laws against displays of wealth tended to prevent arts and crafts from advancing -- the Spartans were famous for their music and poetry but left almost no visual art or architecture worthy of mention.

Interestingly, this highly repressive military state was also the most favorable to women (Aristotle famously [blamed the decline of Sparta on the amount of freedom given to women](http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/aristotle-spartanwomen.asp)). Unlike women in the rest of Greece, Spartan women could own property. Like the men they exercised naked in the gymasium and competed in athletic contests. They were also encouraged to take 'temporary husbands' when their men were away on campaign in order to keep up the population of full Spartans (keeping the Spartiate ranks filled was a constant problem, since the xenophobic Spartans rarely recruited newcomers and the rigors of their martial life constantly depleted their numbers).

Sparta, almost unique among Greek cities also had hereditary monarchy; in fact it had _two._ The Spartans had two ruling houses (the [Eurypontids and the Agiads](http://www.livius.org/articles/dynasty/eurypontids-and-agiads/)), each of whose eldest male in the direct line was a βασιλεύς _(Basileus)_  or 'king', although even in classical times it was known as a very old title that was otherwise obsolete in the Greek world. The Kings were the most important priests of the city religion and also led the city's army on the battlefield: ordinarily one king would stay behind while the other was on campaign. The kings were not -- usually -- the real rulers of the city; the elected ephors made most of the policy decisions and there was a shadowy unelected council of elders which tended to keep Spartan policy very consistent from behind the scenes. However many kings used their highly visible position and traditional prestige to make themselves pre-eminent.

This very distinctive system , based on perpetual military readiness and aversion to all forms of commerce, made Sparta very powerful compared to other Greek cities; however it proved very fragile. When Spartans campaigned abroad and saw the life that was lived in other Greek cities (or wealthier places, like the Persian empire) they often came home discontented and resentful to the strict equality and discipline of Sparta. Many famous Spartan commanders ended up in disgrace for becoming corrupted by foreign luxuries ambitions, notably [Pausanias](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/pausanias) and [Lysander](http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lysander.html). Although Sparta won the [Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War) against Athens, its xenophobic and almost paranoid culture made it an unpopular superpower and its dominance lasted scarcely one generation ( see [What happened to Sparta?](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-Sparta))

_* The closest match for Sparta's unique system was in Crete, whose rulers also claimed descent from the children of Heracles._ 

_** The city of Sicyon, seems to have had a revolution in which the natives overthrew and enslaved their one-time conquerors: precisely the situation the Spartans lived in fear of. See_ _[Cleisthenes of Sicyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleisthenes_of_Sicyon)_
