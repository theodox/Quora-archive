Part of it is straight-up history: As far as we can reconstruct it, Greek drama evolved out of what amounts to liturgical readings: the re-enactment of important scenes from the mythical past staged as a key part of the religious celebration. They originated as hymns with a counterpoise between a soloist and a chorus and gradually acquired more speaking parts and movement. The odd etymology of the word _tragedy_  --from τράγος, "goat" and ἀείδω, "sing" reflects a close association with the ritual of sacrifice. Goats were closely associated with Dionysus -- his primary servants were goat-legged [satyrs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr) and he himself was sometimes known as Ειραφιωτης "the goat-kid;" goat sacrifices (torn limb from limb, like a character from the Bacchae) were a key part of the ritual.

 _Dionysus with satyrs. Word to the wise: image googling of 'Dionysus' and 'goat' is NSFW_ 

That said, its' also probably worth noting that the Dionysia reflected two very different aspects of Greek culture: it was simultaneously "Bacchanalian" in the Animal House toga party sense and intensely serious, being one of the few elements in classical Greek religion that actually spoke to the individual directly rather than catering to the needs of the city. 


Dionysiac religion operated right at the fulcrum of the difficult balancing act which obsessed the Greeks -- the tension between desire and consequences, which was inescapable in such a tightly knit society: what Nietzsche called the [Apollonian and Dionysian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_and_Dionysian) halves of the Greek psyche. There was a huge psychological distance between all those Delphic maxims about the golden mean, and nothing to excess on the one hand and the messy realities of life in a tightly packed small town where everybody knew everybody else, old feuds ran on for generations, and politics had a habit of ending in bloodshed. 

The controlled ecstasy of the Dionysia was -- like the Roman Saturnalia, or a medieval Carnival -- a kind of safety valve for some of those tension. To some degree that was just a lot of public drunkenness and a rare chance for the women (usually cooped up in a _gynaceum)_  to get out in the streets and live it up a little. But it was also quite deliberately perceived as a time for reflection as well. The entertainments were very precisely targeted at those terrible small-town tensions and their possible consequences. The epitome of that whole thing is the weird disconnect between the two sides of Dionysus in _[The Bacchae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bacchae)_ _,_ where he is _described_  as being a lover and a partier but where he _acts_ like Keyser Soze. The tragedy of Oedipus is another example: a meditation of the difference between the standard Olympian view ("wrong" is whatever the guy with the lightning bolt says) and a view of moral responsibility based on personal intent and human judgement.

 _Pentheus found out what happens when you are deaf to the emotions_ 

Seen this way it also makes sense that the tragedies are book-ended by the comedies: it was a time and place where people could go public with complaints and critiques that had no obvious place in the tightly wound, intensely political day-to-day world.
