[Jeff](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jeff-3730)’s answer is great. I just thought I’d add a little on the culture of drunkenness and the strength of Greek wines.

We don’t know exactly how strong Greek wine was but some people think it was stronger than most modern versions (among other things it was harvested late and had a lot of sugar). The strong-wine theory is supported by the fact that the Greeks thought drinking unmixed wine was uncivilized. Greeks liked to retell the story of [Brennus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brennus_(3rd_century_BC)), a Celtic or Gaulish chieftain who led his tribes in an attack on Greece and Greek Asia minor — wounded in a by the Greek defenders, he killed himself in the eminently barbaric manner by [drinking undiluted wine](https://atlanticreligion.com/2014/06/17/279-brennus-and-the-mystery-of-the-undiluted-wine/). Alexander and his Macedonians were regarded as very wild for indulging in unmixed wines. The modern Greek word for wine, κρασι, derives from the ancient Greek word for “mixing”.

The ratio of wine to water was a key part of Greek party planning. 3 parts water to 1 of wine was considered moderate; 2:1 was a very social mix, and 1:1 was the Greek equivalent of a spring-break drink: the aim was to get drunk quickly, decorum be damned. This suggests, again, that Greek wine was either much stronger or perhaps partially dehydrated; most modern wines would not survive a 3:1 water mix.

A Greek comic poet, [Eubulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eubulus_(poet)), listed the effect of wine on people by serving (a _krater_  is the common mixing-and-drinking vessel from which the guests would be served, about ).

“I mix three kraters only for those who are wise.

One is for good health, which they drink first.

The second is for love and pleasure.

The third is for sleep, and when they have drunk it those who are wise wander homewards.

The fourth is no longer ours, but belongs to arrogance.

The fifth leads to shouting.

The sixth to a drunken revel.

The seventh to black eyes.

The eighth to a court appearance.

The ninth to throwing up.

The tenth to madness, it makes people throw things.”
