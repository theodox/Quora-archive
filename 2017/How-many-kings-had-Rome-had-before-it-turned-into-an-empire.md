The traditional answer is seven:

[Romulus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus)

[Numa Pompilius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numa_Pompilius)

[Tullus Hostilius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullus_Hostilius)

[Ancus Marcius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancus_Marcius)

[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Priscus)

[Servius Tullius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servius_Tullius)

[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus)

All of them are frequently described as “legendary”, though they gradually get more plausible as you go down the list. Almost nobody regards Romulus as a literal historical figure, while most people see a later king like Servius Tullius as a historic character who accumulated some legendary attributes.

According to tradition the last king, Tarquinius, was [overthrown by Lucius Junius Brutus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overthrow_of_the_Roman_monarchy) in 509 BC. The dramatic details of that event clearly involve some element of folklore — it predates any written Roman history — but the tradition is fairly solid and usually regarded as essentially historic.
