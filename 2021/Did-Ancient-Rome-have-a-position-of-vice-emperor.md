After a fashion, yes. It was pretty common for an older emperor to publicly embrace a younger colleague as a way of pre-empting possible challenges to a succession. Eventually this turned into an explicit (though not very long-lived) system in which the two co-emperors of the east and the west each had a designated “junior” emperor.

The secondary-emperor tradition evolved in fits and starts, it was not the product of systematic reform. The earliest example is probably that of [Nerva](https://www.ancient.eu/Nerva/), who adopted [Trajan](https://www.ancient.eu/trajan/) as his personal and political heir (the impulse probably owed a lot to the fact that Nerva was a civilian politician and Trajan a popular and powerful general — in the hardball politics of first century Rome this was a very canny move). All of the so-called “five good emperors” used this system to forestall disputed successions. Typically the heir-designate didn’t occupy the same legal position as the reigning emperor but was clearly and publicly the number two man. The last of them, [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius) — despite his reputation as a philosopher — however made the bad call of inviting his wastrel son [Commodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus) to rule as co-emperor in 177.

When Diocletian finally ended the disastrous series of civil wars that nearly killed the empire in the third century, he reorganized the imperial office with the intention of completely clarifying the transmission of power. His system, known as the [Tetrarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrarchy) gave each half of the emperor a “senior emperor”, bearing the title of _Augustus_ , and a “junior emperor” under the title of _Caesar._ The idea was that the Caesar of each half would succeed the corresponding Augustus and then pick a new Caesar as his own successor. Unfortunately the idea didn’t really catch on, and within a generation had restored the traditional sole-emperor system again.
