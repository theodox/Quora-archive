This is an NSFW answer, and a bit… wierd.

Egyptian lettuce tends to ooze a milky substance if you break a stalk. This was somewhat, uh, _suggestive_ to ancient Egyptian minds.

_Here’s a pharoah (at right) offering two heads of lettuce (Egyptian style lettuce, like romaine, is tall rather than round) to the fertility god_ _[Min](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_(god))_ _— who is, in a complex roundabout way, also Horus — who responds quite visibly. From the temple of Abu Simbel. Photo:_ _[C. Rozay](https://www.voyagevirtuel.co.uk/egypt/photo/abou-simbel-n6.php)_ 

More importantly, that suggestion got included in the set of stories involving Horus, Set, Isis and Osiris. The whole thing gets complex.

Lettuce plays a key role in the interesting face-off between the rival gods Horus and Set. Set tries to claim dominion over Horus by having intercrural sex with him while he sleeps. Horus wakes up and catches his rival’s semen in his hands — but Isis is scandalized and cuts off Horus’s hands as a result. This degradation threatens Horus’s claim on the throne of Egypt. Isis, however, tricks Set into eating some of Horus’s semen hidden in a milky-lettuce leaf. This is even more emasculating — not only does the revelation of this trick scuppered Set’s claims to power, Set actually becomes pregnant and gives “birth” to a solar disk through his forehead.

This is, I should add, merely a greatest-hits reel of the Horus-Set-Isis-Osiris saga; like I said, it’s complex. You can find the whole thing [here](https://chesterbeatty.ie/assets/uploads/2018/11/The-Library-of-A.-Chestera-Beatty-Description-of-a-Hieratic-Papyrus-with-a-Mythological-Story-Love-Songs-and-Other-Miscellaneous-Texts.pdf) (though this translation is a bit elderly). If you’re a structural anthropologist there’s all sorts of deep material here regarding sexuality, fertility, intergenerational inheritance and political power. For the rest of us, it’s time for a knowing look and a subdued “uh-huh”.

The whole “sexy-lettuce” thing is also found in Mesopotamia, where you get love-poems like [this bit from Sumeria](https://resgerendae.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/the-lettuce-of-my-heart/) (it’s racier in cuneiform but you can get the gist).

> He’s sprouted! He’s burgeoned! He’s lettuce planted by the water,

> My well-stocked garden of the… plain, my darling of his mother’s womb,

> My barley-stalk luxuriant in its furrow – he’s lettuce planted by the water,

> My apple tree which bears fruit up to its top – he’s lettuce planted by the water.

> The honey-man, the honey-man does sweet things to me!

> My lord, the honey-man of the gods, my darling of his mother’s womb,

> Whose hand is honey, whose foot is honey, was doing sweet things to me!

> His limbs are honey-sweet, and he was doing sweet things to me!

> He was doing sweet things to my insides, all the way up to my navel!

> My darling of his mother’s womb,

> My […] of the fair thighs, he’s lettuce planted by the water.
