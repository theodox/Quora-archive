Yes, it’s very common.

Hollywood productions usually a mix of conventional photography and depth-sensing cameras; under controlled conditions this is extremely accurate . It’s also pretty much a commodity — if you have enough money you can just book an appointment at a place like [Eiskot](https://www.eisko.com/index.html) and get an extremely good capture.

Ordinary folks with ordinary cameras can do the same thing — but without the depth cameras the results are usually not as good since the final 3d model has to be an approximation based on the computer’s ability to match features in a number of photos. Shadows, highlights and colors in the background of a photo can confuse the results . Even so the it’s pretty amazing what you can do with just a camera and the right software. We [captured all of the characters](https://undeadlabs.com/2016/08/news/get-your-head-in-the-game/) in [State of Decay 2](https://www.stateofdecay.com/age-gate/?r=%2F) with an ordinary digital SLR camera, a few improvised bounce lights , and [Agisoft PhotoScan](http://www.agisoft.com/).

There are also [smartphone apps](https://www.aniwaa.com/best-3d-scanning-apps-smartphones/) for doing the same thing. Typically the results wont be as good as what you’d get with a bigger camera, a tripod, and controlled lighting — but it’s still pretty neat.

You can also buy fairly inexpensive depth cameras which attach to an tablet or are used on their own to do more accurate captures when the lighting is hard to control. Devices like the [Structure Sensor](https://structure.io/) are pretty capable and less vulnerable to bad lighting. If you have an Xbox One with a Kinect sensor, you can do pretty nice captures with using the Kinect as a scanner and some extra software. I recycled an old Kinect to scan my kids — it let me 3–d print Christmas ornaments of them for the grandparents.



The iPhone X uses the same kind of depth sensor to capture images. There are [already apps for scanning a face with that](https://3dscanexpert.com/3d-scan-your-face-with-the-iphone-x-and-bellus3d-app/). It’s a safe bet that this kind of tech will be pretty much everywhere inside a decade.
