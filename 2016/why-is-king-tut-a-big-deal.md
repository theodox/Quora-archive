The biggest reason is that this tomb was found almost intact, a great rarity in Egyptology.

We like to say that the ancient Egyptians had all sorts of beliefs about the pharaohs and the afterlife and cosmic order — but tomb robbery was big, big business in ancient Egypt, throughout antiquity.

_A fraction of the_ _[Amherst Papyrus:](http://america.pink/amherst-papyrus_368520.html)_ _a court transcript from the trial of tomb robbers under Ramses IX (about 200 years after Tut)_ 

Besides the obvious theft of gold and precious objects, the robbers were just as destructive (and prone to casual vandalism) as their modern counterparts.

_The robbers of_ _[Tomb 10A](http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/4283)_ _just threw aside the wooden and clay objects they didn’t care about — which had the side effect of preserving them for later archaeologists._ 

Tut’s tomb actually was robbed — [in fact, it was robbed twice,](http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/tutrobbery.htm) the first time within a few years of its completion.

However the authorities seem to have caught at least one band of the robbers and repaired and re-sealed the tomb. The incredible richness of the tomb isn’t, in fact, complete — according to inventories at the site, about two-thirds of the jewelry interred with the king is gone. However it’s still far a greater treasure than anything found in one place elsewhere in Egypt. More importantly, its generally good condition gives a far better picture of Pharaonic life than any other find.

Besides the drama and obvious appeal of the precious contents, the contents have an immediacy that can’t be matched. In the century since Tut’s tomb was opened we’ve only found [one other intact tomb](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4700032.stm) — which, evidently, was a re-burial of mummies to protect them from robbers.



Besides the treasure, Tut is also an important historical figure. His predecessor, [Akhenaten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten), is one of the most interesting and unusual of Pharaohs; his reign was a time of religious and cultural upheaval which pitted the untraditional pharaoh against the traditional Egyptian elites. Tut was the figurehead of the restoration: taking the throne at only 9, his reign saw the re-establishment of the traditional order and the undoing of Akhenaten’s revolution.
