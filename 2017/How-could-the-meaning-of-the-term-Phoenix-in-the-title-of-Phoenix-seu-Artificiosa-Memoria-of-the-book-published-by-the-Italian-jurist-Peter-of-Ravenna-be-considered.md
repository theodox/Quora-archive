Any educated Latin-speaking person in the Middle Ages will have been familiar with the phoenix both as a part of ancient legend and as a religious allegory. The story about the bird which is reborn from its own ashes is very old one, probably derived from Egyptian religious traditions about the [Bennu bird.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennu) The resurrection of the Phoenix was a recognizable symbolic trope in Christian literature going all the way back to Clement of Rome, before the year 100, and Phoenix imagery was familiar through things like stained glass windows or manuscript illustrations:

Peterâ€™s book was a treatise on memory enhancement. Like most ancient and medieval approaches it focused on the use of vivid imagery to provide hooks for storing information in a retrievable way. The technique is often referred to as a [Memory Palace ](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/upshot/an-ancient-and-proven-way-to-improve-memory-go-ahead-and-try-it.html)and it tends to work best with striking imagery, so mythological creatures like the Phoenix would be useful.

Equally important, as a symbol of renewal the phoenix would be also be a good allegorical motif to use as an introduction to the method as a whole, which is designed to bring information back to life.
