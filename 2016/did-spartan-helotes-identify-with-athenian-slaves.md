No. From our perspective the two forms of oppression are quite similar, but to ancient observers the differences were more important than the similarities.

The two big differences between Athenian slaves and Spartan helots were __ethnicity__ and __community__ . The helots were the original Achaean inhabitants of Messenia and Laconia, conquered and reduced to bondage by the Spartans in the 7th or 8th century BC. They were all Greeks , though they spoke a different dialect from the Spartans. Unlike slaves in the rest of Greece, they still lived in their ancestral villages and they retained the religious and cultural identity they had before the Spartan conquest.

Athenian slaves on the other hand were a polyglot collection of people from all over the ancient world. They included Greeks and the children of Athenian slaves - but also hundreds of other ethnic groups with little in common.

In short, helots formed a community; slaves didn't. Even if they resented their Spartan masters, the helots would have been indignant to be compared to ordinary slaves.*

That didn’t mean they had a much safer or more secure life, however. Because the helots were a community and not isolated individuals, the Spartans were _terrified_  of them. The famous military Spartan system was not a defense against foreign enemies: it was internal security for the small Spartan minority in Laconia. Sparta was essentially an apartheid state. Thus, Spartan treatment of helots was usually [regarded as cruel](http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/greeklaw/a/Krypteia.htm) by other Greeks (and it was— one other things the Spartans made a point of doing was assassinating individual helots who looked like a threat). Xenophon - although a big fan of Sparta — said of the Helots, “they would gladly eat their masters raw.”

It didn’t take a lot of special insight to see that the helots were Sparta’s biggest strategic weakness. The Athenians definitely tried to exploit this: especially after the battle of [Pylos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pylos), when they had a toehold in the Peloponessus, they encouraged helots to abscond and tried to recruit them to fight against the Spartans. Because the helots were the backbone of the Spartan economy, every runaway was a victory: and, for the Spartans, this was the nightmare scenario. It’s no coincidence that the same thing happened a couple of generations later when the Thebans under [Epaminondas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epaminondas) finally humbled the Spartans. They liberated the helots of Messenia, permanently hobbling Spartan power.

_This battered bronze shield, excavated in the 1930’s bears the inscription “The Athenians from the Lacedaimonians at Pylos.” It’s a battle trophy from the Athenian attack which helped stir up a helot revolt in the Spartan homeland_ 

This illustrates the key difference — in Greek eyes, anyway — between slaves and helots: a conquering Greek army might liberate its own citizens from slavery in another city, but the rest of the slaves would be seen as an important part of the spoils of victory. Helotry was a unique institution which (unlike slavery) other Greeks viewed with dislike. Although the contradictions are glaringly obvious to us, in antiquity slavery was such an uncontroversial part of life that it didn't really enter into people's political consciousness ; it would be like modern countries trying to score points based on claims like “you collect taxes!” or “you put people in jail!” — _everybody_ did it. The permanent subjection of one set of Greeks to another, however was at best regarded as distasteful and at worst was genuinely detested.



_* There are always interesting complexities. Sometimes the Spartans enlisted helot soldiers, with the promise of freedom. Helots fought at_ _[Plataea](http://www.livius.org/articles/battle/plataea-479-bce/)_ _against the Persians, and under the very non-traditional Spartan general_ _[Brasidas](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/brasidas/)_ _. The Athenians recruited runaway helots at Pylos - but at_ _[Sphacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sphacteria)_ _it was helot volunteers, working for the promise of freedom, who smuggled food to the besieged Spartiates. On the other hand, Thucydides records that the Spartans reneged on their promise to free helot veterans and instead murdered 2,000 of them not long after Pylos and Sphacteria: it’s not clear if any of the victims included the helots who had braved the Athenian blockade._ 

_It’s also worth pointing out that this trick worked both ways: when the Spartans occupied_ _[Decelea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decelea)_ _in Attica during the last decade of the Peloponnesian war, many Athenian slaves (as many as 20,000 over a decade) took the opportunity to escape._
