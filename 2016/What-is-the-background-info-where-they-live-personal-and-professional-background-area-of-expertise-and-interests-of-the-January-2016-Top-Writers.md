I always thought I'd end up in academia... until I actually went to grad school and saw how the sausage was made. I dropped out of a PhD program in Roman History, long long ago, after finding some of my colleagues eagerly browsing obituaries in the American History Quarterly: when that's how you know where the jobs are opening up, it's probably time to reconsider your career choice! 

Luckily, I was already supplementing my graduate student pittance doing computer graphics (I'd wasted a lot of grad student nights on stolen mainframe time rendering out Greek temples at 12 hours per frame). So I quickly jumped forward from the first century to the twenty-first. I've been working in computer and video games for -- _erhmagerd !_ -- 20 years now: my first game was _Mech Commander_  back in 1996. Back when giant walking death machines were still cool.

Back then I was primarily an artist and animator (I did those mechs on the _MechCommander_  cover, for example, and the HoundEye from _[Half-Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game))_ .)

_(It was 15 years ago: if I remember right that's a 128 x 128 8-bit texture :)_ 

After _Half-Life, CounterStrike_ and _Team Fortress_  I gradually metamorphosed into what we call a 'Technical Artist' -- I specialize in figuring out _how_ to make game content as cheaply, efficiently and expressively as possible; a job I did for the SOCOM and Halo franchises after Valve. Nowadays my art/tech slider is jammed pretty hard on the tech side: my work is probably 80% programming. I'm currently the Technical Art Director currently at [Undead Labs ](https://undeadlabs.com/)in Seattle. I also work on the advisory committee for the Game Developers' Conference every year and I used to be the art editor for Game Developer Magazine (a gig I got only because former Editor-in-Chief Jen Olsen was a fellow renegade Latinist). I've been part-author on a couple of books with exciting titles like [Production Pipeline Fundamentals for Film and Games.](http://amzn.to/1OHG3Io) 

Unsurprisingly my writing is split between topics ancient and modern: history (the more obscurantist the better), game development, and programming. I've had a blast on Quora and I'm especially grateful for having a chance to reconnect with all that long-lost graduate school labor: I actually had an opportunity to dust off my knowledge of 9th century Lombard paleography just a few weeks ago -- a sentence I'm tickled pink to be able to write. I -- and my wife, who no longer has to listen to so much of my trivia -- are very grateful to be part of such a cool community.
