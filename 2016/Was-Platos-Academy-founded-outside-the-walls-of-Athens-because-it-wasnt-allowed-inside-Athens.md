The Academy or [Akademeia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademos)was a sort of cross between a shrine and a public park well before Plato. It was the shrine of the legendary hero Akademos, and also the location of a site sacred to Athena. It was formalized by [Cimon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimon), whose family owned the land — he put a boundary wall around the area and gave it to the public.

The informal group that was to be the “Academy” started meeting at Plato’s house, and then often at a gymnasion in the neighborhood of the Akademeia. The park and shrine were a convenient meeting place — the ‘groves of academe’ were the shady trees of the park where it was comfortable to debate and discuss out of the sun.

There’s definitely no reason to think the Platonists were hiding or exiled. The surrounding area was more or less what we’d think of a ‘wealthy suburb’. Plato’s associates were generally from upper-class backgrounds and so it’s not surprising the found the area convenient.
