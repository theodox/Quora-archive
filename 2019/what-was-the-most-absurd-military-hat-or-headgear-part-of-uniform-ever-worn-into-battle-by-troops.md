One of the most fabulous offshoots of the rivalry between Prussia and Austria in the 19th century was that the ingenuity which militarists typically lavish on devising ways to kill people was temporarily diverted into millinery. Producing these doozies:

_Prussian Life-Guards_

_Austrian Uhlans_ 

Not unlike the Austro-Prussian war, however, the Prussians clearly pulled this one out: their signature chapeau, the [Pickelhaube,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickelhaube) was surprisingly popular in the late 19th century even among people who ought to know better. For example, these hybrid pickelhaube-Pith helmets from the British.

And the one which eventually became the “Bobby helmet”!

But there’s also these American artillerists:

And these gents from company B of the 25th Infantry, the infantry arm of the Buffalo Soldiers. Not _exactly_  what Bob Marley had in mind?

Even Thailand and Chile got in on the act:

All kidding aside, though some of the more grotesque varieties of the pickelhaube were only for show on the parade ground it was also worn in earnest in several 19th century conflicts and also in the First World War

(so, for that matter, where those cruciform Austrian Uhlan helmets)

Almost all silly looking 19th century headgear actually evolved from systems intended to protect from overhead saber slashes; however in the case of the pickelhaube the plumes which originally decorated the spike disappeared, leaving a purely symbolic protection. The Uhlan [Czapka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czapka) was, at least potentially, useful — however the near complete disappearance of massed cavalry actions rendered it almost equally, er, pointless.

A simplified descendant of the Czapka is still dress gear in the Polish army:
