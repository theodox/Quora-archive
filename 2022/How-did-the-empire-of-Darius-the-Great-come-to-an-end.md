Darius died and it became the empire of his son Xerxes.

The empire was passed down — not quite from father to son, thanks to “a series of unfortunate events” within the royal family — until Darius III, a century and a half later. Darius III is often called the last Achaemenid emperor, but in fact he had one successor: his murderer, the a distant cousin named Bessus. Bessus killed the emperor while they were both on the run from Alexander the Great in 330 BC, and reigned for less than a year as Artaxerxes V. However, Alexander hunted the assassin down in short order and the Achaemenid empire was defunct in 329.

In other words: How did the empire of Darius the Great come to an end? Violently.
