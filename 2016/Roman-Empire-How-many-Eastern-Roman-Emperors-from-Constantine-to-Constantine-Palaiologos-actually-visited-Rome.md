Constantine visited Rome before settling in Constantinople (his signal victory at the [Battle of the Milvian Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Milvian_Bridge) was in Rome)

[Constans II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constans_II) briefly used Syracuse as his capital. He stopped in Rome on his way back to the east in 663.

[John VIII Palaiologos ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_VIII_Palaiologos)went to Rome in 1423, seeking support against the Ottomans, and I think again in 1439 for the Council of Florence.
