It is believed that the Romans got the idea for gladiatorial combat from the Etruscans: [The Roman Gladiator](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/gladiators.html)

Forcing people to fight to the death for entertainment and/or ritual isn't unique to the Romans; the [Aztec Flower Wars](http://www.aztec-history.com/aztec-flower-war.html) are another example.
