The location was never _completely_ forgotten, since the region was always densely inhabited. Well into Renaissance local people referred to the site as “the city”, even though the “city” had been buried for a millennium and a half. There’s[ even a medieval copy of a Roman map which faithfully recorded the location of Pompeii a thousand years after the city was buried](http://www.naplesldm.com/peutinger.php).

That said, only a really dedicated antiquarian would have really known there was any reason to look for Pompeii. The city was buried under six or seven meters of volcanic ash. In the immediate aftermath of the eruption, there’s evidence that Roman diggers did try to get at the city and its buried treasures — but over time the ash solidified into something more like rock, rendering digging difficult. The region was also radically changed: although today the city is now a couple of kilometers inland, in it’s heyday it was a riverside port city. So the urge to reuse the site was not strong: the city’s economic and strategic reason for being had disappeared beneath the volcanic pumice.

It’s likely that builders down the centuries blundered into bits and pieces of Pompeii more than once. However the first record of these findings was made by the architect Domenico Fontana (more famous for his contributions to St. Peter’s in Rome) who found some Roman frescoes during construction in the 1590’s.

However the significance of the discovery was not immediately obvious — Italians were hardly surprised to happen upon antiquities when digging. However as the region got more prosperous (Naples became Europe’s second largest city in the 17th century) more and more items turned up. Deliberate excavations started under king Carlo (III if you’re Spanish, but VIII if you’re from Naples) in 1738.
