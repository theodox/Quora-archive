That is one amazing piece of deadpan comedy. Haven’t laughed so hard in a long time! I’d offer [kudos](http://ihttps://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Kudos) if I believed that ancient Greece existed, har har.

Unless….

…oh wait...

_…really?_ 

Clearly these folks have not read [Steve Theodore's answer to Why do most scholars use Greek sources (like Homer and Herodotus) when studying ancient history, even though not a single manuscript has been found that was actually written by them?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-scholars-use-Greek-sources-like-Homer-and-Herodotus-when-studying-ancient-history-even-though-not-a-single-manuscript-has-been-found-that-was-actually-written-by-them/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=342e2b4a&srid=zLvM) They have no idea about how textual transmission actually works. They seem to think the fact that our physical copies generally date from the 9th-11th century is some kind of huge conspiracy that only a bunch of randos with access to google can penetrate.

If you actually need proof, start with __Homer__ like they did. It’s true that our oldest long-form Homer manuscript is medieval, I believe it’s[ codex laurentianus plutei 32.3](http://mss.bmlonline.it/s.aspx?Id=AWOIsXGwI1A4r7GxMJLk&c=II.%20Eiusdem%20[Homeri]%20Ranarum%20et%20murium%20pugna#/oro/9), a so-so copy from the 10th or 11th century. But, if you want to argue it was made up by a bunch of medieval monks, there’s quite a few problems: much older _pieces_ of Homer show up all the time. For example [Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 20 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_Oxyrhynchus_20)— dug out of Roman-era Egyptian rubbish dump — is from the 2d century. Evidently time traveling monks also got around to [burying a stone tablet inscribed with bunch of lines from Homer](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/oldest-greek-fragment-homer-discovered-clay-tablet-180969602/) around the same time in Greece. That tablet is mistakenly identified as the oldest Homer fragment but it’s only the oldest one in mainland Greece — the oldest actual evidence for Homer is a line from the Odyssey written on a broken pot from Olbia in the Ukraine around 400 BC. There are 50 or so other examples of bits of Homer written on other durable materials from before the 3d century BC.

I have to say, I’d be proud to shake the hand of the medieval monk who cooked up _that_ hoax and tramped all over the Mediterranean planting phony potsherds just so that archaeologists could find them 2,000 years later to keep the hoax going. That is an __epic prank__  on every level.



If all _that_ does not convince you, go read [Lysistrata, by Aristophanes](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7700/7700-h/7700-h.htm). For this video’s hypothesis to be true:

A bunch of medieval monks invented the fictional states of Athens and Sparta, along with detailed and very different cultures and histories to go with them

They then invented a fictional war between these fictional countries that lasted thirty fictional years, featuring campaigns everywhere from Sicily to Syria, using fictional weapons and tactics that are, accidentally, just like things we dig up archaeologically.

They created a cast of fictional politicians on different sides of the conflict, and set up phony inscriptions with their names and activities on them to maintain the illusion

They invented a fictional playwright who hated some of these fictional politicians (and they even fabricated a feud that lasted over several different fictional plays — accompanied by fictional anecdotes in a fictional encyclopedia that explained the references!)

Then, using the voice of this fictional playwright, the wrote a play using obscure rules of Greek verse

… about a sex strike, where the women of Greece refuse to have sex until peace is restored….

… and these _monks_ filled it up with a lot of ___dick jokes___ ….

… in a brand of Greek that nobody had spoken for a thousand years …

…and they even made up fictional Greek accents for the fictional Spartans…

which all ends up with prayers to a bunch of fictional Greek gods.

What would I not give to see the look on the face of the abbot of _that_ monastery when the brothers came in with that project proposal! “So you see, your reverence, you have to imagine these actors are wearing enormous inflatable penises, and Lysistrata has the girls leading the men around by them like leashes… It’ll be hilarious if you can decypher this phony archaic Greek we’ve invented! ”
