Good news and bad news are sort of the same thing here; the games business tends not to care very much about academic credentials. About the only time your schooling really counts is if you are talking to a large company (EA, UbiSoft, etc) and you've got no shipped titles. After two games, your degree and major won't count for very much; after 5 nobody will care -- and by that time you'll probably be looking for work primarily through former coworkers and professional connections, not sending resumes to answer ads in [Gamasutra](http://jobs.gamasutra.com/).

The flip side is that without technical background, most of the entry pathways are somewhat grueling no matter what you do. If you've got 3-d art skills (modeling, animation, texturing) you'll be judged primarily on your demo reel but if you're looking to get into design the paths are not very obvious. Many designers start work as [testers](http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/29/the-tough-life-of-a-games-tester), which is _way_  less fun than it sounds (though the linked article makes it sound worse than it is -- it's there to scare away the fainthearted). Testers don't get to do much fun or creative work but they do get a crash course in what games really are. The dream for most testers is to work in house, forge relationships with the dev team, and graduate upstairs to become a junior designer. If that's what you want to do, you should also start learning the rudiments of programming on your own; while designers usually don't write code they often do 'scripting' : "if the player has the red key open this door" which uses similar, though simpler, tools and skills.

Smart companies rely on the taste, opinions and good sense of their testers -- but not all companies are smart. Contract testing - where you work for an agency rather than directly for the game team - is only worth doing long enough to get real experience on your resume. The best thing about being a tester is that you are a part, albeit a somewhat marginalised part, of the development team : it's an unbeatable learning experience and a chance to make connections. On the other hand, contract testers rarely meet the teams they are testing for and are treated as interchangeable widgets (the story I linked doesn't say so but it's likely contract testers and not team members doing the complaining). So if you need a contract job to get your feet wet that's fine, but it's not a long term plan. 

The other way in is to find an indie project - a small studio that's just getting off the ground and is not in a position to be too picky about their hires. In most cases this is essentially a bet: if the game ships, you've got a resume bullet point and you're on your way to legitimacy; if the project fails -- a real possibility -- well, only you know if you can afford the time and financial risks. It's like breaking into TV by making an independent film -- it's possible, but most projects won't make it. 

Good resources:


[Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/) is the clearing house for game jobs in North America.

The [Game Developer's Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/), every march in San Francisco, is the big industry get together, particularly for the big budget side of the business. The [Casual Connect ](http://usa.casualconnect.org/)shows focus on smaller games and smaller teams, there will be more scrappy little outfits there who might take chances.

The [International Game Developers Association (IGDA)](http://www.igda.org/) is an advocacy and outreach group, they sponsor student groups and meetups for interested would-be developers in many cities.
