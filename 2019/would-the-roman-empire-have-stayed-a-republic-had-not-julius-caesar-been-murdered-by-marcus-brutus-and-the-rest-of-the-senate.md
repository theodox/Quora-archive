Almost certainly not. [A lot of observers (ancient and modern) think that Caesar was actively interested in monarchy](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-Julius-Caesar-rejecting-the-crowning-gesture-interpreted-as-him-wanting-to-be-king-rather-than-not-wanting/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=f7455ea8&srid=zLvM) and only pulled back when even his friends and supporters balked.

Even if he didn’t want the title of ‘king’ he had already had himself declared [Dictator perpetuo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator_perpetuo), essentially “supreme ruler for life” — a pretty clear indication that he never intended to relinquish power, and a flagrant violation of the traditional Roman meaning of ‘dictator’, which was always supposed to be a temporary office.

Moreover, [there’s a good case to be made that Caesar intended to bequeath his powers to somebody on his death](https://www.quora.com/Did-Julius-Caesar-intend-to-restore-the-Roman-Republic-and-end-his-dictatorship/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=5238b9f6&srid=zLvM): ironically, he probably thought of Brutus as his heir (rumor since antiquity has held that Caesar was actually Brutus’ biological father, though there’s never been conclusive proof).

So, it’s possible that Caesar might, like Augustus, have retained a facade of Republican institutions but it seems pretty clear that he had no intention of ever returning to the private life of an ordinary Senator. Suetonius quotes him as saying “Sulla did not know his ABC’s when he laid down his dictatorship”
