Definitely not. I think _voluntary_  Latin is great, but compulsion is only going to render it hateful to a lot of people.

I do think it’s a shame that so few schools offer it nowadays; besides the side benefits (like better grasp of English grammar and vocabulary) learning Latin puts you in more direct contact with the past 2500 years of European history — it’s not just the language of old dudes in togas, it’s also the language in which Newton wrote his books on math, the language in which Enlightenment _philosophes_  duelled each other in footnotes, the language in which the conventions of modern scholarship were hammered out…. it’s a treasure trove.

And it’s good for you! I agree with [Schopenhauer](http://www.udallasclassics.org/whyClassics.html#a):

> The result of [studying Latin] is that a writer will pay keen attention to the meaning and value of words, their order and connection, their grammatical forms. He will learn how to weigh them with precision, and so become an expert in the use of that precious instrument which is meant not only to express valuable thought, but to preserve it as well. Further, he will learn to feel respect for the language in which he writes and thus be saved from any attempt to remodel it by arbitrary and capricious treatment. Without this schooling, a man's writing may easily degenerate into mere chatter.

> To be entirely ignorant of the Latin language is like being in a fine country on a misty day. The horizon is extremely limited. Nothing can be seen clearly except that which is quite close; a few steps beyond, everything is buried in obscurity. But the Latinist has a wide view, embracing modern times, the Middle Age and Antiquity; and his mental horizon is still further enlarged if he studies Greek or even Sanskrit.

> If a man knows no Latin, he belongs to the vulgar, even though he be a great virtuoso on the electrical machine and have the base of hydrofluoric acid in his crucible.

But, despite all that, making it obligatory is worse than pointless. If Latin were still the international language that it was two hundred years ago, treating it as an obligation might make sense…. but not anymore.
