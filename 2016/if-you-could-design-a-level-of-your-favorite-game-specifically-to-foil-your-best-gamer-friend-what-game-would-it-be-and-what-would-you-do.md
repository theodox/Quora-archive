# If you could design a level of your favorite game specifically to foil your best gamer friend, what game would it be and what would you do?

Ok, let me start by saying that what I’m going to suggest is, on a certain level, _wrong._ It’s a deliberate violation of the implicit contract between gamers and game-makers, and as such it’s basically just _mean_ .

A proper mess-with-you level is particularly mean because if done right it would be supremely frustrating without actually giving away the fact that the players could never win. It’s trivially easy to make unwinnable levels: AI only miss their shots when you tell them too; damage numbers are easy fudge; it’s possible to predict player behavior in lots of tactical situations and make the ‘smart’ choice stupid. But most good players recognize those kinds of hamhanded maltreatment and quit — the obvious ways of messing with players are pretty juvenile, and most players are smart enough to put down their controllers in disgust and walk away once they realize they’re being jerked around.

Every game is basically a kind of language. In a proper, pro-social game you give the players a set of grammatical rules and gradually teach them how to combine them into a generative system in which the game can pose them a set of ‘questions’ and they can come back with answers. The classic example is the Mario-style progressive skill set, where you learn one move after another first in isolation, then in combinations as the levels demand more and more coordination of different skills along with tighter and tighter execution of those skills under pressure. For me, anyway, that’s the whole pleasure of games: it’s the fun of mastering a whole new way of expressing yourself, like learning a new language or a new musical instrument.

So if you really want to screw with somebody, you don’t just throw in bigger bosses, fewer ammo crates, or more precise jumps. You take away their mastery. You just__ ___change the rules out from under them___ __.__

_Super Mario 64 is famous for almost perfectly approximating player’s intuitions about things like jump height, hang time, and speed. Steve Swink’s book_ _[Game Feel](http://amzn.to/2dF08SG)_ _is a great guide to all the ways in which games create an implied contract with plays about ‘natural’ laws. If you read that - and then do your best to subvert it - you’ll make a supremely nasty level._ 

For a trivial example, think about platformers. You get the player to run through a series of challenges in which you teach them the height and distance they can expect from the jumps. You teach them the visual and auditory cues that help their muscle-memory kick in when needed.

And then you mess with them.

You play the sounds a little too early or a little too late. That jump which used to accelerate upwards at X units per second sometimes does X + .5, and sometimes at X -.5 units instead. The little bitmap block which says ‘safe landing zone’ once in a while becomes two pixels narrower. For a given mechanic there are lots of ways you can do it, and if you’re a real sadist you do it in the subtlest, least obvious and above all least predictable way possible. You make sure that mastery is impossible by noising up the signals that the game is sending them; maybe you even introduce false signals (like a green light which starts off as a predictor of when they’re going to make the jump — and then starts being wrong). You toss in false correlations that last for ten or fifteen minute to convince them that they’ve finally cracked the code … and then you make them stop working.

Basically what you’re doing is ‘moving the goalposts’. You let them learn something and then sneakily invalidate what they’ve learned just after it’s become habit. If you’re truly evil, you do it by actually responding to their performance: watch for inputs that indicate they are grasping a mechanic properly, and start to insert more and more randomness into what you just taught them was a natural law.

A lot of games do this already, but not intentionally. They are plain, innocent, crappy games. But to do it on purpose — to deliberately mislead the finely tuned pattern recognition apparatus which marks the skilled gamer — is hard. If there is a rhythm to your abuse they’ll spot it quickly (players are _so_  smart. It’s scary). If there’s an law of the game universe that gets them out of your traps, they’ll find it. But if you are really rigorous about how you get under their skins you can subtly drive them mad without ever quite giving away how mean you are and you can keep them banging away with false hopes of finally getting it.

Essentially, what you’re trying to is to create [learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness). And, if you’re familiar with the way psych researchers came up with that term, it’s basically sadism. Don’t do it.
