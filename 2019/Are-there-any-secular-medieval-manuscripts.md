TLDR: __yes__ .

Here, for example, is a lovely piece of medieval information design:

If you look closely you’ll see it’s an multiplication table, albeit one in clunky Roman numerals. This was copied towards the ends of the 1100’s (the original book is from the sixth century — the author, the philosopher [Boethius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boethius), was a Roman lived well after the end of the Roman empire in the west: he served the Ostrogothic kings of Italy).

There’s no reason to be surprised at the existence of something so utilitarian, despite the picturesque decorative elements. Boethius’s book was a standard math textbook until the Renaissance; pretty much any place with enough money to have a collection of books would have had an example, though this one is clearly an expensive prestige item rather than a student text. His more advanced worked covered geometry, number theory, astronomy, and music theory (which, following ancient Greek tradition, was regarded as a branch of mathematics).

__Practical texts__ 

The fact is, even in the depths of the so-called “dark ages”, literacy was an obviously useful tool that never fell out of use. Post-Roman Europe was — until around the 11th century or so — mostly rather _poorer_  than Roman Europe but it was far from a barbaric wasteland or a superstitious backwater. It was a fragmented and often embattled society, but one which still had to feed and clothe and house and defend itself — all of which are _a lot easier_  with the aid of the written word. Even your average fur-clad Nibelung warrior, when not quaffing ale from giant horn, wants to now how many peasants are toiling away on his estates, or the proper way to divide up the estate of an unlucky thegn who ended up on the wrong end of a lance.

This is the title page of a copy of the [Salic Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salic_law), (if you squint at the right hand page you can jut make out _Incipit prologus legis Salicciensis Francorum,_ “Here begins the prologue of the laws of the Salian Franks”). This one comes from a collection of Roman, Frankish, and Allemannic laws made by [Duke Lantfrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantfrid) as part of his effort to establish himself as an independent ruler: an excellent illustration of the fact that____ the written word never lost its prestige in medieval Europe, even among the back-stabbiest of warlords.

This rather nicer production is another illustration of the same principle:

This one does include a bit of theological language (if you look closely, you can see it starts _in nomine sanctae et indivisbilitatae trinitatis, “in the name of the holy and indivisible trinity”)_ but it is an eminently practical document: it’s the wedding contract between Holy Roman Emperor [Otto II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) and Byzantine princess [Theophanu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophanu) in the year 972. This beautiful document — written in gold ink on a silk-backed parchment, dyed with imperial purple — is the written expression of a complex piece of diplomacy that took almost decade of negotiations and horsetrading to complete. Producing this single document probably cost as much as a middling feudal manor; a clear sign of the prestige of the written word and the outsized ambitions of the Ottonian dynasty.

__The “publishing industry”__ 

It’s certainly It’s true that the post-Roman ruling class of Europe was largely (though not exclusively) a warrior aristocracy. Many of them may not have shared their Roman predecessors’ feeling that one could not quite be a proper member of the ruling class without a working knowledge of Cicero; literacy rates among the upper classes in the Roman period were definitely higher than they would be until the High Middle Ages. However you can be a very successful illiterate barbarian king who simply hires people do handle your record keeping for you — Lantfrid’s law book above was done by a monk named Waldgarius in Lyon, though it eventually ended up in the monastery library of St Gallen in Switzerland.

That clerical connection here is important both for the truth about medieval libraries and for the modern misconceptions about them.

There’s a reason why “clerical” and “cleric” share a root. The Church by itself didn’t have a monopoly on literacy by any means. Copying manuscripts, however, was highly expensive skilled work; it required training, infrastructure and many supporting crafts. During the long, impoverished years between the fall of Rome and, say, the 11th century monasteries were among the very few institutions in Europe which could afford to support such a specialized form of labor. So many of the manuscripts which served entirely boring secular purposes still originated in monasteries, for the same reasons that the monasteries also produced excellent beer and wine — it was a high-value market and the monasteries were the best run organizations on the continent. So, you get a lot of items like Lantfrid’s code: a mix of routine statecraft and political propaganda which looks (especially if you squint) like it might be a Gospel.

Books were expensive, but they were far from unattainable. There was a vast amount of completely practical material for doctors, teachers, and other professionals; there were reams of contracts, wills, and other legal paperwork. There was never a time when Europe was without vast amount of humdrum secular paperwork (law codes, contracts, tax rolls and so on) and there was never a time when obviously useful things like geometry or medicine weren’t being studied and transmitted. And if you wanted a book, some version of it had passed through the network of monasteries and schools which sustained book production until professional paid scribes took the book business in the 14th century.

__Secular literature__ 

You might wonder if those monks refused to copy things they disapproved of. Presumably some of them did — but clearly plenty of them did not. It can’t be emphasized enough that everything you’ve ever seen or read of the ancient world was copied over, probably several times, between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance — probably, though not exclusively, by a monk being paid to do the copying and keep his opinions to himself. If you’re an optimist, you can say they were dedicated to the preservation of culture of all kinds. If you’re a cynic, you could say they were dedicated to earning the fairly significant wages of a copyist (by the 14th century, a [brand new book might cost more than a small cottage](https://www.academia.edu/9890330/The_Cost_of_Doing_Scribal_Business_Prices_of_Manuscript_Books_in_England_1300_1483)). But, either way, the books got copied.

_To get an idea of how much the Medieval world valued books, consider how most medieval libraries had to combat book theft.

This means that atomistic skepticism of Lucretius made it to the hands of modern skeptics because somebody — [probably Charlemagne himself](http://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3217) — paid to have _[De Rerum Natura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_rerum_natura)_  copied around the same time Walgarius was penning Duke Lantfrid’s law book. Around the year 880, some Welsh monk copied over Ovid’s pickup-artist handbook _[Ars Amatoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Amatoria)_ _,_ and bound it, incongruously, in the same volume as sermon on the finding of the True Cross. Many oddities of medieval pseudo-science aren’t the fanciful inventions of medieval ignorance: from the headless [Blemmyae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_men) to the [remora fish that could stop a ship,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echeneis) most of those misapprehensions come straight from Gaius Plinius’s _[Historia Naturalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_History_(Pliny))_ _,_ medieval Europe’s standard pop-sci text_._ Edward the First took a French translation of the Roman military handbook _[De Re Militari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_re_militari)_ __ for break-time reading on his crusade. Medieval war-stories were full of overblown allusions to Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, and Achilles:

Heck, somebody actually bothered to recopy the _[Tabula Peutingeriana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_Peutingeriana)_ _,_ a map of the Roman road network so old that it still shows Pompeii as a destination.

_A section of the Tabula Peutingeriana, with Pompeii, Stabiae and Oplontis still shown at right, though they had all been buried for a millennium when this was copied. The map is east-up, not north up, and compressed to save space, but it’s still got the old Roman mile-markers.

Medieval people _loved books._ Given how much money and labor was involved in conserving them, they had to.

Which, of course, is a reminder that there were always original writers throughout the Middle Ages. Leaving aside the theologians and sermonizers, these years produced everything from delicate [love poems](https://interestingliterature.com/2015/01/26/10-short-medieval-poems-everyone-should-read/) to bawdy (and blasphemous) [drinking songs](https://www.medievalists.net/2014/11/medieval-drinking-song/) to [illustrated books on how to prepare medicinal herbs](https://trinitycollegelibrarycambridge.wordpress.com/2014/10/27/gales-herbarium-2/). [Epic adventures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Song_of_Roland), [travelogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoric_of_Pordenone), [political pamphlets](http://www.lhschools.org/Downloads/Gregory%20vs%20Henry.pdf), [histories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_de_Joinville), even [off-color humor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmina_Burana) — the Middle Ages had them all. Heck, neither JRR Tolkien nor Marvel Comics would be where they are today without [Snorri Sturluson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snorri_Sturluson), the medieval Icelandic chronicler who wrote down our [most vivid accounts of Norse mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_Edda).

__Conclusion__ 

The years between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance were tough times in large parts of Europe. Britain, for example, nearly lost all of its literate and urban culture for about a century. However the prestige and utility and versatility of the written word remained very high, even in that impoverished context. The legend of king Arthur, for example, exists today because of a somewhat garbled chain of books which connected [embattled post-Roman outposts, still dreaming of Britain’s Roman-era heyday](https://www.quora.com/Was-Britain-s-Roman-history-reflected-anywhere-in-Arthurian-legends/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=72b6d6d7&srid=zLvM), to the [romantic poets of eleventh-century France ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chr%C3%A9tien_de_Troyes)and thence to the fifteenth century printing press of [William Caxton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Caxton).
