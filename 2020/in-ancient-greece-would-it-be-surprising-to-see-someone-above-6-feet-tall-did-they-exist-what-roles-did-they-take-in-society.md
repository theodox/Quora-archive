# In Ancient Greece, would it be surprising to see someone above 6 feet tall? Did they exist? What roles did they take in society?

They existed, though they were definitely taller than average. We don’t have great archaeological data because Greeks generally practiced cremation, but our data is fairly consistent: Greek males tended to average in the mid 160-cm range (ie, 5′4″ -ish) and Greek women in the mid-low 150’s (ie, right around 5′). This is inline with numbers for Romans — the data from Pompeii, for example, is almost the same. The averages probably reflect a mix of genetics and diet. The range is similar to several places in the Pacific today, such as Malaysia.

However there are literary references to people who were larger. For example, [in Aritstophanes’ Frogs,](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0032%3Acard%3D1006) the ghost of Aeschylus tells the audience his characters were “noble men of 4 cubits” — which would be just about our 6′1″ or 185cm. The “noble” might be relevant here, since the upper classes had a more varied diet with better access to meat — certainly in later Europe the difference between ordinary people and their supposed betters was often visible from a hundred yards away and it’s likely this was true in Greece as well. We don’t have good data but it’s likely that people from areas where stock-rearing was common (Thessaly and Macedonia, maybe Sicily) were taller and those from places like Attica where grazing land was at a premium were on the shorter end of the Greek scale.

Height was regarded as attractive in a man, and to a degree for women — but there are references to women wearing stooping and wearing the flattest possible sandals to avoid looking “too tall.” Greeks were completely and unashamedly “lookist”: in their aristocratic point of view physical height and personal beauty were attributes of nobility — which of course suggests that they were also not universal. To be a Greek noble was to be _kaloskagathos_ , “beautiful and good”… and probably a bit over 5′6″, unless you a true __τετράπηχυς,__ a heroic 4-cubit role model.
