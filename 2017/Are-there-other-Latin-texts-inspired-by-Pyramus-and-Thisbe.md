The story was pretty widespread — enough so that it showed up in other media, like this bowl.

_Note the wall in the center with the legend INVIDE.CVR.PARIES.IUVENES.DISIUNGIS.AMANTES_ _[Bowl with Pyramus and Thisbe (y1941-21)](http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/21672)_ 

As a popular and well known tale it generated a lot of poetic retellings, [six of which are collected in this (unfortunately paywalled) article.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2854536?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) As a common theme it was also a good hook for preachers looking for a ‘hook’ for their sermons. [This article (also paywalled) ](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13660691.2016.1225386)includes a few examples.

Not quite Latin - unless you count the chapter headings - is Chaucer’s [Legend of Good Women](http://ummutility.umm.maine.edu/necastro/chaucer/translation/lgw/lgw.html), II.
