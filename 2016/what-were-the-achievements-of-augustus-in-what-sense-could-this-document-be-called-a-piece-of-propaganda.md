It sound’s like you’re asking about the [Res Gesta Divi Augusti](http://classics.mit.edu/Augustus/deeds.html):

Well, it’s the officially published autobiography of a ruler who got to decide everything that went into it, and who ensured that copies of of it were erected all over the empire. It’s hardly a neutral statement of fact.

However, it’s not exactly ‘propaganda’ in the modern sense, because it wasn’t primarily intended to influence public opinion. Augustus, after all, didn’t need to worry about winning elections or saving souls. What it really is the last, greatest example of the Roman aristocratic tradition of bragging: it’s a long list of the many ways in which Augustus benefitted Rome.

Roman aristocrats had always expended a lot of effort in promoting themselves and their families: being a member of the Roman elite was like being a big time rapper:. It was intensely an competitive, public culture and humility wasn’t a virtue. Augustus was, by far, the greatest of them all: he flattened all the competition (often at sword-point) and he also outspent and outshone all of his rivals as an empire builder and public benefactor. His famous quote “I found Rome a city of brick, and left it a city of marble” is a perfect example of the attitude. The _Res Gestae_ was the last mic-drop of an unbeatable career.
