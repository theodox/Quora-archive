The Greeks had a habit — more like a compulsion, really — of assuming that other people’s deities were their own ones under different names. It’s not quite as ethnocentric or naive as it sounds: after all the version of a familiar deity like Athena or Poseidon in your home city could very well be quite foreign to another Greek too, since the ultimate origins of Greek tradition were extremely fractured, unsystematic, and localized. If Athena in Sparta looks and is worshipped rather differently than she does in Athens, it’s not too much of a stretch to imagine that she’d show up rather differently in Memphis or Babylon.

This habit of “translating” foreign religious figures into familiar ones is so common that scholars refer to it as the _[Interpretatio Graeca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretatio_graeca)_ _._ 



According the the traditional _interpretatio_ which mapped Egyptian deities onto the Greek pantheon, Hermes was associated with [Thoth](https://www.ancient.eu/Thoth/#:~:text=Thoth%20is%20the%20Egyptian%20god,from%20the%20forehead%20of%20Set.), the Egyptian god of wisdom and scholarship. As often happens with these kinds of cultural translation, it’s not really clear _why_  the Greeks settled on this identification. It’s probably based on Hermes’ role as a patron of writing and language: in Egyptian tradition, Thoth is the inventor of writing and the protector of scholars. However there are also a lot of Thoth stories which emphasize his cleverness and versality: Hermes, as the presiding deity of both merchants and thieves, was also associated with wiliness. It’s important to point out, however, that this mapping was far from complete or logically airtight: in this example, Hermes role as “divine messenger” and his job of guiding the spirits of the dead to the underworld are both mostly ignored.

This association of Thoth with Hermes dates back at least to the sixth century BC: Herodotus doesn’t call it out by name but he happens to mention that the Egyptians mummify ibis in “the city of Hermes” — by which he means the Egyptian city of [Khmunu](https://www.britannica.com/place/Hermopolis-Magna), known in Greek as _Hermopolis._  The ibis was sacred to Thoth, and Thoth is typically depicted with an ibis head:

Alexander the Great’s conquest of Egypt (331 BC) began a long period of cultural fusion between Greeks and Egyptians which built on the pre-existing habit of associating the two traditions. The hybridized figure of Thoth-Hermes became a kind of generic symbol for all kinds of esoteric knowledge. The alchemical and magical traditions of the Roman empire tended to accumulate around him (them) under the name _[Hermes Trismegistos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus)_ , “Hermes the Thrice-Greatest”). He’s the central figure in a large, if somewhat confusing body of literature known as the [Hermetic tradition](http://gnosis.org/library/hermet.htm): it combines a very exalted, mystical view of the mind which would be very familiar to a modern New Age practitioner alongside a much more pragmatically-oriented (if not very practical) set of instructions for magic and alchemy. These texts eventually became central to a variety of modern mystical movements, notably [Rosicrucianism](https://www.rosicrucian.org/rosicrucian-digest-hermetism) and [Masonry](https://freemasoninformation.com/2013/12/freemasonry-and-hermetica/).

In it’s fully evolved form Hermeticism has very little practical connection with either Greek or Egyptian traditional religions. It’s closer to what a modern historian of philosophy would call [Neo-Platonism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/neoplatonism/) or a historian of religion would call [Gnosticism](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2015/02/gnostics-and-platonists/). There are quite a few Hermetic texts that you [could read out loud in most churches without causing much of a stir](http://gnosis.org/library/grs-mead/grms_hymn_hermes.htm).

If you’re not much of a mystic, the Hermes-Thoth identification still has one other much more obvious trace that you encounter at least once a week. The Greeks weren’t the only ones who got into the business of identifying other people’s deities as their own. The Romans had their own version, the _interpretatio Romana —_ that’s why we tend to think of Zeus and Jupiter as two names for the same god when in fact they had quite distinct traits and associated stories. The Romans assimilate Greek Hermes to their own Mercurius — not primarily looking at his reputation as a linguist or a scholar, but in his capacity as a merchant god: Mercurius shared a linguistic root with _merchandise_ and _market._ Nonetheless, they did the divine algebra: if Hermes = Thoth and Mercury = Hermes then clearly Mercury = Thoth.

When the Romans conquered Gaul, they encountered a mixture of Celtic and Germanic people who themselves shared a complex set of mix-and-match deities. The most prominent of these was [Lugus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugus): a Celtic god whose defining characteristic was his knowledge of the deep mysteries of the universe. When Julius Caesar tried to describe this god to his Roman readers,[ he said that the Gauls and Germans were particularly devoted to Mercury](https://www.quora.com/What-deity-did-Julius-Caesar-identify-with-the-Roman-God-Mercury/answer/Steve-Theodore) — the esoteric wisdom of Hermes-Thoth felt like the best fit. But the Gauls themselves had long had religious crossovers with their Germanic neighbors, and the Germanic god we’d recognized as [Odin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin#Other_names). The Gauls (or the Greek and Roman writers we rely on for information) assumed that this god was the same as Lugus, who was the same as Mercury, who was the same as Hermes, and thus the same as Thoth.

[The Romans picked up the 7-day week, with each day corresponding to a heavenly body, sometime around the second century](https://www.quora.com/Who-invented-the-seven-day-week-we-all-use-today/answer/Steve-Theodore). Each day got associated with a planet (Mars, Venus, etc) or with the sun or the moon. But the planets themselves were named for different gods. Those associations are yet another example of theological calculus: it was the Babylonians who decided that the closest planet to the sun was associated with [Nabu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabu), the god who was the patron of their scribal class and the inventor of writing.

You can just guess who the Greeks chose to associate Nabu with: Hermes-Thoth-Mercury-Lugus-Odin, of course. That’s why every Romance language has a day of the week named for Mercury: _Mercredi_  in French, _Miercoles_  in Spanish, and so on. But in English we have Wednesday — which of course is just [Woden’s ](https://sites.nd.edu/manuscript-studies/2015/04/02/woden-allfather-of-the-english/)day, in other word’s Odin’s day. Thus, every week you have Thothsday followed by Thursday, which is interesting but extremely hard to pronounce.
