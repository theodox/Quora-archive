It’s probably better not to use “property” in this context.

Many Greek cities had publicly owned slaves. In Athens, the [Scythian archers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythian_archers) are the most famous example, but all sorts of civic bureaucratic functions were filled by _[demosioi hyperetai](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/demosioi-e315470)_ _—_ everything from maintaining roads to managing the day-to-day operations of the mint were done by slaves owned by the polis. But (even though this is a relatively privileged class of slave) they were still _slaves,_ which meant that they were unlikely to have families or personal property of their own.

In most ways helotry resembles _serfdom_ more closely than slavery proper — helots had their own, longstanding communities and they had their own families. The idea of ‘state ownership’ is to some degree an effort to jam the square peg of helotry into the round hole of other forms of Greek slavery; describing them as ‘state slaves’ makes it easier to account for the fact that an ordinary Spartiate could not simply take his helots off to some other city and auction them off, but it tends to obscure the fact that the real bond for helots was to the land they worked rather than to the individual who was assigned that land.

All analogies are a bit misleading here (and of course, since good evidence is really scarce for Sparta, they all have to be put in air quotes) but it’s probably easier to think of the helots as something like late-Roman _coloni_ or early medieval serfs, who were bound to the land and from an economic standpoint were regarded as almost an aspect of it in the same way that a barn or a farmhouse would be. There is plenty of evidence for varieties of treatment (some masters being better or worse than others) and also for masters “loaning” helots to each other, but they were not salable. The use of helots as domestic servants and on campaign is kind of a gray area, however — its a shame our evidence doesn’t let us understand more about the details.

Still, as analogies go “serf” is better than “slave” for helots.
