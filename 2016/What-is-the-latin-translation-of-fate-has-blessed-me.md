“Blessed” would probably be _beatus/-a._ 

_fato beatus_ (or, for a female _fato beata)_  translates most easily as “blessed by fate” but grammatically beatus is an adjective, not a verb part. If you want a complete sentence it would be _fato beatus/-a sum._  Latin is usually comfortable dropping things like “I am” where they can be inferred. There’s no “by” because the ending of _fato_  tells the reader that the something happened ‘because of fate’.

If you want to keep the verb part you could try _fato benedictus/-a sum. Benedico_ is the verb for ‘blessing’ and in this case _benedictus_  is a past participle so its closer to the English structure. OTOH the word itself is very Late Latin — If i remember correctly it was invented for the Latin translation of the Bible — so if you want a more ‘classical’ feel it doesn’t work but if you’re looking for something more medieval it’s spot on.
