I suspect that objectively you'd probably be best off in China, since much of the historic success of China was due to providing more people with more food than most comparable cultures. You chances of social betterment were pretty slim, but not completely nonexistent, and you not much worse off for physical security than most others. 

The main drag on this as a choice was that China repeatedly did so well that it hit a Malthusian cap with drastic de-population. Europe had two big shrinkages, one at the end of the Roman period and the black death, but generally had an upward trend. I'm not enough of a statistician to know what your chances as a Chinese peasant of ending up in the good parts of the cycle or the bad one would be.
