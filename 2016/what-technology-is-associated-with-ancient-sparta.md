The Spartans were a highly traditionalist military society; they didn't have the equivalent of a modern military-industrial complex. Their Greek compatriots regarded them as somewhat unsophisticated.

They were distinctly uncomfortable with the highest-technology piece of military equipment available in their day: the [trireme](http://www.ancient.eu/trireme/) galleys which dominated Greek naval warfare. The Spartans had to rely primarily on their allies (and on mercenaries, hired with Persian money) to counter the naval skills of their primary rivals, the Athenians.

_Too high tech for Sparta_ 

Spartans were not particularly good at military engineering either. In 30 years of on-and-off warfare they never breached the walls of Athens, despite nearly annual invasions of Athenian territory. Their siege of [Plataea](http://www.livius.org/pb-pem/peloponnesian_war/war_t10.html), a dinky town with only 400 defenders, dragged on for more than two years; the Persians -- not particularly famous for seigecraft --- [took Babylon (the largest city in the world)](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/darius-the-great/sources/capture-of-babylon-herodotus/) in slightly less time. 

And as for civilian technology they actively disdained it: arts and crafts were only tolerated insofar as they contributed to feeding, clothing and housing the Spartiates ; anything else was disdained as a luxurious indulgence that would make men weak. A 'real' Spartan (one of the 15% or so of the male population who were actual 'Spartans' of the '300' variety) were forbidden to engage in any commerce of craft production. Vital crafts like smithery and engineering were left in the hands of resident foreigners or second-class citizens like the [Perioeci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioeci). 

The only known Spartan innovation is the [Scytale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale), a simple form of analog encryption used for sending military messages securely. Each army commander had a staff of a particular, precise diameter. Messages were written on long strips wound around the staff -- without a staff of the correct diameter the message could not be read properly.

 This was reasonably effective, given the Greek penchant for writing without punctuation -- but it's hard to believe that wily Athenian commanders didn't maintain a library of sticks with different diameters just in case.
