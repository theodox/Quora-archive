You can always play [Counter-Strike Zombies](http://store.steampowered.com/app/273110/), which is free, or [Team Fortress 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/440/?snr=1_5_9__300). There's plenty of free games out there these days. Sure, F2P and in-app purchases and nagware are all annoying, but you can thank the pirates for all that: if people want your stuff and don't want to pay for it, you find ways to make a living. Pirating is also [big vector for malware](http://thehackernews.com/2013/04/90-of-pirated-games-are-infected-with.html), as well as being sleazy. 

And, since [I worked on the original game](http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/429818-counter-strike/credit), I _will_  put a price on your head if you pirate it.
