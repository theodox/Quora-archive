In one word, yes. A lot of what we see about Augustus is what he wanted seen. 

Augustus used a combination of patronage, soft censorship, and veiled threats to help create the "Augustan Age" in literature and the arts as part of a very sophisticated and self-conscious program of propaganda. His whole public persona was carefully crafted, right down to his name: born Gaius Octavius Thurinus, he always insisted on being addressed as Gaius Julius Caesar after his adoption by Caesar: Roman custom would have added "Octavianus" but he dropped his own name completely.

_The_ _[Augustus of Prima Porta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_of_Prima_Porta)_ _was copied all over the empire as one of the most common representations of the emperor. The pose and expression are modelled very deliberately on a fanous Greek original. It's also worth pointing out that this serene youth was actually a balding emperor of 43 when the statue was erected in 20BC._  

When he was in power, he was a canny patron of the arts and letters. One of his most closest supporters was [Maecenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Maecenas) -- the most important tastemaker in Rome. Maecenas (in consultation with Augustus) supported writers and artists -- among the well known names who were fostered by Maecenas and Augustus are [Virgil,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil) [Horace,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace) and [Propertius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propertius). The regime also discouraged literature on 'incorrect' themes -- most famously, Augustus personally ordered [Ovid ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid) banished to a remote outpost on the Black Sea, at least in part* because of the _Ars Amatoria,_ a how-to book for pickup artists which contradicted the spirit of Augustus' conservative legislation about marriage.

_The_ [Res Gestae Divi Augusti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_Gestae_Divi_Augusti),_Augustus' political testament, was copied in hundreds of imperial temples all over the Roman world, allowing Augustus to define his legacy in his own words._  

All that acknowledged, it is still telling that Augustus' reputation was as good as it was. Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero and the rest on all had the same powers as Augustus: absolute control of the military, a healthy purse for supporting friendly artists and writers. We know (for example) that Nero was a free-spending patron of the arts -- after his death, the short-lived emperor and former courtier [Otho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otho) briefly revived a song-book which Nero had published, as well as sponsoring a lavish public celebration of Nero's deification. This quite signally failed, however, to grant Nero much of a positive reputation in posterity. Domitian (from the dynasty that replaced the Julio-Claudians, and which probably sponsored many of the salacious tales about them in Suetonius) ran an efficient police state -- but on his death the Senate had his monuments destroyed and mobs gleefully demolished his statues and inscriptions. Merely cranking out the panegyrics and putting up statues was not sufficient to render an unpopular emperor immune from criticism. 

To some degree Augustus -- as the ultimate origin of the imperial power -- was less liable to criticism from succeeding dynasties: unlike the later Julio-Claudians nobody particularly benefitted from making him look bad. 

Nonetheless he was, by most objective measures, an extremely successful emperor: he presided over an exceptionally long reign of peace and prosperity, his military ventures were more successful than not; and above all when contrasted to the chaos of the Republic before and the chaotic palace politics which came after him he racked up a much smaller body count. [Philo of Alexandria](http://cornerstonepublications.org/Philo/Philo_On_The_Embassy_to_Gaius.html) -- who as a provincial and more importantly as a Jew was rather insulated from the vendettas of Roman aristocratic politics -- was comfortable describing Augustus as the 'averter of evil', the 'guardian of the peace', and 

> he who gave freedom to every city, who brought disorder into order, who civilized and made obedient and harmonious, nations which before his time were unsociable, hostile, and brutal.

There's a good, extended discussion of the politics of Augustus' reputation in Adrian Goldsworthy's [Augustus: First Emperor of Rome ](http://amzn.to/1rBDRtU).



_* However it's also thought that he may have been somehow connected to the disgrace of Augustus' wayward daughter_ _[Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_the_Elder)_ _. In an absolute monarchy the personal and the political can't be disentangled._
