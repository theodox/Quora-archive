They’d think it was cute. I mean, who doesn’t?

But in a world where the following was regarded as serious zoology, they would not find it seriously unusual:

The [Griffin](http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast151.htm), with the body of a lion but the head and wings of an eagle:

The [Bonnacon](http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast80.htm), a bull-like creature the uses dung as a weapon:

The [Echeneis](http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast422.htm), a fish which attaches itself to the bottom of ships and slows them down with its powerful fins:

The [Barnacle Goose](http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast1195.htm), which grows on trees.

There’s plenty more [here](http://bestiary.ca/index.html). In fairness to medieval peasants, almost all of this stuff actually comes from the scientific heyday of the Greeks and Romans and not from “medieval barbarism”.

But, like I said, in this kind of rogues gallery a Platypus is merely amusing.
