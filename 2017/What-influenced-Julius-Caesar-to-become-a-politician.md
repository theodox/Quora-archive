It’s not too much of an exaggeration to say he had no choice. Politics was what you did if you were a self-respecting Roman aristocrat: it was the the primary way you established yourself in Roman society. It’s probably worth pointing out that for upper class Romans most possible occupations were literally illegal: legally you couldn’t become a merchant or a banker, and your estates and property were managed by your slaves. Taking too much of an interest in grubby economic was supposed to be beneath you — an same attitude you might expect from a toffy character in _Downton Abbey_ .

So, your primary pursuits were either politics or literature, or more often some combination of both ([Caesar was an exceptionally good writer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-of-Julius-Caesar-as-a-writer), as even his political opponents admitted, though we don’t have his poetry anymore). If you had the money and family connections, it was simply expected that you’d enter politics — not to do so made you look like a loser. Your lower status was expressed formally in things like where you got to sit in the theater, what kind of clothes you were allowed to wear, and how you’d be buried — not to mention less access to the monetary rewards of power.

Some people still chose to remain outside the political track — probably the most famous example is [Maecenas,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Maecenas) the dean of Roman literature — but it was definitely an “alternative lifestyle” for any blue-blooded, status-conscious Roman.
