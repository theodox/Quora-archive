Although we call them 'Arabic' numerals, since they reached Europe via Arab culture in the the ninth or tenth centuries, the symbols were originally from India. Along with the idea of positional notation -- writing a '3' and a '5 for '3 tens and 5 ones' instead of a separate characters meaning '30' and '5' -- they made paper calculations much easier.

You can see how the character shapes share a lot of aesthetic similarity to [Devanagari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari) writing. 

Arab and Persian contacts with India brought the Indian system to the Mediterranean, and they came to Europe soon thereafter (in the 10th century in particular Europeans were actively absorbing many kinds of knowledge from the Arab world).

Nowadays it's debated how much of a difference the decimal number system really made: with a good abacus many complex calculations can be done quite quickly (see [Roman numerals had no zero; did this impede any kind of scientific or cultural advancement?](https://www.quora.com/Roman-numerals-had-no-zero-did-this-impede-any-kind-of-scientific-or-cultural-advancement/answer/Steve-Theodore)). Still, there's no question that the modern world runs on Hindi-Arabic numerals.
