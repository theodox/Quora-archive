# Are my PC parts compatible? I'm building a PC. I don't want Tfue's setup, I just wanna run at least 100 fps with good resolution. Including a monitor, around $1500 (maybe $1700). I have the parts, I just wanna know if they are good and compatible.

[PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) is a decent resource for making sure your choices hang together. It’s not perfect — it didn’t warn that my last cooler didn’t _exactly_  fit my last case, and I had to fabricate a bracket. But as far as things like matching coolers to cpus to motherboards it’s not bad.
