Accidents of transmission account for a lot - even for periods which are "well documented," the overwhelming majority of contemporary sources are lost. For example, we know that [Plutarch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch) quotes extensively from letters written by [Alexander the Great](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great) to various people in the Greek world - but we know of those letters only by quotations preserved in Plutarch and a handful of other authors. Moreover some of the letters appear to be fake - they may be deliberate historical distortions, literary works which were misread by later authors, accidental misreadings of letters from other people and so on. 

 In Europe much of the blame for this goes to the fall of Rome, the decay of urban life and the decline in literacy that went with it. However in the Byzantine world, which maintained a more-or-less unbroken literary tradition down to 1453 you see a very similar phenomenon. The sad fact is that before the invention of printing, the production of books was a _very slow_  and expensive process: it's hard to put a hard number on it (due to differences in quality, style, subject matter and scripts). By way of reference, a really talented copyist in the 15th century might -- _might --_  produce 9 pages of manuscript in a single day; a more realistic number is slightly over 1 page per day; various faster shorthands existed for practical uses, like court recordings, but these were illegible to most people even in literate societies). Individual books could easily take a year or more to recopy. 

This meant that only very rich patrons, or very dedicated individuals, could ensure large scale re-copying. Outside of material that was needed for daily use -- law books, tax records, Bibles and so on - most manuscripts existed in very few copies, passed from hand to hand or stored. 

Of course, people felt no obligation to preserve books they didn't want (go to your local library used-book stalls and you'll see the same is true now), so many books were eventually discarded. The accidents of time - mildew, rats, bookworms, and most particularly fires and floods - destroy manuscripts faster than they are created (and, in very poor times, old books are [recycled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palimpsest) to reclaim the paper or vellum on which they are written). Occasionally, a political or religious movement will burn books; more often, wars and large fires will wipe out huge portions of a city at once. On the whole, such an environment is extremely hard on historical material. I'd hazard a guess that the "lifespan" of the average ancient book is probably measured in decades, rather than centuries. The books we do have are the 'greatest hits' - the ones that were so popular that they could not be wiped out. But they are a small minority of the books that were written and then lost. Overall I'd estimate the lifespan of most ancient books in decades, rather than centuries. 

Here's an example from modern times: I once had to dig a book on the history of the Hanseatic leagues out of the stacks at the Widener Library. It was really obscure and even thought it is printed, I doubt there are more than a few dozen copies floating around today. I was the only person who checked that book out between 1829 (!) and 1993. Now, that one was stored in a nice, safe, dry modern library -- but if it had been in a corner of a crowded monastery or stashed in the attic of a noble estate, would any but an antiquarian hesitate before tossing it out to make room for something else? It's not exactly a best seller.

In all societies before printing, preservation of records is extremely precarious. Before printing, even the most famous historical figures are rarely attested in more than a handful of direct sources.
