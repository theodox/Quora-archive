Part of the answer is certainly hubris - Alexander’s self-confidence is legendary.However the project actually originated with Alexander’s father [Philip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Macedon), who was far less of a romantic (or, if you prefer, megalomaniac). Philip was nothing if not calculating, so it’s worth asking what would convince a cautious, cynical old manipulator like him that the project was doable.

There were probably two distinct considerations that made Philip think a war against the Great King could be a profitable venture.

The first is simply __Persian politics.__ 

The Persians famously learned how to exploit the factionalism of the Greek world towards the end of the Peloponnesian war. Persian gold was the arbiter of Greek politics from about 415 BC down until the rise of Thebes around 370 BC. However the next decade was a period of rapid changes in Greece — and in Persia. In Greece, the Thebans overthrew the Spartan empire (which was, effectively, the Persian proxy in Greece). Meanwhile Persia had begun to show some of the same fissures that Greece had endured for centuries: the [Great Satraps' Revolt ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Satraps%27_Revolt)of 366–360 showed that Persians were not universally loyal to their emperor and that they, too could be motivated by money and greed.

Young Philip — who took the throne in 359 — could not help but realize that Persia was not really the terrifying monolith which Greeks historically believed. He hosted more than a few refugees from the Persian power-struggles at his court, providing himself with valuable intelligence on the real political situation inside Persia. Alexander’s famous willingness to cut deals with the Persian nobility reflects his insight into the fact that the “barbarians” were anything but a faceless other: they were just as corruptible as the Greeks.

The other big change in the odds on the ground was __military.__ This, too, hearkens backs to Philip’s youth.

Around 370 (while Philip was still a hostage in Thebes, observing the revolutionary military innovations of Epaminondas), the Athenian general Xenophon published his _[Anabasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabasis_(Xenophon))_ __ — the story of his career as a Greek mercenary fighting on behalf of the rebellious Persian prince [Cyrus the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Younger). Xenophon’s mercenary army— the famous “[10,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Thousand)” — accompanied Cyrus deep into Mesopotamia. where they formed the heavy infantry core of the pretender’s army. On the field of [Cunaxa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cunaxa), in 401, the Greeks won the field — but Cyrus dies on the battlefield, leaving his supporters stranded about 50 miles from Babylon in the heart of the Persian empire.

Xenophon’s book has been famous ever since as a ‘boy’s-own-adventure’ tale, showing how the Greeks kept themselves together as a fighting force in the middle of an hostile, alien environment. But it was also, in some ways, the death-knell of the Persian empire. Xenophon’s tale showed, quite vividly, that Greek infantry alone, without allies (apart from the occasional shifty Persian satrap who wanted to use them against his rivals) could march from from the heart of Iraq to the coast of the Black Sea — a six month’s march of more than four hundred miles — _and survive._ Of the 10,000 Greeks who survived Cunaxa, more than 6000 returned to Greece. The Great King’s vast armies could not stop them.

There’s a reason that one popular ancient accountof Alexander’s conquests [borrowed the title Anabasis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anabasis_of_Alexander)

So: those were the two calculations that convinced Philip that Persia was not invincible. His enterprise was still a colossal gamble — a roll of the dice greater than any in Greek history — but it was not just a grand romantic gesture. Like everything Philip did, it was cannily calculated. Alexander added glamor and chivalry — and a touch of battlefield charisma that Philip could not match — but the ultimate blueprint really belongs to his father.
