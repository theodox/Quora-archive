They absolutely did!

__Etruria__ 

Some of the Etruscan borrowings are quite famous: The Roman [fasces](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/fasces/), for example, derive from an Etruscan original:

_The Etruscan fasces had a double blade axe, but the idea is the same_ 

it’s frequently believed that gladiatorial games, for example, have an Etruscan origin (the word _arena_ , for example is probably Etruscan, and some ancient writers believed that the games were as well). The Roman practice of augury, particularly the variety where you predict the future by reading the entrails of sacrificial animals, is an Etruscan invention. Even the Latin word for ‘people,’ _populus_  — which in Roman terms mean “citizen body” — is Etruscan.

A hypothetical — but if true, a most critical — borrowing goes right to the heart of the Roman identity. It’s well known that the Romans believed (or at least, affected to believe) that they were descended from Trojan refugees, led by prince Aeneas who escaped the destruction of Troy. But there are a couple of reasons to think that they may have inherited this idea from the Etruscans. We know that Trojan war scenes are popular in Etruscan art:

There’s also an ancient tradition which claims that the Etruscans were themselves refugees from the neighborhood of Troy. Herodotus, for example, describes them as Lydians from Asia Minor. A claim of “Trojan” ancestry would be an easy, prestigious way for Anatolian-descended Etruscans to describe themselves to their Greek neighbors, just as other peoples around the Mediterranean found ways to write themselves into Greek myths. Knowing that, it’s tempting to imagine the Etruscanized Roman upper class, living under the Etruscan kings of the sixth century BC, borrowing that idea and eventually creating the “Roman=Trojan” equation which was so important for Latin literature.

__Carthage__ 

The Carthaginian borrowings are more subtle, and might be hard to tease out thanks to the long conflict between Rome and Carthage, which encouraged the Romans to downplay their debt to a hated enemy. However early Rome (particularly in the first two centuries of the Republic) generally had friendly relations with Carthage. In those days Rome was a minor landlocked power, frequently fighting its Greek and Etruscan neighbors; the Carthaginians were a maritime power, frequently fighting the same enemies, so friendly relations made sense.

You can see Carthaginian influence at Rome in the early period in the importance accorded to [Juno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(mythology)#Etrurian_Uni.2C_Hera.2C_Astarte_and_Iuno), the queen of the Roman pantheon. Linguistically, her name is associated with the Etruscan goddess Uni — but clearly both the Etruscan and Roman versions have some kind of relationship with the Carthaginian goddesses [Tanit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanit), whom the Romans knew as Juno Caelestis. Tanit was a very important goddess in Carthage, probably the most important member of the Carthaginian pantheon. Her prominent role is reflected in the the very prominent role of Juno at Rome — a very marked contrast with Hera in the Greek world. The huge role played by Juno, the presiding deity of Carthage and the opponent of Aeneas, in Virgil’s _Aeneid_  reflects the wary respect that the Romans awarded to the fierce Carthaginian goddess.

_“Juno Caelestis” — the Roman version of Carthaginian Tanit_ 

One a less exalted level, we know that the Romans were at least somewhat familiar with Carthaginian literature — sadly, now all lost to us. The agricultural handbook of [Mago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mago_(agricultural_writer)) was used by the Roman writer Columella, and the Romans were in general very impressed by Carthaginian agriculture, both before and after the Punic wars. The Romans also borrowed Carthaginian ship designs — as a nation of landlubbers they had to improvise a fleet quickly during the first Punic war, and they based some of their ships off of captured Carthaginian designs.
