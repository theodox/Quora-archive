The Romans conquered ‘Mesopotamia’ briefly under [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Parthian_campaign) in 115–16. The exact borders of the conquest aren’t really clear: the area was abandoned again under Hadrian in a few years, so it didn’t leave a deep impact on the area or in Roman sources. And the area was much diminished from its former glory: according to Cassius Dio

> Trajan… he had gone there [to Babylon] both because of its fame — though he saw nothing but mounds and stones and ruins to justify this — and because of Alexander, to whose spirit he offered sacrifice in the room where he had died.

They also conquered the Parthian captial at [Seleucia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucia) / [Ctesiphon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesiphon), which in this period was far larger and more important than Babylon; the twin cities were one of the largest conurbations in the world at that date.

The campaign was a bit less impressive than it appears on a map: the Parthian empire was in the midst of a civil war and there was very little effective opposition. After Trajan visited Babylon and the Persian Gulf, a rebellion in the newly-conquered territories, along with a rising in Judea by Jewish nationalists, threw the whole region into turmoil.

Trajan died the next year, and his successor Hadrian decided that the new territories were not worth the cost. He made peace with the Parthians and pulled the Roman frontier back to the western bank of the Euphrates.



This story is, parenthetically, a great example of how spotty our sources for ancient history can be: the most powerful of all Roman emperors conquers one of the most famous parts of the ancient world: what we have is a cut-down summary of [Dio’s Book 68,](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cassius_dio/68*.html) a paragraph [Eutropius’ biographical dictionary ](http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans8.html)and some [Byzantine crib notes](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/arrian/arrians-parthica-photius-excerpt/) from nearly a millenium later — hardly anything else.
