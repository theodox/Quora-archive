[Anuj Velankar](https://www.quora.com/profile/Anuj-Velankar)'s answer covers the main types for the late Republic through the fifth century or so. Ships of around 100 tons with a crew of 250-300 and a length in the ballpark of 30 meters were pretty much the upper limit throughout that time.

Different rulers -- usually of the megalomaniac variety -- tried building larger ship: Ptolemy's giant [Tessarakonteres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessarakonteres)

was too large to actually move very much, and probably represented the upper limit of what could be accomplished with the materials and techniques available. FWIW the original source puts the height of this one at 48 cubits, or about 72 feet from keel to crows nest, with a length of 280 cubits (= 320 feet). For comparison the HMS Victory (a 100 gun warship from the Napoleonic wars) displaced 3000 tons, was about 225 feet long at the waterline. and was about 260 feet from keel to masthead: a lot was learned between 1400 and 1800!

On the commercial side the Ptolemies -- megalomania again -- also built a fleet of elephant transports so they could capture African elephants for their armies and sail them up the east coast of Africa to [Berenice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenice_Troglodytica). These ships were notable in antiquity for having very deep draught:



> The ships which carry the elephants, being of deep draft because of their weight and heavy by reason of their equipment, involve their crews in great and terrible dangers. Since they run under full sail and often are driven before the force of the winds during the night, sometimes they strike the rocks and are wrecked, at other times they run aground on slightly submerged spits. The sailors cannot go over the sides of the ships because the water is deeper than a manâ€™s height (Diodorus Siculus)




Later in the Roman period there were some significant changes. One detail which is not well understood is the introduction of [Lateen sails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateen). it's not clear exactly when they showed up; some sources think they are a Roman invention (as early as the 1st century) others assert a Persian or Arab origin (8th or 9th). Another big change -- again undated -- is the crossover from shell construction where the hull of the ship is basically self-supporting -- to skeletal construction using planks on ribs, which tends to be stronger and support larger ships.

_this is a byzantine example, so notably later than the question period but gives a good idea of the layout of a dromon._ 

Late Roman [dromons ](https://ferrebeekeeper.wordpress.com/tag/dromon/)used lateen rigs and seem to have been been skeletally built: they dropped the ram which was common in Hellenistic designs, presumably because skeletal ships were tougher to break apart by ramming. Higher freeboards and forecastles were adopted compared to the low-slung profile of earlier mediterranean shipping, since maneuverability became less important and arrow or catapult fire became moreso. Unlike older Roman ships dromons seem to have two masts or more masts.
