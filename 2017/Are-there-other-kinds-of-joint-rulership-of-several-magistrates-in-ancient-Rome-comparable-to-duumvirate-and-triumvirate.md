Collegial magistracies were the norm in Rome, and the nomenclature reflects that. It’s just the Latin way of saying ‘group of so many’ — a habit which lasted all the way down to the Renaissance, where the Florentine government was full of groups like the Five of the Countryside, the Eight of Custody, and the Ten of War.

Off the top of my head:

There were _quinqueviri_ and later on _septemviri_ in charge of the [Epulones, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epulones)the main priestly groupings

There were many different kinds of _decemviri_ , the most famous group running the city in 450 BC as part of an[ effort to reconcile the plebeians and patricians](https://www.britannica.com/topic/decemviri).

The biggest numbered one was, I think, the _[quindecimviri sacris faciundis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quindecimviri_sacris_faciundis)_ _,_ another priestly group.

And of course the ordinary aediles, quaestors, praetors, tribunes and consuls were all collegial magistracies. The romans really didn’t like vesting power in single individuals…. until they vested all the power in one.
