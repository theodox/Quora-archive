as [User-10661484422791150723](https://www.quora.com/profile/User-10661484422791150723)'s links point out, it's always a good idea to remember that what we get to read is filtered through long-vanished politics. If you tried to reconstruct the careers of George W. Bush and Barack Obama a millenium from now using a random selection of a few hundred tweets about each you might get extremely... exaggerated... ideas about what the last 15 years have been like. 

That said, there is enough evidence to suggest that serious behavioral issues were a problem for a lot of Emperors.

I think I'd probably divide them up into two categories. The first -- and probably the most numerous -- is garden variety occupational paranoia: the perpetual fear of a ruler who had little legitimacy and felt himself (rightly or wrongly) to be surrounded by potential enemies. [Tiberius](http://www.ancient.eu/Tiberius/) and [Domitian](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Domitian) are good examples of this type. Their behavior in office was 'insane' in the sense of being capricious and unjust, but it was entirely logical for the standpoint of self-preservation: one imagines that either of them could have an interesting dinner party in Hell with Stalin, Mao, or Idi Amin where they compared notes about the right way to keep all of your subordinates at each other's throats. Perhaps significantly this kind of terroristic rule seems to crop up among successors to popular emperors or in those with popular rivals (eg, [Caracalla](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Caracalla)). Political enemies can make this seen more lurid but the essence of this kind of behavior is entirely practical: it's ruthless self-preservation, not 'madness' except in so far as it's sociopathic.

The more cinematic cases of madness are rarer, and they tend to crop up among 'designated successors' - young men who had been groomed for succession from youth. This was not the majority case among emperors: hereditary succession was never the official rule, and far more emperors got to the throne through adult adoption than through birth: It wasn't until the Byzantine era that ['born to the purple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyrogennetos)' became an official ideal. Augustus himself created a system where several potential heirs were raised as possible future candidates, rather than a straightforward grant of the title to a single, predictable heir. Most other emperors used similar strategies -- Roman aristocrats had always used adoption as a tool for strengthening their families so this made obvious sense. 

However, that flexible, malleable system pushed the rivalries and paranoia of adult politics down into the lives of young people. Worse, these were young people surrounded by ambitious groups of hangers-on and favorites who had everything to gain if their preferred candidates got to the throne. This was not exactly good character training. Older Roman aristocratic families had a highly evolved system for grooming young men for their roles in the Republic. The Empire never really developed anything as effective for it's own future leaders. Apart from Darwinian selection for ruthlessness the education of young emperors had little to recommend it.

In some ways there's an analogy is what happens to child stars, compounded with the eminently logical paranoia of unpopular dictators. If you spend your formative years in an an environment where your every wish is, literally, someone's command you get a very unhealthy sense of the limits of your powers. If you compound that with a winner-take all competition (where coming in second probably gets you killed, as happened to [Britannicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Britannicus), [Tiberius Gemellus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Gemellus), [Geta](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Publius_Septimius_Geta) and others) the outcomes aren't pretty. You end up with the classic profile of the bad emperor: a hair-trigger sense of threat that leads to poisonings, assassinations and proscriptions augmented by a perpetually adolescent desire to push boundaries. The showiest forms of madness -- Caligula [making his horse a senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Incitatus), Commodus [fighting as a gladiator](http://www.roman-empire.net/highpoint/commodus.html), Nero's [career as a stage musician](http://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/nero), and pretty much everything [Elagabalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Elagabalus) ever did -- seem at least in part to be trolling on an epic scale: the behavior of a bratty adolescent who has never been held to account and will keep pushing boundaries until somebody, finally, stands up to him. The career of [Julia u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_the_Elder)nder Augustus, of [Livilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livilla) under Tiberius, and displays the same kind of recklessness and immaturity as those of the more famously erratic emperors.

Exactly where the line between "behavioral issues" and organic disorders lie is hard to tell even in our contemporaries. Some emperors seem to exhibit traits of clinical mental illness: Nero's [mommy issues](http://fascinatinghistory.blogspot.com/2005/05/nero-and-agrippina.html), for example, seem to be more than just political or behavioral tics, and Caligula exhibited [some symptoms](http://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/madness-caligula-002132) that clinicians have tried to identify with a thyroid condition. Given a large enough sample, you will come up with some genuine cases of madness. However the 'bad boy emperor' stereotype had a lot to do with the failure of Roman society to come up with a way to breed up responsible future rulers. The truly amazing achievement of Roman society is to have survived in spite of recurring failures at the top.
