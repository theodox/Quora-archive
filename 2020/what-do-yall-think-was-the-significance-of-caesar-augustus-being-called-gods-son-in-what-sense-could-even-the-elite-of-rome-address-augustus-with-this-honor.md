The short answer is that the significance was __political__ : the “god” in question (more on the word choice in a second) was __Julius Caesar__ , who was Octavian-turned-Augustus’ adoptive father.

Augustus’s political power was a direct result of his position in the Caesarian faction — it’s how he was able to raise an army of veterans to fight for him in the civil wars as a teenager who had never held political office. He _never_ let anyone forget that he was a Julius Caesar, even though his birth name was Gaius Octavius Thurinus. By Roman convention, as an adoptive son he should have changed to “Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus”, honoring his natural father as well as his adoptive one:. In practice, however he was furious with anyone who dared address him by that name. It was — to use an very deliberate analogy — a lot like publicly addressing Comrade Stalin as “Josip Vissarionovich.”

The other thing is that the title is actually _divi filius,_ which is closer to “son of the deified” than to “son of the god”. A _divus_  was a mortal who merited some kind of special attention in the afterlife because of their achievements on earth. In Greek that sort of person was a “[hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_hero_cult)” — a good example is Hercules or Theseus (or in a Roman context, Romulus), believed to be a mortal but one who achieved a different kind of afterlife than the rest of us.

Julius Caesar’s deification (“canonization” is probably a lot more accurate: in later Christian Latin _divus_  is often used for _saint_ ) was the first officially recognized one in Rome. The practice of stressing your “descent” from the “deified” became standard: any Roman emperor who was the adoptive heir of his predecessor — and many were — would use D.F. or _divi filius_  to emphasize that connection.

On the right, the temple of Julius erected in the Roman forum where he was cremated, decorated with_ _[Caesar's Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_Comet)_ _, which supposedly appeared in the sky announcing Caesars ascencion._ 

Since the question asked about elite Romans in particular, the D.F. was intended and perceived as a pointed reminder of who was in charge. Though Julius Caesar and Augustus were both themselves aristocrats, the Caesarian political apparatus was publicly identified with populism. Conservative Roman aristocrats regarded the “divinity” of their emperors with cynicism at best — Seneca’s [Apocolocyntosis](https://www.ancient-literature.com/rome_seneca_apocolocyntosis.html) is a savage satire of Claudius’ reception into the afterlife, and emperor Vespasians last words were “dear me, I think I’m becoming a god.”

Farther from the center of power it’s harder to judge people’s sincerity but it’s quite clear that public devotion to the imperial cult was an important avenue of social mobility — all across the empire, appointments to the local temple were the deified former emperors were honored were highly coveted by local elites anxious to demonstrate their loyalty. The post was a common steppingstone for ambitious provincials who wanted to get involved in imperial politics.
