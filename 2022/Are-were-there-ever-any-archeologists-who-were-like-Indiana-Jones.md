Don’t let that nicely conditioned beard and those melting brown eyes fool you: [The Great Belzoni ](https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/meet-the-great-belzoni-the-italian-indiana-jones-and-other-egyptology-pioneers)(more properly, [Giovanni Battista Belzoni, 1778–1823](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Giovanni-Battista-Belzoni)) was pretty bad news. Be you a desert bandit or a priceless Egyptian relic, when Belzoni was on the prowl you wanted to be _someplace else_ .

_You want swashbuckling archaeology? Here._ 

Belzoni was, literally, one of the giants of archaeology — he stood 6′7.″ In fact before he took up the trowel he worked as a a circus strongman under the stage name “The Patagonian Samson.” The climax of his act was lifting twelve people at once — a feat that almost certainly involved a little hidden mechanical help. However Belzoni was quite capable of designing the _deus ex machina_  for his own act: before the circus he had been a hydraulic engineer. And before that, Capuchin monk. Belzoni got around.

In 1815 as the Napoleonic wars were finally winding down, Belzoni went to Egypt in hoping to sell a new mechanical water pump of his own design to Muhammad Ali (yes, really… [just a different one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Pasha)). The Pasha wasn’t biting, however, and Belzoni’s trip looked like a bust. However the recovery of the Rosetta Stone had kicked off a wave of [Egyptomania](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/features/what-is-egyptomania) in Europe and the acquisition of antiquities was becoming a form of prestige competition among European elites. So Belzoni the engineer figured he could cash in by using his skills to extract a notable Egyptian relic, the so-called “[Younger Memnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Memnon)” — a 7-ton granite bust of Ramesses II.

Of course, this was long before the existence of heritage commissions and classes on archaeological ethics. Napoleon had wanted Memnon for himself, and his engineers had actually drilled into the wickedly hard basalt of the bust (the hole is visible in the photo above) intending to simply blow it up, since it would so much more convenient to ship just the pieces. Thankfully they were distracted — thanks, Admiral Nelson! — and it took Belzoni’s engineering skills and his ability to dragoon local laborers to spirit Memnon/Rameses off to the British Museum, where he remains to this day.

This whetted the strongman’s appetite for Egyptian treasure, and for the next several years he made the rounds of Egypt’s most visible remains. This was the heyday of crowbar archaeology: “notes and sketches be damned,“ was the motto, “where’s the loot?” Belzoni’s methods were not particularly egregious by the standards of the day: as an engineer, he was willing to work with leverage and patience where many of his rivals resorted to gunpowder. Still, it doesn’t buy him a lot of tolerance from exasperated moderns.

We can nonetheless be grateful that it was [Belzoni who found the entrance to the Pyramid of Khafre](https://analog-antiquarian.net/2019/03/29/chapter-6-khafre-and-the-giant/), fifty feet below the sands of Giza rather than his great rival, the [French consul Drovetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardino_Drovetti), who was lobbying for permission to simply blow the pyramid open.

_Belzoni’s workers entering the base of the pyramid of Khafre, 1818 — this entrance was actually created by ancient tomb robbers and was a false lead._ 

Belzoni wasn’t just a dab hand with a pickaxe: he developed a lot of respect for Egyptian builders. His first entry into the pyramid followed the trail of ancient tomb robbers and proved to be a harrowing, unstable dead-end. He nearly gave up in despair — but the arrival of other Europeans on the scene, which meant competition, inspired him to a clever guess. He realized that the tomb robbers hadn’t actually hit median line of the pyramid’s face; the original builders, he was sure, were not so sloppy. So he dug sideways to find the actual midpoint of the pyramid’s north face and was rewarded with the actual entrance.

_The true entrance to the pyramid, 9 meters to the east of the false opening._ 

Within the pyramid, Belzoni found what seemed like yet another dead end. A hundred feet in the passage ended in a solid block of granite. Or did it? To the engineers eye it became apparent that the “wall” before him was actually a kind of gate which descended from the ceiling. There were, however, no spring-loaded traps or riddles which would move the massive stone: instead, it took careful engineering work in the cramped tunnel to lever the granite blockage up and out of the way. Carefully propping up the massive gate lest it fall again and trap them, Belzoni and his crew navigated a sheer 5-meter drop and then another passage which brought them to an impressive finished chamber at the heart of the pyramid.

Only to discover that they were not the first — the chamber was almost empty. It did however contain the broken head of a hatchet and an Arabic graffito from 1372. From various attacks on walls and floors it looks like the Arab delvers had been equally disappointed: the tomb was bare apart from an enormous granite sarcophagus. In the end Belzoni’s reward for months of labor was the chance to leave his own signature in the empty royal chamber. He also made a thorough survey of the chamber and the passages: he may have been questing for gold but at least Belzoni believed in documentation.

Fame is all well and good, but money matters too. The early excavators were fiercely competitive, because they hoped to find not merely striking antiquities but also treasure. Intrigues at court, bribery of officials, and fights among rival work gangs were common. Gunfire between rival excavators was not unheard of. The British and French residents in Cairo both saw excavations as matters of national prestige so the competition also took on elements of a Cold War thriller. Belzoni was backed by the British, where his chief rival Drovetti was the head of the French legation. The excavation of the [Philae Obelisk](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/kingston-lacy/features/the-philae-obelisk) was a particular flashpoint —it included legal difficulties, dockside brawls, and even an exchange of gunfire between British and French expeditions. Indiana Jones’ cinematic rivalry with Belloq was largely [inspired by Belzoni’s clashes with Drovetti](https://detritusofempire.blogspot.com/2011/12/belzoni-as-indiana-jones.html).

Even in his own day Belzoni’s fame came with an asterisk. In the London of the 1820’s an enormous Italian of no particular family or education was never going to be more than a curiosity — to this day the British Museum still credits the Memnon bust to [Henry Salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Salt_(Egyptologist)), the British diplomat who hired Belzoni, not the man who organized the actual extraction, transport, and shipping.

In modern times, his reputation is even more dubious,. Like Indiana Jones, his adventures tend to horrify conscientious modern archaeologists. This sounds like like a _Raiders_ scene

> my weight bore down on the body of an Egyptian, it crushed it like a band-box … so that I sunk altogether among the broken mummies, with a crash of bones, rags and wooden cases

This might give laypeople a twinge of the macabre, but for practicing archaeologists it’s a horror story of a different kind. Belzoni has been described as “the greatest plunderer of them all” by the Archaeological Association of America and derided by National Geographic as “a notorious tomb robber,” if not a Tomb Raider.

While he was definitely a product of a much rougher and readier brand of archaeology he wasn’t a complete barbarian. He developed a deep love for the art and culture of Egypt. He was a gentler excavator than many of his contemporaries, and his measurements were as precise as you’d expect from an engineer. His early career in irrigation taught him to recognize the telltale signs of water flow, even in a desert — that’s what helped him spot the buried entrance to the temple of Rameses at Abu Simbel. In fact the scene in _Raiders_  where Indy uses the moment of sunrise to find the location of Tanis owes a good bit to Belzoni’s excavation of the temple of Abu Simbel in 1817 — after a brutal dig (temperatures reached 124°F / 51°C) finally cleared the entrance. But despite the excitement he waited to the next morning to enter the temple for the first time in over a millennium: he knew that the door was aligned to the rising sun and would be flooded with light at sunrise.

His first sight of the buried hall was thus truly cinematic in two different ways — and it certainly gives him a claim on the title of “like Indiana Jones”
