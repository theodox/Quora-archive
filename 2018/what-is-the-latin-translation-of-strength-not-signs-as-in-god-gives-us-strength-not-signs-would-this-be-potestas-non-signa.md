# What is the Latin translation of "Strength, not signs"? As in, “God gives us strength, not signs.” Would this be, “Potestas non signa?”

I’d try _dona nobis vim, non signum,_ using the singular _signum_ instead of the plural _signa_ in order to make a neat parallel with _vim._ The word order is more or less up to you, although starting with _dona nobis_  parallels _dona nobis pacem_ , “grant us peace”, in the old Latin mass.

You could use _fortitudinem_  rather than _vim;_ _[fortitudo](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=fortitudo&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059)_ stresses the power of endurance, where [vis ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Vis&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059)is more like “force” or “vigor”. The former might be more appropriate in a religious context but the latter makes a nice pun, since the _vis_  of a word (or a “sign”) is its meaning.

__Edit__ 

Looks like the question changed from “God give…” to “God _gives_ …”; in that case you’d want _deus nobis [vim/fortitudinem], non signum donat_
