In "Roman times" Rome did dominate the western European economy to a tremendous degree. After the end of the [Second Punic War ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Punic_War)(ended 200BC) when Rome's major western rival, Carthage, was reduced to a second-class power until Rome was [sacked by the Goths in 410AD,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(410)) Rome was the largest and most economically important city in Europe and the western Mediterranean. Just for comparison purposes, the population of the city of Rome itself around 100 AD, at 1 million or so, was in the same ballpark as the population of Britain (all of it!) at the same time. 

However this was a pre-industrial era: the population of the city reflected political and military power, not industrial production. Beginning in the third century that power began to ebb away from the city itself, and while the city remained wealthy real power lay in the hands of the soldier-emperors who spent more and more time on distant frontiers -- or fighting civil wars against other military dynasts. Among other serious problems, Italy was incapable of feeding itself and depended on massive grain shipments from Egypt and North Africa. 

In the fourth and especially the fifth centuries the combination of political instability and a series of deadly plagues rendered the giant city untenable. The sack of 410 was not actually a terrible massacre -- but huge sections of the populations left and never returned, because the weak governments of the 400's could not guarantee the grain supplies and political largess on which the city depended. Without artificial stimulation the city's population plummeted -- by 550 the city's population has declined to less than 50,000 people where it will hover until the Renaissance. However it's worth remembering that 'New Rome' - that is the Byzantine capital Constantinople (modern Istanbul) was the largest city in the western Hemisphere for another 500 years or so: in those days political power came first and economic power tended to follow.

During the Renaissance Italy was again, for a while, the economic epicenter of Europe. The Italian city states invented modern banking and dominated international trade. However Italian demographics could not keep pace with changes in the rest of Europe: during the Middle Ages, agriculture in northern Europe had far surpassed what the Romans knew how to do outside their own Mediterranean homelands. France and Germany, in particular, far surpassed their Roman-era peak populations but Italy did not (North Africa and Egypt were still under the control of hostile Muslim powers, and North African agriculture was also much less productive in this period). Moreover the Black Death hit prosperous, urban Italy much harder than it did the more rural countries to the north.

So Italy's economic dominance was quickly eclipsed by political developments: The [French invasion of Italy in 1494](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_War_of_1494%E2%80%9398) demonstrated that big, centralized kingdoms -- even without the cultural and economic sophistication of the wealthy Italians -- were more powerful on the battlefield than the perennially disunited city-states.

_The_ _[Sack of Rome (1527)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(1527))_ _was the clearest demonstration of Italian impotence in the face of other big European powers_  

Over the next fifty years outside powers carved up much of Italy into client states and reduced the rest to the status of minor powers. This situation lasted until the middle of the 19th century: the modern nation of Italy did not become a unified state until [1861](http://www.britannica.com/event/Risorgimento). Meanwhile many of the key developments of modernity -- in literature, art, science, technology and economics - were taking place in northern Europe. Italy has been playing catch-up ever since.
