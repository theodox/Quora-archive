It’s one of those _you-can’t-escape-your-destiny_  things with which Greek mythology abounds. His vulnerability isn’t something he actually knew about specifically; there’s no actual point where somebody tells him he should watch out for his heels.

He does, however, get told many times over that he’ll die if he goes out to fight Hector:

> ‘For my mother Thetis the goddess of the silver feet tells me I carry two sorts of destiny toward the day of my death. Either, if I stay here and fight beside the city of the Trojans, my return home is gone, but my glory shall be everlasting; but if I return home to the beloved land of my fathers, the excellence of my glory is gone, but there will be a long life left for me, and my end in death will not come to me quickly.’

He goes out knowing full well what’s going to happen. The choice to embrace glory or long life is the central conflict of his character.
