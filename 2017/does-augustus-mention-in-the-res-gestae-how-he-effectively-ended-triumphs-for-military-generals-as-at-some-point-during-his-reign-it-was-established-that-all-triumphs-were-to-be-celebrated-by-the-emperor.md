No. There’s a fairly complete text here — [The Internet Classics Archive](http://classics.mit.edu/Augustus/deeds.html)

The disappearance of the triumph had more to do with his persistent efforts — logical, in a former military coup leader — to make sure that no military leader ever got into a position to threaten him.
