You don’t want to get your ancient travel times or distances from Google Maps. Generally water transport was faster and cheaper than land, and land routes had to stick to well known routes which were adapted for foot and animal traffic. The straight line on the map is rarely the actual route.

The [Stanford Orbis project](https://orbis.stanford.edu/) does a great job of guesstimating travel routes and times within the Roman Empire based on literary and archaeological data. Here’s a reasonable Antioch to Tarsus route for the first century:

As you can see from the legend it takes 5–6 days and covers 288 kilometers. Most of the travel is by water, sailing coastwise by daylight — but most of the _time_  (more than 3 days) is on the overland leg between Tarsus and the port at Katabolos. In the winter, the trip would probably take an extra day.
