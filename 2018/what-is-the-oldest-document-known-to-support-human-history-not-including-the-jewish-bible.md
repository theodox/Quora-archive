To some degree it depends what you mean by “historical document”. The oldest _writings_  go back a few centuries before 3,000 BC, but they are rarely concerned with what we’d call history. Most of them are recordkeeping — inventories and receipts. The rest are religious or magical texts.

The first effort to write down events intended as a record of the past is the [Palermo Stone](http://www.ancientegyptonline.co.uk/palermostone.html), is a kind of royal chronicle, covering events in the first five dynasties of Egyptian history. It records the names of the kings and their mothers along with notable events for the different reigns, though it does not make an effort to tell stories. It’s an annotated timeline, not a narrative.

_The Palermo Stone_ 

We’re not really sure when the stone was created — some Egyptologists believe it was created during the fifth dynasty, some time after 2500 BC. Others think the stone is a later creation, possibly as much as 1,700 years later.

On the other hand if you take a stricter view of “historical document” — if you want a continuous narrative rather than a bare list of data — then the honors go to the Sumerian poem known as [Gilgamesh and Aga](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1811.htm). It tells the story of a war between Gilgamesh, king of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, and a more powerful rival, king Aga of Kish.

Unlike other stories associated with Gilgamesh, it has no supernatural elements — it shows him as an embattled leader, thwarted by a reluctant city council that does not want to fight and opposed by a more powerful human enemy. Aga is a historical person; many sources, including the Gilgamesh story, refer to him as the son of [Enmebaragesi,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enmebaragesi) who is the oldest Mesopotamian king whose existence is confirmed by archeology. [Gilgamesh](https://www.ancient.eu/gilgamesh/) was considered to be a mythical figure until the discovery of the Gilgamesh-Aga story, but is now seen as a historical king who lived sometime before 2500 BC. He later acquired a mythical afterlife in the [epic which made him famous](http://www.ancient-literature.com/other_gilgamesh.html).

Our oldest copy of the Gilgamesh-Aga text dates to about 2000 BC, several centuries after the events it depicts, and a couple of hundred years before the oldest known version of the more mythologized epic. It’s the oldest third-person historical narrative we know of.

The Sumerians also produced a series of documents known as “king lists”, listing of kings with minimal annotations very similar to the Palermo stone. The oldest of these dates to about 2,000 BC; if the Palermo stone really is a late copy then these would be rivals to the Gilgamesh-Aga text for the title of oldest historical document.
