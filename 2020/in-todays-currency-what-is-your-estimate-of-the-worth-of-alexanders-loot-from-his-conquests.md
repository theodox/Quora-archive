> Ancient money numbers are a mug’s game, and this is a heavily simplified estimate that ignores a lot of the the subtleties that specialists argue over. If you really want a look at whats under the kimono — er, the chlamys — you should check out [The Treasures of Alexander the Great](https://amzn.to/39J8Avl), by Frank Holt.

This will have to be a low number, since once you get into estimating things like the value of artworks, land, or slaves taken as prisoners of war the numbers will be entirely based on guesses. However we do have unusually firm-sounding numbers for the actual monetary value of Alexander’s conquests — though like most numbers associated with antiquity you have to assume a lot of rounding. The ancient sources don’t agree precisely among themselves, but they converge roughly on a figure between 180,000 (Diodorus), 190,000, (Justin) and 202,000 (Curtius) talents of ‘silver.’ Since Diodorus seems to have miscounted and actually lists 190,000 while _saying_  180,000, I’ll use 190,000 talents as a baseline but you could adjust all subsequent numbers up or down by about 5%.

_A silver tetradrachm of Alexander. One talent produced about 1500 of these; the Persian treasury contained enough silver to mint about two hundred million and an additional eleven million each year. Nowadays poor examples cost around $60 each but high quality ones can be more then $2,000._ 

There’s also good 10–15% of slop since It’s not actually clear which of the many competing values for “a talent” our authors are thinking of; the Attic variety was 26 kg (or about 57 lbs) but the Babylonian talent was 30 kg / 66 lbs). It’s pretty common in English sources to use 30 kg as the reference value.

So, today’s silver price is $587.89 per kilogram, according to [this site](https://goldprice.com/silver-price-per-kilo/). So the raw monetary haul — excluding art works, portable goods, etc — works out to the surprisingly round value of __$3,350,973,000__ if we split the difference between the high and low numbers and use 30kg talents. It’s a bit depressing that Harvard has almost fifteen times more money in the bank than Darius III had.

But it’s important to remember that this value, though it’s quoted in silver — which was the standard accounting measure for the Greeks — is not actually a weigh-in. Probably about 30% of the value, give or take, was actually gold not silver. In antiquity gold was typically valued around 12:1 compared to silver — but today the ratio is a whopping_85:1_  or so. Thus, __if 30% of Alexander’s treasure was really gold, our $3.3 billion figure becomes $90,497,600,400.__ This is a good example of why these kinds of numbers need to be treated with appropriate caution! Now, at least, conquering the entire Near East is about twice as profitable as conquering Cambridge, Mass.

The conquest of the empire also means taking over its annual revenues. Based on [Herodotus’ account of the Persian tributes](http://Uhttps://qr.ae/T3l2mo), the annual income of the Persian empire was about 7600 talents of silver and 360 talents of gold. That’s $134,038,920 per year in silver and $556,748,964 per year in gold (at $51,550.83/ kg) for a combined total of __$690,787,884 per year.__ That’s roughly the same revenue footing as a different set of warriors: the Golden State Warriors who bring in around $700m per year.

However, if you look at the conquest of the Persian empire as a classic hostile takeover, you also need to think about it in terms of price-earnings ratio. Today’s S&P traded at a P/E of exactly 24. Against Alexander’s annual revenue, a similar P/E would equate to a __market valuation of $16,578,909,216.__ 

Thus, if you include both asset value and future earnings, you’re talking $16.5 billion in “capitalization” and $90 billion in assets based purely on the weight of metal in Alexander’s treasuries — __about $106.5 billion overall with maybe 15% slop__ to account for different talent values, the ratio of gold to silver, and what the real multiplier on the P/E ratio of a multinational empire ought to be (as Alexander’s successors proved quite conclusively, there were plenty of corporate raiders ready to disassemble such a big conglomerate!).

$106 billion is a lot — but not a lot when you realize it includes the tax revenues of most of today’s Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. On that accounting Alexander would be worth more than Warren Buffet ($88 bn) but less than Bill Gates ($108 billion). But then again, Alexander is a god and not even Jeff Bezos can say that_(publicly)._ 



Another way to think about this, however, is in __purchasing power parity__ . A single drachma (here, we’ll stick with notional silver) represented a day’s skilled labor (a carpenter, say, or a mercenary soldier). There are 6,000 drachmae in a talent. So, if you used this year’s average wage for carpenters in the US ($21.66 / hr), a drachma represents $ 173.28 and a talent just over a million dollars. That would convert the value of the Persian treasury into __$190 billion__  and the annual revenues would be an additional __$11.92 billion__ (a bit more than Rupert Murdoch’s media empire)__.__ Converting the latter to a 24:1 P/E would make a combined total __$476 billion__ . At least, assuming you really wanted a lot of carpentry done (interestingly, carpentry wages are a little more competitive today than pay for infantry).

On the other hand purchasing parity is a highly debatable measure — if you think an ancient Greek carpenter could be replaced by a modern burger flipper, that drachma represents only about $60 and the total shrinks to something more like $165 billion. Still, on a PPP basis Alexander would actually outpace Jeff Bezos and be the richest man (or god) in the world.
