Not on a large scale, like the marriages which Alexander arranged between his top officers and women from the Persian nobility. Roman diplomacy evolved under the Republic, which did not have the option of creating “marriage alliances” since power changed hands on an annual basis. Eventually imperial Roman diplomacy did make use of marriage as a tool — but that’s a fairly late development.*

There was a definitely policy of bringing the children of influential foreigners to Rome as “hostages” (_captivi_ ). This served two purposes. The most obvious intention was to guarantee good behavior on the part of former enemies. However it was also seen as a way to spread Roman values and sympathy for Rome among the hostages, who would return home to act as informal ambassadors or, sometimes, as client rulers.

Among the _captivi_ the Romans occasionally did arrange marriages that were intended to strengthen Rome’s system of alliances and client states. Probably the most famous example is the marriage of Cleopatra’s daugher [Cleopatra Selene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_Selene_II) to [Juba II of Mauretania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II). This marriage rewarded Juba — who himself had been a hostage at Rome, and was friendly with emperor Augustus — with a prestigious bride and it also made sure the Cleopatra was married to a reliable ally: it might have been dangerous to allow someone with the blood of the Ptolemies to marry anyone she chose.

Outside of the strict rules of official policy, some Roman officers married influential members of the provincial elites; this was not a government policy but a form of social climbing. In the very upper ranks of the Roman nobility, marrying a foreigner (certainly a non-citizen) was uncommon — there was more prestige to be had by engineering an alliance with a high-status Roman family. However, most of the civil servants and military commanders who actually governed the empire were not from the Roman nobility : the emperors preferred not to put people with a lot of money and political clout in charge of armies or provinces. For this influential but less exalted group of Romans a match with a local royal family could be an enticing prospect.

For example, [Antonius Felix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonius_Felix) was the Roman procurator of Judea — a wealthy and powerful man, but only the son of a freedman (despite his name, his family were from Greece). Felix married two different princesses: [Drusilla of Mauretania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drusilla_of_Mauretania_the_Younger) (a princess of the client king of Mauretania) and [Drusilla of Judea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drusilla_(daughter_of_Herod_Agrippa)) (the daughter of [Herod Agrippa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_Agrippa), the last king of Judea). Felix’s son — who perished alongside the second Drusilla in the destruction of Pompeii — thus had a grandfather who was a slave and another who was a king.

Eventually the local elites of various client kingdoms merged with the Roman service elites to form a new aristocracy. A good example is emperor [Septimius Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus#Family_and_education): his paternal ancestry came from a wealthy but not noble Italian family, his mother’s family were wealthy Punic inhabitants of North Africa. He married (before he became emperor)[ a member of the royal family of Emesa, in Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Domna). There’s a recurring pattern in Roman history where “old money” tends to become more insular, snobbish, and exclusive while new money is more cosmopolitan — until it has been around long enough to start becoming exclusive in its own right.



* The most famous example is probably [Galla Placidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galla_Placidia#First_marriage), sister of emperor Honorius, who was married off to the Visigothic king Ataulf in reward for his support. A generation later her daughter [Justa Grata Honoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justa_Grata_Honoria) famously offered herself in marriage to Attila the Hun, precipitating an invasion by the “groom.” In general, however, Roman imperial marriages tended to stay within the imperial elite until the Byzantine period.
