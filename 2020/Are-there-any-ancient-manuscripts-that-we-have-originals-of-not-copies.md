# Are there any ancient manuscripts that we have originals of, not copies?

We don’t have anything you’d think of as important — no literary works, no histories, no memoirs. The only first-generation written material we have is incidental stuff: scraps of paperwork from Roman Egypt, for the most part, things like a petition in a court case or a tax registration that are “originals” in the sense that they’ve never been recopied.

There are two items, off the top of my head, mark the edges of the category of “originals” which survive, but they’re not paper.

The [Lyon Tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon_Tablet) records a speech by emperor Claudius on law which allowed Gauls to become members of the Roman Senate. This speech was recorded (or more accurately) paraphrased by Tacitus — most historians assumed it was standard-issue writely license until the tablet was found buried in a field in 1528. It’s obviously not Claudius’ manuscript but it looks to be an official copy, presumably one checked by people in a position to know if it was accurate.

In a similar vein the [Res Gestae Divi Augusti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_Gestae_Divi_Augusti) exists in the form of several copies inscribed on the walls of imperial temples, including a nearly complete one in Ankara. Again, this is not “the original” but unlike most of our manuscripts it was definitely created by people who had access to the original and who had the power of the Roman government making sure the copy was accurate.

Apart from those? Nothing. You’ll never find a piece of papyrus with Caesar or Cicero’s signature at the bottom. There are plenty of authentic inscriptions, of course, but for the most part they are short and formulaic; nobody went around inscribing novels or histories in stone.

Of course, we don’t have the originals for many things much closer to us in time. _Don Quixote,_ for example,__ was enormously popular — it’s first print run in 1605 included a whopping 400 copies. But fewer than three dozen of those survive. We do have about a dozen items written by Cervantes’ hand, but they are mostly letters. Apparently nobody thought it was necessary to keep the manuscript of the _Quixote_ once it was printed; or perhaps it was kept in an attic somewhere and moldered away. In any case the book had come to life and didn’t need to be specially protected: only a handful of people would ever interact with the original no matter what.

Hundreds or thousands of years after the fact, we are oppressed by how rare ancient texts are. But at the time they were created, they were not yet rare or precious: they were just words on paper seeking an audience. Copying was how that audience was to be found.

Copying was a hassle and an expense, to be sure — but it was also completely routine. We mentally underestimate the availability of books back then, because so many are gone _now_ . Even in the rare case where we actually possess manuscripts that are roughly contemporary with the originals, we often find multiple copies. For example the Dead Sea Scrolls contains a good deal of unique material, much of which seems to have been new when it was hidden in the first century. But even something so “rare” that we’d never heard of until the scrolls were found — like the [Serekh ha Yahad](http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/community) _—_ turns up to have existed in several copies in just that cache of scrolls.
