Gilgamesh is a semi-legendary king of [Uruk](http://www.ancient.eu/uruk/) (aka Erech, aka [Warka, Iraq ](http://www.cemml.colostate.edu/cultural/09476/iraq05-115.html)). He's the hero of the first written epic, originally in Sumerian about 5,000 years ago and subsequently popular throughout ancient Mesopotamia. 

There are multiple versions (just as there are many retellings of the Trojan war) but here's the basics:

In the story he starts off as a brave and powerful, but brash and tyrannical king who abuses his people. The gods send him a companion, an equally powerful warrior named Enkidu, and their friendship teaches Gilgamesh to be a more responsible leader. Gilgamesh and Enkidu set off on a journey (probably to the [cedars of Lebanon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedars_of_God)) to obtain wood for the city -- in treeless Mesopotamia, wood is a precious commodity. They defeat a mythical monster and obtain the treasure, but this attracts the attention of the goddess [Inanna](http://www.ancient.eu/Inanna/), who wants to take Gilgamesh as a lover. 

Unfortunately she has a habit of discarding her lovers in unpleasant ways, so Gilgamesh declines; the angry goddess sends a monster called the Bull of Heaven to punish the heroes. Together they defeat the bull, but this is a terrible sacrilege. As punishment, Enkidu is stricken with a wasting disease and dies. 

Gilgamesh, in his grief, decides to obtain the secret of eternal life. He embarks on a quest to find [Utnapishtim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utnapishtim), the only human ever to become immortal. Utnapishtim was the Sumerian version of Noah: is the survivor of a universal flood who built an ark and saved humanity from annihilation. Eventually Gilgamesh finds Utnapishtim. Gilgamesh fails a test designed to test his worthiness, but the holy man takes pity on him anyway and gives him a plant which will restore life and vigor. 

However, the exhausted hero falls asleep on his way home and the plant is stolen by a serpent -- which gains the ability to renew itself by shedding its skin. Heartbroken, the chastened king returns home to his city, sadder and resigned to mortality yet proud of his achievements as a ruler and a man.

Gilgamesh apparently also featured in several other stories, of which one ([Gilgamesh and Agga of Kish](http://www.piney.com/BabGilgAgga.html) ) is still preserved.
