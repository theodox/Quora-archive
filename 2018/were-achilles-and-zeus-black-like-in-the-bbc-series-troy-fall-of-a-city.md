Nope. Nope nope nope.

The ethnic origins of Achilles at least were quite clear. Achilles came from [Phthia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phthia) in Thessaly, He’s described in the Iliad as being ξανθός, _xanthos —_ what we’d call “dirty blonde” (there’s more on the vagaries of Greek hair and eye color terminology in [this answer](https://www.quora.com/Were-the-Ancient-Greeks-and-Romans-white/answer/Steve-Theodore?share=00965671&srid=zLvM)). Achilles’s son, [Neoptolemus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoptolemus), also went by the nickname Πύρρος, _Pyrrhos_ , “the redhead.” As it happens, Homer made a big deal about Achilles’ luxurious hair; the climax of his mourning for Patroclus is cutting off his golden locks. The show’s Achilles sports a neatly waxed and shaved scalp.*

Evidently the show also has a black [Aeneas](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/Z40t0S1xC8f7jMHFvNNx7d/aeneas) and a black [Nestor](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/1QKS8LL70fsYjdTf3qQbxLx/nestor-king-of-pylos). You might be able to make a case for the Nestor, since this comes from the right historical era and the site traditionally known as the Palace of Nestor.

Aeneas however is rather a stretch, considering that his mother Aphrodite (a redhead in the show) and his father is Anchises, a junior member of the (white) royal family of Troy. On the plus side — Aeneas is a distant ancestor of Julius Caesar, so you can have even more fun casting Roman period dramas in the future!

The one nontraditional casting choice you could defend on historic or literary grounds would be Zeus, since there’s an obscure but not unheard of version of Zeus known as “[Zeus Aethiops](http://www.mythindex.com/greek-mythology/A/Aethiops.htmlhttp://www.mythindex.com/greek-mythology/A/Aethiops.html)” or “black-faced Zeus”*. However I would be willing to bet a large sum, that the casting director didn’t know or care about _that_  factoid.

It’s seems obvious that the casting was (a) colorblind and (b) only mildly interested in the original material.** The defense mounted [here](http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-03-24/troy-fall-of-a-city-blackwashing-casting-black-actors-greek-myth/) seems disingenuous to me, although it at least bothers to dig up the fact the _Odyssey_  describes at one point Odysseus having dark skin and woolly hair…. though the Odysseus in this show does _not.***_ 

The underlying truth, though, is that this version of Troy looks like modern London, and that’s what the creators wanted — It’s Homer meets Hamilton. Accuracy regarding the 13th century BC Aegean or the 8th century BC world-view of the _Iliad_ is not what the creators of the show cared about, and it shows.



There, incidentally, one character in the Trojan war stories who could be described as an African without any verbal gymnastics: [Memnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memnon_(mythology)) who was traditionally described as a “prince of Aethiopia” — he was also one of the few heroes fighting on the Trojan side who could fight shield-to-shield against Achilles.

As an added plus for would-be casting directors, Greek geography was extremely vague about where exactly Aethiopia was — in early sources it sometimes refers to what we would call subsaharan Africa and sometimes to what we’d call India. By around the 6th century BC the former definition was becoming dominant, and although Greek would colloquially use “Aethiops” as a general term for dark-skinned people the place-name Aethiopia had become clearly associated with the historical Kushite kingdom of [Meroë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB) in modern-day Sudan. It’s not obvious where the author of the _Aethiopis,_ Memnon’s fragment of the epic cycle, thought Memnon came from — but by Roman times at least he was canonically described as an African, often wearing a lion or leopard skin. One Roman era writer[ describes his appearance in a painting as shocking the Greek heroes before Troy, who were unused to the sight of dark-skinned men](http://www.theoi.com/Text/PhilostratusElder2A.html).

*A later Greek writer claimed that Patroclus’s funeral marked the end of Homers’ “long-haired Achaeans” as they [cut off their long hair and became the crop-headed Greeks of historic times](https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/a-haircut-for-achilles-and-a-model-for-greeks-in-the-post-heroic-era/).
** Zeus Aethiops evidently has a [Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/people/Zeus-Aethiops/100001705579772) too. He really gets around!
***I’d add that it makes we want to downgrade [my defense of having a black Roman soldier in the BBC show Britannia](https://www.quora.com/People-are-complaining-about-the-sight-of-a-black-Roman-legionnaire-in-the-trailer-for-the-new-show-Britannia-Personally-I-imagine-that-black-legionnaires-were-nothing-special-in-a-multicultural-and-multiracial-Roman-army-Who-is-right/answer/Steve-Theodore?share=94acfca3&srid=zLvM). I doubt it’s about historical nuance — and, since the actor is clearly supposed to be a legionary, rather than an auxiliary, the odds are extremely long.
