The suggestion in the details is an exaggeration: while we have scantier sources for some kinds of things, we also have a lot of sources for more recent history that we don't have for Mesopotamian cultures -- in particular, a more or less unbroken oral tradition, which isn't really true for Mesopotamia. 

On the other hand, there were few states in Europe 1200 years ago with the resources to assemble the kinds of libraries that we've found in the [Library of Ashurbanipal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Ashurbanipal) or [Nippur](http://www.ancient-wisdom.co.uk/iraqnippur.htm). Most Mesopotamian cultures were highly self-conscious about what today we'd call 'historical preservation': preserving antiquities, restoring old temples, and researching obscure points of old law or ancient rituals were highly regarded pursuits -- Asshurbanipal himself, whose library we've found, likes to boast about his skill with dead languages like Sumerian (which was only a scholarly language in his day : it's hard to recall that from the fall of the Assyrian empire is closer to us in time than it is to the foundation of Uruk!) 

The distribution of material in the libraries is not exactly what we might be used to. There is relatively little 'literature', that is fiction, poetry, or drama (there's a lot of stuff in poetic form, particularly 'hymns' or religious recitals in verse -- but it's not _personal_  poetry with a few exceptions). 

There are a lot of legal texts - decrees and law codes. Although Mesopotamians didn't do academic history, they were keen antiquarians and went out of their way to recopy old legal and political texts they found important ( we know of the [Code of Hammurabi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi) well because it's preserved in many copies: it was a common homework assignment for young scribes). 

There are a lot of dictionaries, which is great for scholars -- the same writing system (cuneiform tablets) was used for several languages: Sumerian, Akkadian, Aramaic and (much later) Persian as well as a few less famous ones; this means we have a really complete lexicon but many of the things it refers to are lost: we may know the Sumerian, Babylonian and Assyran names for a certain plant without being sure what plant is actually meant (unless it shows up in some other context, like a medical text, where we can figure it out). [Cuneiform word lists](http://cuneiform.org/words.htm).

There is a lot of religious material, including a mix of hymns, prayers, and rituals. Unfortunately for us the material is usually from the practical or poetic side of the religious spectrum, rather than the philosophical side -- we see lots of details of worship but not as much of the philosophical outlook behind the rituals; we have stories and myths but not as much of the interpretations that were placed on them. [Ancient Mesopotamian religion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Mesopotamian_religion)

There is no history, in our sense of retrospective analysis of past times. There are political records -- so and so reigned for X years in city Y -- and a lot of political propaganda:



> “

> I felled 50 of their fighting men with the sword, burnt 200 captives from them, [and] defeated in a battle on the plain 332 troops. … With their blood I dyed the mountain red like red wool, [and] the rest of them the ravines [and] torrents of the mountain swallowed. I carried off captives [and] possessions from them. I cut off the heads of their

> fighters [and] built [therewith] a tower before their city. I burnt their adolescent boys [and] girls.”

> ’” 



is a pretty mellow example. However you don't see arguments about _why_  something happened, or arguments about conflicting source material. There are, though, some priceless diplomatic records: letters exchanged between kings which give us a good insight into the diplomacy, trade, and cultural exchanges of the age and are great for our scholars: for example, the [Ugarit letters](http://sophrosune.blogspot.com/2008/06/last-days-of-ugarit.html) (which are not strictly 'Mesopotamian': they come from western Syria, but they are part of the near-eastern diplomatic scene).

There's not much philosophy in the sense of arguments about how things ought to work or theories about the meaning of life. There are, however, a lot of collections of proverbs, maxims and stories with morals intended to teach life lessons:



> "Give me!" is what the king says.
"Though I still have bread left over, I will eat your bread!" Will this endear a man to the household of his friend?
He who knows how to move around . . . will live longer than the sedentary man.
When a man comes forward as a witness, saying: "Let me tell you what I know about him", but does not know the relevant information, it is an abomination.
When righteousness is cut off, injustice is increased.


Many of the stories have a similar feel to the biblical Proverbs or Psalms. [Babylonian Proverbs and Precepts- Ashurbanipal's Library](http://www.utexas.edu/courses/classicalarch/readings/BabProvAshur.html). These also provide interesting windows into ancient social life.

There are a lot of medical texts, an interesting mixture of very practical and empirical stuff with a lot of magical incantations, prayers, and rituals. _Not unlike the internet!_ There is not much speculative science -- no 'earth, air, fire, and water' but some practical observations, including some high quality astronomical observations. There is also a lot of practical math - multiplication tables, methods for doing square roots, and so on. The Babylonians, in particular, were math and astronomy whizzes despite not having decimal arithmetic.

The gem of the collections are the stories, most famously the [Epic of Gilgamesh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh) -- the oldest work of long-form written fiction in the world. As I said above, 'fiction' is rare but important stories with a religious or cultural epic message did get written down; this gives us great insights into the mythical and legendary background of Mesopotamian culture, although, as always, its hard to know exactly how much we can rely on the literary evidence. There are some really suggestive bits: Gilgamesh seems to be lobbying a bi-cameral city legislature in [Gilgamesh and Aga](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1811.htm). Mythological narratives like the [Enuma Elish](http://www.cresourcei.org/enumaelish.html) give some insight into religious and folk beliefs. 

Outside of the libraries proper, we also have a lot of everyday material -- shipping records, tax receipts, business contracts, and the day-to-day management of the temples and royal estates. These were not preserved with the deliberate intention of storing 'important' information as were the library texts, but they are so numerous that they are probably the bulk of what we actually have to read. They aren't exciting but they can be valuable evidence for social historians, economic historians, and students of everyday life.
