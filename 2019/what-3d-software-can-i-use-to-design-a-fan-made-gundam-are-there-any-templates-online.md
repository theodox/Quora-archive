[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is free and very capable. It will take a good bit of work to get up to speed but there’s a lot of good tutorial material online. There are also [a lot of Gundam models out there for free](http://d).

Here’s a somewhat dizzying speed-vid of somebody modeling a Gundam in Blender. You can do like this artist and use hand-drawn reference in the 3d viewport to stay close to your original concept (warning — unnecessarily triumphant soundtrack!)



Having done a fair number of giant mecha models back in the say I can tell you that you’ll run into some fascinating issues when you try to go from 2D to 3D — it’s way, way easier than you’d think to to sketch an mech model that can’t actually walk or pose : the original concept art for this guy, for example, had a pelvis angled in a way that only allowed him to squat but not to walk.

And this one’s knees did not allow his legs to actually bend.

A lot of Japanese mecha designers use motorcycle and automotive parts as inspiration but also as mechanical reference.
