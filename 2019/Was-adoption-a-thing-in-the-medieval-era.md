There are really two different stories, depending on whether you look at adoption as a mechanism for finding homes for children or as a mechanism for finding children.

__Background: the Roman version__ 

In antiquity a family — a noble family, anyway, the kind we read about in our sources — could only retain its influence through inheritance. In Roman times, adoption was a key tool to preserve that influence.

The most famous example, by far, is Gaius Julius Caesar — not the one you’re probably thinking about, but Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus, born Gaius Octavius Thurinus and adopted by the first Caesar. Octavian inherited the dictator’s name — he refused to acknowledge anyone who addressed him by his birth name — and more importantly he inherited the network of relationships and loyalties that came with it; that was how at 20 he was fielding a substantial private army. His was a perfect case of adoption as the transmission of social capital.

Another important motive for adoption, in a society without any social safety net, was elder care. A childless couple could adopt an heir with the provision that their new child — almost always a son — would care for them in their old age before inheriting their property. The mix of motives here was very complex; in late-Roman law it is sometimes hard to distinguish “adoption” in the sense from indentured servitude. And, of course, slavery itself was another mechanism that put poor or orphaned children into other people’s homes.

Finally, Roman law did not recognize corporations. So, adoption was also the key to institutional continuity: the wealthy _nouveau-riche_ ex-slaves who were such stock figures in Roman comedy were usually freedmen adopted by their former masters in order to keep the business of firm within the family.

For all these reasons, adoption was commonplace in Roman law. Far, far more Roman emperors inherited the throne by adoption than through biological parentage. However, because Roman adoption was so heavily oriented toward public, rather than private concerns, it was rather different than the modern version. Infant adoption was less common but the adoption of adults was quite normal — in fact, there are quite a lot of recorded cases of adoptees older than their “parents.” On the other hand the adoption of women or girls was rare, since the Roman version of adoption was about the transmission of social capital and economic power, from which women were mostly excluded.

There was another kind of fostering relationship at the bottom of the social scale, but it is poorly understood. The terms _nutritor_  (“one who rears”) and _alumnus/-a (_ “foster-child”_)_ are common but how they map onto the well known law of Roman adoption is unclear. It’s been suggested that many of these _alumni_  were children whose parents gave them up for one reason or another. Often, the unwanted children of the poor were sold into slavery — this allowed the children to survive and offered some money to the parents. Our word _proletarian_  comes from [a Latin word meaning “those whose only wealth is in their offspring.”](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=proletarius) So it’s possible that many alumni were slave children who became integrated into their owner’s families. It’s also possible that alumni were foundlings, abandoned at birth — though Romans in general had no objection to infanticide and children with serious mental or physical disabilities were rarely allowed to live.

__Into the Middle Ages__ 

In the middle ages the two halves of the picture both changed in different ways.

From the standpoint of potential parents, at-will adoptions on the Roman pattern declined significantly. Germanic tribal custom placed a much heavier emphasis on blood kinship than Roman law had done — in the first century Tacitus had observed with some surprise that Germans of his day had no system of personal testaments and all inheritance was divided by custom alone.

For that reason, high-status adoptions on the old Roman pattern were fairly rare in northern and eastern Europe where influence of Germanic customary law was stronger. When they did happen they were bound up in complex requirements intended to safeguard the interest of the community as a whole (and, presumably, to protect the interest of the clan from “outsiders”). Some communities allowed adoption only to those who had no other hope of having children. The adoptive relation was seen as an “imitation of nature” that was allowed as a consolation to the childless but still inferior to the natural relation of parent and child.

In Mediterranean Europe the old Roman legal traditions persisted. However — probably reflecting the importance of the Germanic stratum of the feudal classes — high-status people made less frequent use of adoption than their Roman-era predecessors, even though the laws were for the most part lineal descendants of the old Roman codes. Most of the adoptions we see in the record are among the bourgeoisie.

The pragmatic element of adoption — combined with the high child mortality rate — meant that infant adoptions were rare. The goal for many adoptive parents was to find someone to care for themselves or their property, not to find an infant to raise as their own (though, of course, there were many cases where relatives would “adopt” a child informally within the family for more personal reasons).

From the perspective of children, the Middle Ages saw several important changes. Most obvious was the fact that the church condemned infanticide — many children who would simply have been killed in the Roman era survived in the medieval period. At the same time the decline of chattel slavery within Europe greatly reduced the “market” for unwanted children — though families could still apprentice a youngster on terms which were not much better.

These two trends together created a population of children in need of care. In most of Europe, it was monasteries and convents which found places for children without guardians. It’s no accident that the modern term for a layperson who assists or supports a monastic community is _oblate_  — in Latin it’s literally “something laid before,” like a foundling laid before the monastery door, a common theme in medieval stories. The monasteries acted in a quasi-parental role, finding craft apprenticeships for the boys and husbands for the girls — although many of the children ended up remaining in the monastic communities instead. Our usage _alumni_  for “former students” reflects the role of monasteries — which were also the main educational institutions of early-Medieval Europe — as foster parents.

__TLDR__ 

Would-be medieval parents wanted someone to care for them in old age, or to preserve a family patrimony; poor parents were often unable or sometimes unwilling to raise their children. However there was no good analogy to the modern adoption agency — the needs of the first group and the second did not align very well.

At the top of the social scale the importance of bloodlines limited both the practice of adoption and the pool of candidates: a noble family might adopt if they had no heirs — but they would never stoop to adopt a child of a lower social class! Pragmatic motivations meant that adoption always remained a possibility for the less exalted — though in some places adoption was only available to persons who could not have children through other means.

For children in need of parents, monasteries were the caregiver of resort, until about the 14th century when new institutions — the first orphanages and foundling hospitals — began to spring up in wealthier areas.
