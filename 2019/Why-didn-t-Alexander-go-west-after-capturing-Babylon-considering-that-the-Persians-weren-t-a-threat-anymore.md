Because — apart from the Babylonian satrapy — that’s where the money was.

Here’s Herodotus’ list of tribute totals from the various Persian Satrapies (granted, this is under Darius I not Darius III, but it’s very illustrative)

> The [Ionians](https://www.livius.org/articles/people/yauna/), the Magnesians in Asia, the Aeolians, [Carians](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/caria/), [Lycians](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/lycia/), Milyans, and [Pamphylians](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/pamphylia/) contributed together a total sum of 400 talents of silver.

> The Mysians, [Lydians](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/lydia/), Lasonians, Cabalians, and Hytennians, 500 talents.

> The people on the southern shore of the [Hellespont](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/hellespont-dardanelles/), the [Phrygians](https://www.livius.org/articles/people/phrygians/), the Thracians of Asia, the [Paphlagonians](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/paphlagonia/), Mariandynians, and Syrians, 360 talents.

> The [Cilicians](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/cilicia/) paid 500 talents of silver, together with 360 white horses (one for each day in the year); of the money, 140 talents were used to maintain the cavalry force which guarded Cilicia, and the remaining 360 went to Darius.

> From the town of Posidium, which was founded by Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraus, on the border between Cilicia and Syria, as far as Egypt - omitting [Arab](https://www.livius.org/articles/people/arabs/) territory, which was free of tax, came 350 talents. This province contains the whole of [Phoenicia](https://www.livius.org/articles/people/phoenicians/) and that part of Syria which is called Palestine, and [Cyprus](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/cyprus/).

With the capture of Babylon, Alexander could be said to be in control of satrapies 1–7 and 9; a total annual tribute of __3840__  talents of silver

The remainder of the empire (satrapies 8 and 10–20) accounted for __3760__ talents of silver — but also for __360 talents of gold__ . The exchange rate is not really known but 12:1 is a pretty common average so that equates to a further __4320 talents.__ The combined total of __8080 talents__  is rather more than twice the revenue for the western half of the empire.

In other words, even with the western provinces in his hands, the rump Persian empire was twice as wealthy as Alexander’s new possessions.

But — even more important — the Persians had been hoarding their tribute for two centuries. The three primary imperial treasuries were at Persepolis, Ecbatana and Susa: all still in Persian hands, and all positively stuffed with gold and silver. Here’s Arrian’s description of the spoils of Persepolis:

> Alexander ascended to the citadel terrace and took possession of the treasure there. This had been accumulated from the state revenues, beginning with Cyrus, the first king of the Persians, down to that time, and the vaults were packed full of silver and gold. The total was found to be __one hundred and twenty thousand talents__ , when the gold was estimated in terms of silver.

The low figure for Susa is a further __40,000 talents.__ Ecbatana had less gold, but it was the primary imperial mint; when Darius fled the field at Gaugamela he left behind the equivalent of __8,000 talents__ he had taken from Ecbatana while preparing his forces — and he had not taken every coin from the vaults by any means.

So, Alexander kept going east because that’s where the money was. If he had not, at the very least, managed to seize the royal treasuries of Ecbatana, Susa and above all Persepolis he would have face new and larger Persian armies again in the future; bitter experience had shown that Persian money mattered more than Greek battlefield prowess over the long haul. He’d have been a fool to worry about small fry like Carthage or Sicily with those rich prizes — and those endless reserves of hostile money and manpower — behind him to the east.
