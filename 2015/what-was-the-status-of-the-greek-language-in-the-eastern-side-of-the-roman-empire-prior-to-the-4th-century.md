[Vikram Kumar](https://www.quora.com/profile/Vikram-Kumar-114) has the main points. The only other wrinkles I'd add:


Latin was was the dominant language in Dalmatia, Illyricum, Pannonia, Moesia and Dacia, which were heavily settled by veterans as part of a deliberate effort to 'Romanize' this strategically vital area. Not all the veterans were Latin-speaking Italians, but Latin was their common language. Justinian, the last emperor who spoke Latin as a native, was born in the northern part of modern Macedonia.

Multilingualism was common. Greek or Latin would be second languages for most urbanites, but most people would also have a native language -- of which there were hundreds ranging from big ones like Syriac or Coptic or Armenian to more obscure ones like Galatian, Thracian or Getic.
