Here’s a not very elegant rendering, re-ordered into English word order

As long as (Ὅσον) you live (ζῇς), shine (φαίνου)

Grieve ( λυποῦ ) ye (σὺ) not (μηδὲν) utterly (ὅλως), for (πρὸς) life (τὸ ζῆν) is ( ἐστὶ) brief (ὀλίγον)

Time ( ὁ χρόνος) demands (ἀπαιτεῖ) an end (τὸ τέλος).

The proper order is here (no accents, though)

If you cut and past the Greek above into a search bar, you can follow the links to [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=za%2Fw&la=greek&can=za%2Fw0#lexicon) — click on the ‘LSJ” link where there is one and the ‘Middle Liddell” if there is not — you should get some idea of the range of meanings. The trickiest bit is probably φαίνου, which literally means ‘be visible’, ‘appear’, or ‘shine’ but can also be used for ‘make obvious’, or ‘make manifest’. τέλος means ‘end’ in the sense of completion but also in the sense of ‘culmination’ or ‘fulfillment’, so it’s not necessarily just a _carpe diem_ sentiment.

Luckily the grammar and tenses are not complex here; ζῇς is a regular second-person verb for ‘to live’, φαίνου and λυποῦ are imperatives, ἐστὶ is just ‘is’ and ἀπαιτεῖ is third person with ὁ χρόνος, Time, as the subject.

Apologies for the way the text here is offsetting the accents creating the appearance of spaces, like πρὸς is one word with 4 characters — I know how to do that on a mac but not on windows. Perhaps [Nick Nicholas](https://www.quora.com/profile/Nick-Nicholas-5) will fix my accents, as is his wont.
