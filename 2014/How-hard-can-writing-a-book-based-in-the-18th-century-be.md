If you're interested in how it is done, you might try reading up on [Patrick O'Brian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_O%27Brian), who is regarded as one of the greatest modern historical novelists. His [Aubreyâ€“Maturin series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey%E2%80%93Maturin_series) begins in 1800 so it's not exactly your period, but it's pretty close. 

As far as his method of writing, it seems mostly to have been obsessive reading of original materials. He was incredibly well read on a variety of topics in 18th and early 19th century life, and the wealth of detail has a lot to do with the success of the books. However I feel the real achievement is the way he assimilated Georgian language and outlooks into his writing -- the primary sources really shine through in a way that no amount of reading modern retrospectives could give you.

I've heard the books summed up as "Jane Austen with cannons! -- to which I say, "Hell yeah!"
