There were a wide variety of languages in the region: the whole region was open to invasion and trade on three sides so there were lots of communities. In later times the Assyrian practice of forced resettlement of conquered nations also contributed to linguistic diversity.

 The main literary language of the Assyrians themselves during the Old Assyrian Empire (roughly 2000 - 1000 BC) was [Akkadian](http://Akkadian). Specialists and priests usually knew some Sumerian but it was only a literary and liturgical language in Assyrian times. The same Akkadian language was shared outside of Assyria proper, notably by the Assyrians' perpetual rivals in Babylon; but over time the usages hardened into distinct though still more or less mutually intelligible dialects, Assyrian and Babylonian -- though the older Akkadian usages were kept alive in official texts as well. Old Babylonian was the more popular dialect outside the two states and widely used for trade and diplomacy in the first part of this period; in the second half of this time Assyrian became more common outside of Assyria proper, particularly in trade.. 

[Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Aramaic_language) spread widely and edged out both Assyrian and Babylonian as the language of trade, particularly after the [Late Bronze Age collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse) in 1200's disrupted the political power of both Assyria and Babylon. the The Neo-Assyrian Empire (911- 609 BC) eventually adopted as a court language and probably spoke it as well -- Aramaic was the most important spoken language throughout the region until well into the Greek period (post 331 BC). However in intensely conservative Mesopotamia all of the previous languages remained in antiquarian use -- the last emperor of Assyria, [Ashurbanipal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashurbanipal), was fond of bragging about his ability to read classical Sumerian and Akkadian texts from two thousand years before his time.

Akkadian and Aramaic are both Semitic languages, but Akkadian was from the (now extinct) [East Semitic f](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Semitic_languages)amily while Aramaic from the Northwest Semitic group (close to modern Hebrew and Phoenician and somewhat akin to modern Arabic). Modern Assyrians in Iraq (and the Assyrian diaspora, particularly in Chicago) speak Neo-Assyrian, which is a dialect of [Syriac ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_language), and thus a grandchild of Aramaic.
