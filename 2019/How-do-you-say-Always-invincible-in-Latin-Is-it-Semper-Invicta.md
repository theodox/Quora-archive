semper invicta when describing something grammatically feminine; semper invictus for something grammatically masculine. -ae and -i for plural nouns.

Grammatical gender is not always predictable based on real-world gender, so youâ€™d need to know the Latin for the thing, person or group who was invincible. Luckily [Latin Dictionary and Grammar Resources](http://www.latin-dictionary.net/) always tells you when you do a look up.
