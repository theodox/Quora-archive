Speaking for the States:

Nowadays, it’s not very well or widely taught in public schools. There are certainly programs in various places; American secondary education is very diverse, there’s no real national curriculum. However it’s definitely not fashionable or regarded as essential. Latin is a lot more common in the northeast, where there is a stronger cultural attachment to Europe in general and — probably not coincidentally — more people of Italian descent. However even there, would have spend some time looking before you could find an educated adult who could pick up a page of Caesar and read it at sight. It’s also very unlikely that an American high school student will ever have read a Latin work in translation.

Until fairly recently, a lot of people had “second-hand” Latin, acquired by familiarity with Latinate words in English and with older English literature where some level of Latin vocabulary was assumed. However the modern effort to dethrone European culture from pride of place in American education has generally destroyed that level of cultural connection too. Nowadays, strong familiarity with Latin vocabulary is more likely to be seen as pedantry than as evidence of a solid education. So — except among very particular audiences — a well chosen Latin tagline or a particularly elegant choice of Latinate English word won’t won’t score you a lot of points. The only exception these days is the law, where a smattering of legal Latin still attracts lawyers of a more nostalgic style. But even there, _res ipsa loquitur_  or _mens rea_ are likely to earn as many blank stares as nods of agreement.

In colleges and universities Latin is still taught, though usually in small and diminishing faculties. You can certainly get an introduction to Latin if you want, but in contemporary America it’s a subject for personal curiosity — certainly not a recognized marker of educational status.

Latin retains a lingering aura of prestige — it’s an impressive addition to a college diploma, a source of possible names for various startups, and (God knows!) the inspiration for a lot of tattoos. However this is really a kind of fossilized remnant of a very different world, one that doesn’t have a lot of traction in many sectors of American society. Certainly where I live on the west coast it would be far, far easier to find somebody to debate the relative merits of Theraveda and Mahayana Buddhism than those of Horace and Catullus.
