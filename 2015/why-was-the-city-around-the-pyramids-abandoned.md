The complexes near the pyramids were not 'cities': they were [necropoleis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necropolis) (that's the fancy plural of 'necropolis' : the 'cities of the dead').
 
The pyramid complexes weren't inhabited by civilian populations who lived and work their for reasons of their own. They were temple complexes -- temples for the funerary priests who who offered sacrifices and performed rituals for the dead pharoahs. They had staffs to do maintenance work, take care of their daily needs, and guard the tombs -- tomb robbery was a constant worry, since the treasures of the pharoahs were legendary.

The funeral establishments were very expensive to maintain; eventually a civil war, a foreign occupation, or an economic disruption would interrupt the flow of funds. When that happened the priests and their staffs would drift away (these periods were also, of course, great times for the tomb robbers). Although Egpytian history seems very homogeneous to us, it had plenty of periods of unheaval : there were 31 different dynasties, usually separated by periods of civil war or foreign conquest, over three millenia or so.

We've also recently uncovered the remains of some of the work camps where the laborers who built the pyramids lived while construction was going on. These were pretty substantial - a pyramid could require tens of thousands of workers. These sites included not just houses but also bakeries, breweries, and other necessities of life. However these were temporary by design: they were simply abandoned when construction was done, like the labor camps around a big 1930's dam project.
