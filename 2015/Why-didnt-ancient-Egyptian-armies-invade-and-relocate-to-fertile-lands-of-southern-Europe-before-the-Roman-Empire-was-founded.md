As the other answers noted, Egypt was far more agriculturally productive than any other part of the ancient world: Egypt was the breadbasket of the Roman empire and the primary source of food that kept the city of Rome fed. Leaving the fertile Nile Valley for Italy (which was mountainous and in those pre-Roman-aqueduct days not universally well watered) would have been a step down.

There were other very practical impediments to Egyptian conquest. The main one is that during the heyday of the native Egyptian dynasties, nobody (particularly not the Egyptians, who were not great open-water sailors) could mount a significant naval invasion. The peak of native Egyptian power is probably the reign of [Ramesses II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II) (ca 1279-1213 BC). He pushed Egyptian armies as far north as Qadesh (in Syria) and far south into Nubia. establishing a primacy over the other great powers of the day (the [Hittites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittites) and the [Mitanni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitanni))

However Egypt's navy was not powerful or far-ranging: the Egyptians were used to the very predictable experience of sailing the Nile. Egyptians in this period tended to leave the blue-water sailing to the Cypriots. Only 50 years later, at the [Battle of the Delta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Delta), [Ramesses III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_III) - even fighting in home waters -- barely managed to save Egypt from the [Sea Peoples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples) -- a collection of invaders (origins and homelands debated) who tried a seaborne invasion. However the "Sea Peoples" didn't ship over sea like a Bronze age D-Day: they coasted down along the coast from Lebanon alongside a land-based migrations.

This also is part of the other reason : the [Late Bronze Age collapse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse) crippled Egypt (and Hatti, and the Mitanni) and ushered in a long period of poverty and chaos. By the time the dust settled, new powers -- the [Neo-Assyrians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire), the Greeks, the Phoenicians and the other familiar names from Greek and Roman history -- had arisen and Egpyt was a declining power.

In any case, large scale amphibious invasions really didn't come along until much later. Greek and Phoenician colonies did spring up all over the Mediterranean after the 8th century BC, but they were small affairs to begin with. The Greek colony at [Cyrene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrene,_Libya), for example, started with only two shiploads, probably less than 250 colonists.
