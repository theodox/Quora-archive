Short answer — there are a lot of theories but no solid consensus. Of the many, many identifications people have proposed based on the Egyptian sources the strongest one is probably the connections of the [Sherden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherden) with the Nuraghic culture of Sardinia, but even that one is still debatable (number two is probably the [Lukka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lukka_lands) being the historic Lycians). The [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples) gives a list of some of the common guesses, but it’s worth emphasizing that they are all mostly just that - guesses.
