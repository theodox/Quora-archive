# Why didn’t Roman Emperors generally produce as many children as the monarchs of other countries? Why is it that practically nobody can claim descent from a Roman Emperor?

The Romans never really embraced hereditary succession; [only a handful of emperors passed the throne to their children](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires).

The [majority of emperors were either self proclaimed coup leaders](https://www.quora.com/How-were-Roman-Emperors-chosen) or, in more settled times, adult colleagues of the existing emperor who were brought on to ensure a smooth succession.

Dynastic loyalty was not as powerful in the Roman psyche as it would be in, say, the European Middle Ages — a boy who inherited the throne at 13 would be unlikely to reach adulthood unless he was very lucky; there was little chance that an outraged populace would rise up to defend the “legitimate heir” when so few families held the throne long enough to become fixtures in the popular imagination.

Towards the end of the Roman period the dynastic principle did get stronger. The last emperor of the west, [Honorius ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorius_(emperor))and his equally useless brother [Arcadius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadius) managed to survive to adulthood — though the very dubious character of both reigns is a good argument on behalf of the superiority of the old system of military coups and assassinations. The Romans also did not do a good job of grooming potential emperors from youth; the (relatively) well behaved royals of modern Europe look pretty tame compared to heirs-apparent like [Commodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus) and [Caracalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla), both of whom were serious steps down compared to their very competent fathers.
