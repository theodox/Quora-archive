# What would happen if Trajan permitted women to enlist in the Roman legion? Would it make a difference at all?

It’s hard to envision a scenario where this makes any sense to your average Roman emperor.

Even assuming there were no social objections — which is an enormous assumption — the legions were not short of, er, _personpower_ . The empire was home to something in the ballpark of sixty million people in Trajan’s day. Even conservatively the military age population of both sexes would probably be something like fifteen million individuals.

There were were about 150,000 legionaries and 200,000 auxilia in Trajan’s armies, so there were somewhere between 40 and 45 eligible people for every soldier’s berth. That strongly suggests that it was not demographics but money which limited the size of the empire’s armies. By way of comparison, the Confederacy fielded an army of around a million from a population of only 9 million; they _were_  desperate for soldiers, so desperate that by 1865 they were considering drafting slaves into the army fighting to preserve slavery.

The Romans, at least in Trajan’s day, could afford to be much pickier.

There are not really any jobs on a second century battlefield where muscle mass, reach, and upper body strength don’t matter. In a world without firearms there’s not much that you can do to equalize that: even ballistae and bows are ultimately powered by human muscle. Maybe light cavalry scouting might make sense (women do have two important advantages when it comes to bumping along on horseback at speed: weight and, er, comfort issues). But in general, bigger is better on a muscle-powered battlefield. The primary weapon of the legions was the [pilum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilum), a heavy javelin. The modern men’s record for a javelin throw is about 100 meters with an 800 gram javelin: the women’s record is 72 meters with a 600 gram javelin.

The Romans knew this, of course: the minimum height requirement for a legionary recruit was 5′10″ in Roman feet, or 172 cm — a height which would exclude the average Roman man at least from Pompeii or Herculaneum (166 and 162 cm, respectively). Roman women were notably smaller (156/155): only about 1% of them would have met the minimum height requirement.*

_[Female gladiators was, in fact, a thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiatrix)_ _— but primarily as a novelty act_ 

Absent a desperate need for live bodies, the only reason for a cash-conscious Roman emperor to enroll female legionaries would have to be an overwhelming ideological commitment — or, I guess, a massive campaign of civil disobedience on the part of Roman men.

If you’re looking for an alternate-history justification, you probably need to accelerate the development of gunpowder: then you might be able to create a Roman version of the [Dahomey Amazons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahomey_Amazons). You might perhaps try to push the scenario later, into the fifth century when the Empire was strapped for money and also significantly depopulated. In our world this led to increasing reliance on _foederati_ , non-Roman “allies” who often turned out to be less than trustworthy. Perhaps in some alternate universe a more patriotic Late Rome could stem the barbarian tides with universal conscription.**

All that said, the Roman military is less monotonically male than you might expect. No military, after all, exists entirely on the battlefield. The legions usually traveled with a large cloud of civilian camp followers, male and female, who provided everything from food and clothing to personal services for the soldiers. *** The _[lixae](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:entry=lixae-cn)_ _—_ it’s probably significant that the word is feminine in gender — did many of the jobs that a modern army hands to its logistics echelon. It doesn’t matter if Publius and Gaius are deadly with the pilum if they are malnourished or freezing in threadbare clothes: a successful army depends on its supply train. In antiquity, that supply train had a substantial female component.

The _lixae_  even contributed to [at least one Roman victory,](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Liv.%2023.16&lang=original) at Nola in the war against Hannibal. The camp women and baggage-handlers fooled the Carthaginians with a loud clamor and demonstration that looks like a surprise attack, panicking Hannibal’s troops and precipitating a rout.



*Assuming I’m using the calculator on [this page](https://tall.life/height-percentile-calculator-age-country/) right.
**In our world, large portions of the population were tied to the land as more-or-less serfs, and thus ineligible for the army (and also, too politically apathetic to rise up in defense of the Roman order). But in a more equitable Rome…?
