Probably, although we don’t have any direct evidence for it.

Magna Graecia had been in contact with the Romans for a good while by Alexander’s day — around the end of Alexander’s life the Romans had already acquired Capua and Cumae, for example. The trade relationship between Greeks and Romans antedates the republic itself. So if Alexander had any interest in Italy the information was available for a little bit in inquiry.

However the subject was not of deep interest to 4th century BC Greeks, there are very[ few surviving literary sources f](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-ancient-Hellenic-references-to-the-Roman-Republic-before-the-Punic-Wars/answer/Steve-Theodore)rom before the 2d century. Alexander’s contemporary, [Hieronymus of Cardia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_of_Cardia), did write a little bit (now lost) about Rome. Hieronymus, however, lived to be 104, so he outlived Alexander by a good long while ; but he did live to chronicle the Italian campaign of Pyrrhus, which culminated in the [Battle of Asculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Asculum) in 279, two generations after Alexander’s death and the first recorded clash between Greeks and Romans.

It’s sometimes claimed (on no particular evidence) that the travels of [Pytheas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pytheas) around western Europe were some kind of advance scouting for Alexander — if that’s true (I doubt it, myself) it’s probably worth noting that he didn’t bother discussing Italy, even though his home city of Massillia (Marseilles) traded with the Romans and shared contact with the Gauls of northern Italy.
