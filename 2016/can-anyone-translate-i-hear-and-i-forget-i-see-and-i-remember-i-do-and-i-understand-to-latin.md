_audiens obliviscor, spectans recordor, faciens scio_ 

‘hearing I forget, observing I recall, doing I know’ .

I though perhaps an ablative absolute like

_audito mihi, obliviscor; spectato mihi, recordor; facto mihi, scio_ 

but on looking it up apparently it’s not supposed to be used with pronouns…
