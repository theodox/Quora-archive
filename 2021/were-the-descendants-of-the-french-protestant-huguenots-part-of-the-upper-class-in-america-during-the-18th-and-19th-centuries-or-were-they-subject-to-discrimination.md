In colonial America., the Huguenots were regarded as fellow-Protestant heroes who defied the absolutism and Catholicism of the French monarchy. They received fairly favorable treatment from English authorities — most famously, the grant of land that [eventually became the city of New Rochelle, New York, ](https://www.newyorkalmanack.com/2021/10/huguenots-new-rochelles-spirit-of-liberty/)from [John Pell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Pell), the “feudal lord” of Pelham Manor in lower Westchester.

There were several Huguenot settlements up and down the eastern seaboard and they generally all prospered: the Huguenot immigrants tended to be wealthy and well educated. New Rochelle, for example, housed a popular boarding school where English-speaking families in lower New York would send their children to learn French.

You can get a sense of how well the Huguenots did in America by considering some of their descendants:

Paul Revere was the grandson of Huguenot Apollo Rivoire

George Washington had a Huguenot maternal grandfather

John Jay, hos grandfather was a Huguenot emigre to South Carolina

[E. I. du Pont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89leuth%C3%A8re_Ir%C3%A9n%C3%A9e_du_Pont), founder of one of America’s richest families (though he emigrated much later than the original Huguenot settlers).

Presidents Grant, Taft, Ford, Truman, Johnson and both Roosevelts.

The [wikipedia list of people of Hugenot descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Huguenots) is naturally biased towards the wealthy and famous — but it’s long enough to illustrate that Huguenot ancestry was not a disability in 18th or 19th century America.
