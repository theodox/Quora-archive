This is a bit of a fun one, with a slightly twisty etymology:

Here’s a great example of what a Roman would call a _[fornix](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Fornix.html)_ .

In ordinary Latin _fornix_  is an arch, or more correctly a barrel vault. This does not, however, imply that “fornication” involves a triumphal procession.

The arch and the barrel vault are the key Roman load-bearing structures. Unlike Greeks — who tended to rely on columns and lintels — the Romans used arches whenever they could as a way of getting more strength out of humble materials like brick and concrete. So, the first floor or a sub-floor below street level of many Roman buildings would be a vault like this, from the [Insula dell'Ara Coeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_dell%27Ara_Coeli) in Rome.

Since the darker, poorly ventilated interior spaces were not very popular as retail locations, they found other uses where daylight was not a welcome commodity. By at least the first century _fornix_ had become slang for a brothel: For example, in Horace’s Satires, 1.2:

> nil medium est. sunt qui nolint tetigisse nisi illas
quarum subsuta talos tegat instita veste,
contra alius nullam nisi olenti __in fornice__  stantem.

> There’s no happy medium. Some will only touch women
Whose ankles are hidden beneath a wife’s flounces:
Another only those who frequent stinking brothels.

And Juvenal 11:

> …. Let the man
Enjoy the clacking castanets; words from which even
The naked slave, for sale in a rank brothel, will abstain;
Let him delight in filthy language and pornographic art;

> audiat ille
testarum crepitus cum uerbis, nudum olido stans
__fornice__ mancipium quibus abstinet
uocibus obscenis omnique libidinis arte,

There’s some debate among etymologists about the precise origin of the term — sometimes you’ll find it suggested that the term originated from streetwalkers plying their trade under (for example) the arches of an aqueduct. It’s not impossible, but there’s no direct evidence for that and there _is_ plenty of evidence for brothels being pretty dank: you’ll note that both examples above have an emphasis on… er… odor.

So: _that’s_ where we get _fornication_ . It’s visiting a _fornix —_ which, for reasons that should be obvious, the New Testament says is something you’re not supposed to do. In the original Greek it’s the more straightforward πορνεία (porneia), “prostitution” (which shares the same the same root as “pornography”). The Latin Vulgate translated it as _fornicatio,_ and until recently English translators have historically tended to stick with the less graphic and more obscure Latin term.

Oddly, _fornix_  in Latin was always perfectly acceptable for “arch” or “vaulted passageway” in other contexts — in military terminology, for example, it’s a sally-port, a small easily defended gateway in a city wall from which defenders could issue out for raids against a besieging army. Unless that’s some kind of a pun that’s lost on us it’s just an accident of usage that probably conjured up a few sniggers in antiquity — think of trying to explain to a ten year old why you’re looking for a “pork butt” at the supermarket. There are quite a few [medical uses of the term ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornix_(neuroanatomy))which rely on the purely architectural meaning.
