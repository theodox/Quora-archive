Not really; although Carthage was somewhat exotic in the eyes of a fourth century Athenian it was definitely a well known place. [Aristotle knew some details of the Carthaginian constitution](https://www.ancient.eu/amp/2-193/), for example which he thought was very orderly. And Plato was at one point a houseguest of the tyrant of Syracuse in Sicily, who alternately fought and traded with the Carthaginians all the time.

[The vanished city of Tartessos ](https://www.ancient.eu/amp/1-311/)is often cited as a candidate for the real Atlantisâ€” it had disappeared some time before the fifth century BC but its wealth remained legendary in the Greek world.
