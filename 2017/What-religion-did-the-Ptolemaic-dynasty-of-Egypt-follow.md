They didn’t really “follow” one: they led two or three depending on how you want to count, and patronized another.

The most visible identity came from their support for the traditional Egyptian religion. Following Alexander the Great’s lead they occupied something like the traditional position of Egyptian pharaohs: they wanted their Egyptian subjects, at least, to think of them as god-kings in the classical Pharaonic mode. They funded Egyptian temples and they respected the rights of the Egyptian religious hierarchy. In art and architecture designed for Egyptian consumption, they appeared like this:

But the native Egyptians were not the only constituency the Ptolemies considered. While they always took pains to try to appear properly Pharaonic to their Egyptian subjects they didn’t want to risk their credentials as sophisticated Hellenes. In Alexandria in particular, and in all of the larger cities of Egypt where they planted Greek colonies, they sponsored traditional Greek religious practices; the Greek religious festivals, athletic games, and processions of Alexandria were [famous for their magnificence](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/285ptolemyII.asp). The Ptolemies also made very public donations to traditional Greek shrines at Delphi and Delos.

So, the Ptolemies had at least two distinct religious identities: one as the focus of the traditional Egyptian religion and another as Hellenes. They also tried to find ways to fuse those two halves into a whole. In some ways this was easy, since Greeks usually found ways to find (or to pretend they had found) common identities between the traditional Olympian deities and other people’s gods. This is obvious as early as Herodotus, two centuries before Ptolemy I, but the Ptolemies tried particularly hard to foster syncretic cults that would unite their Greek and Egyptian subjects. The most famous is the cult of [Serapis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapis), who drew from elements of Dionsysus and Osiris.

_Serapis combined Greek visual style with traditional Egyptian themes of personal immortality - a way of harmonizing the two cultures of Egypt._ 

The Ptolemies also attached a huge amount of public importance to Alexander the Great’s divinity. The native population of Egypt was attached to Alexander’s memory: whether Alexander and his military companions [took his claim to be the son of Zeus-Amun seriously](https://www.quora.com/To-which-religion-did-Alexander-the-Great-belong/answer/Steve-Theodore), it was a political masterstroke that earned him a great deal of affection from the Egyptians. Among Greeks, Alexander’s prestige was enormous. So, the Ptolemies tried to wrap themselves in his reflected glory. Ptolemy I basically kidnapped Alexander’s mortal remains when they were on their way back from Babylon to Macedonia. Possession of Alexander’s tomb was a huge propaganda coup for Ptolemy. The royal family were the chief priests of the worship of Alexander. They also received at least nominal worship themselves as _theoi synnaoi,_ “temple sharing gods” with Alexander.

Finally they Ptolemies had an on-again, off-again relationship with Judaism. Egypt already had had a Jewish population under the Persians. During the heyday of Ptolemaic political power in the Levant the Ptolemies fought the Jewish state, and many of the Jews who first came to Egypt in their time came as captives. However when Judea was under the control of the rival Seleucid empire the Ptolemies were much more solicitous; they sponsored the translation of the Jewish Bible into Greek and briefly hosted a [rival temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Onias) which competed for the loyalty of Jews. Later in the Ptolemaic period relations turned sour, setting the stage for the dreary history of antisemitism which marked Roman Egypt, but for much of the Ptolemaic period Jews were a favored minority.
