I have to say this sounds and _awful lot_  like homework, especially since Herodotus certainly didn’t title his own work “The Essential Herodotus.”

I will however give you a couple of useful places to look for the answer:

__Time.__ You can learn a good bit about how Herodotus thought about time and change in book 2, particularly in the [first few chapters](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D2&force=y) and in [Chapters 142 - 144](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.142&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126)

__Change__  Herodotus usually puts his analysis into the mouths of his characters. You can see much of how he thinks about the evolution of Persia in the [debate between the Persian nobles in 3.80](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D80) and again in the [speech of Artembares at 9.122 ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D122%3Asection%3D2)which ends the whole book. His overall view of change can also be seen in the debate between Solon and Croesus in [1.30–34](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.30&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126) and between [Croesus and Cyrus from 1.84 to 1.91](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D84)

That’s enough for a good start.
