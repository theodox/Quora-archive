Everything in antiquity is more hyper-local than a Portland organic eatery: many of Rome's legendary adversaries so close that they are now lost under the urban area of the modern city of Rome -- Veii, for instance, is less than 10 miles from the center of Rome; Tarquinii is far off at abot 60 miles. So trying to cover the topic too closely would be very dense. It's also pretty hard to escape the Roman bias in covering this area because the only surviving sources are Latin or Greek : the other languages of Italy survive only in small fragmentary inscriptions or quotations in Latin sources.

The big regional groupings before the Romans swallowed up all of Italy look like this:

It was a fairly diverse patchwork of different peoples. Most of them spoke Osco-Umbrian languages, similar to but distinct from Latin. Generally they had similar social arrangements to the Romans: city states, usually organized as aristocratic republics with strong clans or _gentes_  forming the ruling elite.

The Romans dealt with all of them through a mixture of coercion and diplomacy. Defeated cities were usually forced to become _[socii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socii)_  or "allies" -- essentially surrendering control of their foreign policy and providing military contingents to Rome but otherwise running their own affairs. The Romans planted colonies of Roman citizens (and sometimes of Latins -- the Roman's closest partners) to keep an eye on their new socii. Although this was humiliating it was not ungenerous by ancient standards -- and it gradually freed much of Italy from the the perpetual petty wars that plagued Greece.

As Rome came to absorb the peninsula, many of the leading families in allied towns became Roman citizens -- quite a few famous 'Romans' come from other areas: Pompey the Great from Picenum, Gaius Marius from Arpinum, Maecanas from Arretium, and so on. However ordinary citizens of the allied towns didn't become full-fledged Romans and eventually, in 90 BC almost all of the Italic peoples united against Rome in a final struggle to demand either equal citizenship or independence -- a campaign known as the [Social War. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_War_(90%E2%80%9388_BC))Even though the Romans won that war they had to concede the Italian demands, more-or-less granting full citizenship to the whole of Italy.

Here's a few of the major groups:

__Etruscans__ 

Most Italian tribes spoke one of several [Osco-Umbrian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osco-Umbrian_languages) which are similar to Latin. The Etruscan language in the north-western half of the peninsula is a mystery; it's [sometimes thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_origins)  that Etruscans are descendants of settlers from western Asia Minor -- which might make the legend of Aeneas's escape from Troy into something like a historical fact.

_This Etruscan tomb painting is thought to depict scene from the Trojan War. It could be a sign of Greek cultural influence - or of a long-lost connection between the Etruscans and the historic Troy_ 

According to legend the last three of Rome's kings were Etruscans (from about 616 BC to 509 BC). Etruscan art and particularly Etruscan religion had a big impact on Roman culture -- the "Roman" arts of augury (predicting the future by observing the flight of birds or the entrails of a sacrificed animal) originated with the Etruscans and even very late Roman sooth-sayers and fortune tellers used pseudo-Etruscan jargon for their magical incantations. The Latin alphabet is also derived from the Etruscans (who in turn picked it up from Greek cities in southern Italy).

__Greeks__ 

Starting around the 8th century BC several Greek city-states were founded in southern Italy, scattered around the 'heel' and 'toe' of the Italian boot. The most important ones were [Taras, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taranto)an important port; [Rhegium](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/notes/rhegium.html), which controlled the passage between Sicily and the mainland, and [Neapolis -- ](http://www.napoliunplugged.com/history-of-naples-part-2.html)modern Naples. Together with Sicily these cities formed Μεγάλη Ἑλλάς or "Greater Greece." In classical Greek fashion, however, they squabbled and competed endlessly with each other, never forming any long-lasting political alliance and remaining perpetually exposed to their inland neighbors (the Brutii) and pirates. The very powerful Greek kingdom of Syracuse was a factor to be reckoned with but it was frequently pre-occupied in fighting the Carthaginians (and also the Athenians, whose ill-fated [Sicilian Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Expedition) was directly responsible for the fall of the Athenian democracy).

__Sabines and Samnites__ 

[The Sabines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabines) were closely related to the Romans; in fact early Rome was largely peopled by Sabines and the legendary [abduction of the Sabine women ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rape_of_the_Sabine_Women)was one of Rome's key foundation myths; many important Roman clans were of Sabine origin. In the very early pre-history of Rome Sabines were also among the cities most important enemies.

The Sabines gradually lost importantance during the first two centuries of the Republic. An offshoot of this people, though, who came to be known as the [Samnites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samnites) occupied the hill country of the central part of Italy. They were famous warriors and perhaps the Romans' most persistent adversaries. They fought the Romans in at least 5 major conflicts from the 4th to the 2d century BC, three times on their own and also in alliance with Hannibal. In 321 a Samnite victory at the [ Caudine Forks](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy09.html) sent an entire Roman army 'under the yoke' in a humilating ritual of surrender.

 The Samnites also formed the core of the Anti-Roman forces in the Social War.

__Campanians__ 

The Campanians were a mixed people of both Samnite and Greek origin, settled in south western Italy around Cumae. Like the Samnites they were never very friendly with the Romans and they allied with Hannibal during the Punic invasion. Unlike the inland Samnites, however, the Campanians had a reputation for luxurious living which the Romans affected to despise (although their territory was a favorite site for the luxurious villas or Roman aristocrats in later ages).

__Bruttians__ 

The [Bruttii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruttii) occupied the 'toe' of the boot of Italy. They were frequently in conflict with their Greek neighbors. They seem to have originated as a mixed group of outcasts (the name supposedly means 'deserters'). It's perhaps not an accident that Spartacus based his army of escaped slaves in this area -- or that he was joined by many of the locals.

__Umbrians__ 

[The Umbri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbri) lived up the east coast of the peninsula. Although they spoke an Italic language, ancient tradition believed them to be related to the Gauls. They were generally reliable Roman _socii_  after their conquest in the 4th century -- eventually they came to provide many Roman legionaries in the late Republic. 

__Gauls__ 

The Gauls were relative latecomers to Italy, arriving in the early fourth century BC. They conquered several earlier groups -- the Ligures and the Veneti -- who seem to have been distantly related to them in language and culture but the newcomers were more aggressive and warlike; they established themselves quickly and sacked Rome itself in 390. They were heavily subdivided into dozens of tribal groups which only rarely worked together. In the [Third Samnite War (298-290 BC) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samnite_Wars)they joined with the Samnites and Etruscans in a grand alliance against Roman hegemony, but were defeated. Several Gallic tribes allied with Hannibal, and the region was briefly independent again until 192. Unlike the rest of Italy the Gaulish areas - _Gallia Cisalpina_  - did not become Roman citizens after the Social War.
