Nope. There were three emperors named Darius (_Dārayavauš_ “he who holds firm the good”), and four named Artaxerxes (_Artaxšaçā,_ “just king”).

In all these cases these are official names that the king took when he ascended the throne. In the list above, for example, Darius IIII was born _Artašiyāta_ and took Darius when he unexpectedly found himself king. His predecessor is listed here as Arses but he ruled as “Artaxerxes” (so, he was our Artaxerxes IV — but the Persian’s didn’t use regnal numbers).

Darius I is often also known as “Darius the Great” to distinguish him from his less successful inheritors.
