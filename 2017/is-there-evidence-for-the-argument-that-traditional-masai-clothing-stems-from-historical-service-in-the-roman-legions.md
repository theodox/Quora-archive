# Is there evidence for the argument that traditional Masai clothing stems from historical service in the Roman legions?

I’d doubt it quite strongly.

There are two stories I’ve seen floating around about this idea.

The first is a “lost legion” story. But that’s a tough sell: Roman rule never extended much beyond the modern border between Egypt and Sudan, so about 2,000 kilometers from what the Masai say is their traditional homeland ([Lake Turkana)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Turkana#Anthropology) . The farthest south a Roman army ever got was [Napata,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napata) during a war with [Meroe](http://www.ancient.eu/Meroe/) in 23 BC, but that’s still 1,700 km, and there’s no record of that force losing a substantial amount of people. That war was settled pretty quickly and after that Meroe was generally a Roman ally, so unlikely to have been a good transit route for large numbers of deserters. In later years the kingdom of [Axum ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axum)played a similar role in the same region, so again this is unlikely.

A different variant is soldiers who serve abroad and returned. However there’s [no evidence for large-scale recruitment across the southern Roman border](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Roman-Empire-recruit-have-black-soldiers-if-so-how-many-did-it-have). It’s not impossible that some individuals from Africa served in Roman forces, but the usual Roman pattern was to recruit units from client kingdoms or from among their subjects. This lets us identify roughly where they came from; none of the surviving unit names indicates an origin from the upper Nile or sub-Saharan Africa.

There is some evidence for small-scale contact between Rome and the upper Nile or maybe even Kenya. For example this [mosaic from Roman Edessa ](https://theodox.quora.com/Zebra-Crossing)is probably a [Grévy's zebra ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A9vy's_zebra)from southern Ethiopia, but it could be the Plains variety, which does live in Kenya:

There are other examples of Roman art that imply Romans had met people who look a lot like modern Kenyans and had some trade goods like elephant ivory. However these items were definitely exotica — the Roman view of the world tended to fade out pretty fast south of the Horn of Africa.

The visual similarity between Masai javelins and Roman _pila_ , and the pattern of their swords and sandals, all are pretty striking. But I’d bet it’s just coincidence. And lots of folks wear red.
