Here’s a great example of where Coptic script comes from:

_Year 5 of pharaoh Hyrgonaphor loved by Isis and Osiris, loved by Amon–Re king of the gods, the great god_

This _looks_  like Greek, but if you try to read it as Greek it’s gibberish. It’s a graffito from Abydos, written during the [Great Egyptian Revolt](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/files/TheGreatRevoltoftheEgyptians.pdf) against the Ptolemies. In this case it dates exactly to 189 or 188 BC, since the second line L E πορω υγροναφορ is “in year 5 of pharaoh Hygronaphor”. “[Hugronaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugronaphor)”, is “Herwennefer”, the Nubian rebel-pharaoh who controlled a good chunk of upper Egypt during the revolt. The rest of the text is clearly using Greek letters (without any of the later Coptic glyphs) to write an Egyptian message. The use of vowels is somewhat spotty, perhaps because the glyphs which would later be invented for sounds that Greek didn’t have was still in the future. (L Ε, incidentally, isn’t Εgyptian — the L is a mark used on coins as shorthand for ‘in the year of ‘, and the E is the Greek letter Epsilon used for the number 5. Clearly the writer is familiar with Greek bureaucratic practice).

This is about 150 years after Alexander’s conquest of Egypt, and it shows that at least some Egyptians were clearly literate in Greek. The lower reaches of the bureaucracy were open to Egyptians, who will have known Greek for business reasons; that class (which probably overlaps with the traditional scribal class) is where the use of Greek characters to write Egyptian originates. The modern Coptic alphabet looks more like the scribal practice of a three or four centuries later, but it’s clear that the process of adapting Greek characters to Egyptian use goes back at least to the second century of Greek occupation.
