By far the most intimate look at an individual human in this time period is __the__ __[Confessions](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3296/3296-h/3296-h.htm)__ __of Aurelius Augustinus__ , better known as [St. Augustine](https://thegreatthinkers.org/augustine/biography/).

The book is nominally a prayer (there’s a lot of _thee’s_ and _thou’s_ ) , but it’s fundamentally a look back at the first four decades of his life, detailing his youth in Roman Tunisia, his education in Italy, his ideological wanderings and his eventual conversion to Christianity. In between the theological meditations it is the most complete account of an individual life in late Antiquity: for centuries the book has been regarded as “the first autobiography in European literature.”

If you don’t have a good background in ancient history, Peter Brown’s [Augustine of Hippo](https://books.google.com/books/about/Augustine_of_Hippo.html?id=bJPY1dAZg8cC) is a modern biography which uses the _Confessions_  and a lot of other source material to draw a very nuanced biographical picture of Augustine the individual. It’s a great way to get around the thee’s, thou’s and references to Neoplatonist philosophers.

The __[Life of Constantine](http://eclass.uth.gr/eclass/modules/document/file.php/SEAD260/%CE%95%CF%85%CF%83%CE%AD%CE%B2%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%82,%20Life%20of%20Constantine%20%28trans.%20Averil%20Cameron%20-%20Stuart%20Hall%29.pdf)__ , written by Eusebius of Caesarea, details the career of the Roman emperor who finally legitimized Christianity in 313. It has to be read as what it is — a political hagiography, written to convince skeptical Christians that Constantine was truly one of them (he did not, himself, formally convert until just before his death in 337) and at the same time to paint Constantine in the most favorable light possible in political terms. It’s a highly selective treatment that would not have been universally accepted by all Romans (Christians and otherwise) in it’s time — it’s as far from a warts-and-all portrait as could be imagined.

If you want warts, check out the __[The Secret History](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Anecdota/home.html)__ __of Procopius,__  which concerns the doings of the imperial court in the reign of emperor Justinian (527–565). It’s a kind of trashy tabloid treatment of the emperor and his wife, Theodora, written by a court official who was (ironically) one of Justinian’s most important propagandists. It’s as close as the ancient world has to offer to the National Enquirer, and is not much more reliable — but it’s a great worm’s-eye view of a late-Roman imperial court.

Another great source for personal life in late antiquity are collections of letters, of which there are several. The __[letters of Hieronymus](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/NPNF2-06/Npnf2-06-03.htm)__ , aka St. Jerome, the translator of the Latin bible are probably the most famous: while much of the correspondence concerns abstruse theological material it’s also a priceless look at how a 5th century scholar with contacts all over the Roman world thought and spoke in private. His letters include his own reactions to [Sack of Rome in 410](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001128.htm) and the tumultuous politics of the Roman empire in a moment of terrible crisis. For a very different world view there are the letters of the arch-conservative pagan aristocrat __[Symmachus](https://www.scribd.com/document/356368983/SYMMACHUS-Letters-1-%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AC-pdf)__ ____ and the domestic poetry of his contemporary, __[Ausonius](https://archive.org/stream/deciausonius01ausouoft/deciausonius01ausouoft_djvu.txt)__ . __[Late Antique Letter Collections](https://books.google.com/books/about/Late_Antique_Letter_Collections.html?id=SmE3DQAAQBAJ)__  is a great resource for these first-person views of life in this period.

Another source for biographies in this period is a bit harder to deal with: one of the most popular genres in late-Roman literature (in both Latin and Greek) are hagiographies: biographies of saints. Typically these were written with a very explicit religious purpose in mind, and many of them are filled mostly with miracle stories or exemplary tales of virtues. However there are also quite a few which contain solid, mundane biographical material. The _[Acta Sanctorum](https://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2012/06/19/volumes-of-the-acta-sanctorum-online/)_ __ or “Acts of the saints” is a vast collection of hagiographies, assembled painstakingly over the last 300 years. Unfortunately the only online version that’s publicly available is a massive collection of PDF’ed scans, and the primary index is not by name or date but by the saints’ feast days and the texts are all in their original languages (Latin, Greek, Syriac and Coptic) so the originals are usually not accessible for laypeople. Because there is so much source material there is an abundance of scholarly commentary on saints’ lives, though much of it comes from very theoretical perspectives that may be almost as hard to wade through as a Coptic papyrus.
