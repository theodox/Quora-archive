# Should I give up on 3D modeling because it requires so much work and time that I don’t have? I feel like it’s time to start something new, like programming or UI design, using other art mediums.

It really depends on what you want out of it.

Getting a paying job in 3d — particularly in games, where the competition is fierce. If you’re self-teaching in Blender and you don’t feel like you’re making progress, the likelihood that you’re on the track to a _paying_  job isn’t great. However you may get a lot more energy out of being part of a larger project — an indie game, a student film, or just a local developer group. Working in isolation is tough (and it’s psychologically harder when you compare your self-taught efforts with the best work from Hollywood or the games business). A group project gives you some momentum, a chance to learn from colleagues, and a little bit of external pressure to keep you productive.

But, if you’re looking for a new creative outlet — well, that’s a lot more of a personal thing. 3d definitely is a lot of work and time — but so is programming or web dev. Depending on your temperament you may find one of the more techie, less artsy options more satisfying or more puzzling and frustrating.

If you really want to go down the dark path, [become a technical artist](http://tech-artists.org) or start an game project in [Unity ](https://unity3d.com/)and see where that takes you. You’ll at least find a good test case for seeing how 3d and development go together and which one really suits you better. In neither case, though, are you going to be reveling in your new-found free time.
