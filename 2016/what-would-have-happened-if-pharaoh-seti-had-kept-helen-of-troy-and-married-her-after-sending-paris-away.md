You might want to check out [The Hittite ](http://us.macmillan.com/thehittite/benbova)by Ben Bova, which takes Helen to Egypt under the wing of the titular character at the end of the war. It's written in a way which begs a sequel, though I haven't heard one being announced.



The obvious (to me) place to go with this however is to tweak the dates a bit: instead of Seti, your philandering Pharaoh is [Ramesses III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_III) who is still in about the right time range, towards the late estimate for the destruction of Troy (between 1200 and 1150 BC). 

Ramses, after all, had to cope with a titanic sea-borne invasion: the [Sea Peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples) who swept all before them along the Levantine coasts absolutely included the _Ekwesh,_ possibly Homer's [Achaeans ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaeans_(Homer))-- and the _Denyen ,_ who may be his [Danaans. ](http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Danaans)You can throw in some really twisted history if you want to follow Herodotus and many other Greek authors who claimed the descent of the Danaid dynasty of Argos from Egypt -- it's all a sick family plot among cousins! 

The outraged Menelaus -- driven by a titanic passion? manipulated by his scheming brother Agamemnon -- becomes the charismatic figurehead of a huge international coalition against the Egyptians. Odysseus provides the logistical support despite knowing that it's a doomed effort. The fractious group - not just Greeks (who, on their own would never stand a chance against mighty Egypt) but a ragtag band of misfits and outcasts from every corner of the crumbling ancient world (maybe you can throw in some climate change and a refugee crisis to keep it all topical too). 

These underdogs -- driven by desperation and romance -- stake everything on a massive invasion of Egypt, which culminates at the epic [Battle of the Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Delta) in 1175.

_Those who reached my boundary, their seed is not; their hearts and their souls are finished forever and ever. As for those who had assembled before them on the sea, the full flame was their front before the harbour mouths, and a wall of metal upon the shore surrounded them. They were dragged, overturned, and laid low upon the beach; slain and made heaps from stern to bow of their galleys, while all their things were cast upon the water._ 

 The heartless Pharoah defeats the rebel coalition and stalks, Vader-like, through the heaps of the dead with his captive bride at his side. (unless it's a heroic pharoah, saving civilzation from the Mad-Max style lunatics who already savaged Troy...)

Odysseus escapes, but [Neoptolemus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoptolemus) -- who plays the "Achilles" role -- is found dead among the captives after a spectacular death in battle. Maybe you can throw in a subplot in which Helen helps Helenus -- one of Priams' sons who survived the war -- kill him off hand-to-hand and take over his lands in Thessaly. Does Menelaus rescue Helen at last, leading the domestic scenes in _Odyssey?_ Does she intercede with the Pharoah to let him off even though she stays in Egypt? Perhaps the famous _eidolon --_ the legendary 'false Helen' -- becomes a device for her and Menelaus to deceive the Pharoah the same way the pharoah deceived Paris! 

It all ends up with an ironic, alt-history new meaning to the [The Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III](http://www.realhistoryww.com/world_history/ancient/Misc/Medinet_Habu/Medinet_Habu.htm)
