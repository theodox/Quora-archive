Lua:

smaller executable

good threading support

lightweight interpreter, easy to embed in other applications

c-style syntax


Python:


huge standard library

lots of 3d party libraries

functional programming constructs

good debugging tools

metaprogramming


In general, Lua is better at embedding and narrowly target uses, Python is better for big systems and those that work with lots of other protocols and formats, such as web frameworks or scientific computing.

Here's a Lua fan's take on the comparison: [Lua Versus Python](http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaVersusPython) and a more general one: [Why Python and not Lua?](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/66590/why-python-and-not-lua)
