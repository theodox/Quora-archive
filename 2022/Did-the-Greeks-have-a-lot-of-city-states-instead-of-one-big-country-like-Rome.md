The direct answer is “yes,” but if you look at things in detail it’s a little more nuanced.

__Not just Greece__ 

If you only look at Greece, you might think the “city-state” is somehow uniquely Greek. In fact, though, the city-state was one of the most common societal forms in the Iron Age Mediterranean, particularly in the years between about 800 and 350 BC.

If you lived within a week or so’s walk from the sea you were probably part of a city-state. Most of Italy was dominated by city-states before the Romans united the peninsula, with Etruscans in the north, Greeks in the south, and a several different Italic peoples in the center. Phoenicia was a collection of city-states, and the early Phoenician colonies in the western Mediterranean were originally organized as city states too. There were also less well-known polities which could reasonably be described as city-states in Sardinia, in southern Iberia, on the coasts of Asia Minor, up the Adriatic, and in the Black Sea.

The Iron-Age Mediterranean city-state was a common evolutionary step for societies that had outgrown purely kinship-based politics and economics. The “city” component provided a highly defensible central refuge. In an age where piracy and small-scale banditry were universal, a stout set of walls was a wise insurance policy (this probably helps explain why city-states tended cluster near the sea: sea-borne threats could appear without warning, much faster than a raiding party on foot). The “state” component facilitated trade: a city with established and predictable laws was a lot more attractive to traders than the unstable authority of a tribal chief, particularly a chief who may have been a part-time pirate or bandit. The combination of security and trade helped to create more diversified economies, which in turn helped create something like a “middle class” of craftspeople and traders who were rich enough to chase luxuries and social status — opportunities that were much harder to come by in tribal society where kinship ties and warfare were the only true markers of status.

_There’s a reason why one of the classics on the emergence of Greek cities is titled “_ ___from Citadel to City-State”___ 

All in all there there thousands of city-states from Gibraltar to Georgia. Greece and overseas Greek colonies accounted for more than a thousand; Italy and Sicily were was home to hundreds. Most of these were “cities” only by courtesy — a town of 1,500 people, as long as it was mostly self-governing and had a decent set of walls , was still a “city” in this sense.

__Rise and Fall of the Hedgehog State__ 

The defensibility of the cities was the key. In the early Iron Age almost nobody in the Mediterranean world had the technology or the resources to take a well fortified city. So most local conflicts would end in “turtling” — the losing side would retreat within its walls and wait out the attackers. Very small places were eventually absorbed by bigger neighbors but the process was very slow: while the Athenians and Spartans were squaring off for the Peloponnesian War, Rome was fighting neighbors like [Fidenae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidenae) and [Veii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veii#:~:text=Veii%20(also%20Veius%3B%20Italian%3A,in%20the%20comune%20of%20Rome.). Veii — captured in 396 BC after on-and-off wars going back centuries — is only an afternoon’s walk from the Roman forum.

_Rome to Veii: for centuries, this was the route which armies travelled as the two cities tried and failed to subdue each other._ 

However the city-state system had one critical limitation: there was a cap on the ability of any city-state to defend itself. In Mesopotamia and Asia Minor there were large territorial states with resources and manpower that no single city could match. The first city-states to fall were in the east, closer to those big centralized kingdoms. The Phoenicians were subjugated first by the Assyrian Empire in the 9th century, then by the Babylonians in the 7th. In Asia Minor the kingdom of Lydia absorbed the Greek cities of the coast in the 6th century, before it in turn was conquered by the Persians..

The shining historical moment of the city-states was the Greek resistance to the Persian invasion. Although Athens and Sparta are both known as city-states, each was in fact a growing territorial state as well: the Athenian hinterland was about fourteen hundred square miles (~ 3,800 km2 ) and Sparta controlled almost four thousand (~ 8500 km2) . For a few months most of Greece managed to put aside the perennial local conflicts and unite against the Persians. The Greek victory over the world’s most powerful empire showed how much untapped potential was being frittered away in endless petty conflicts between Greek cities.

But despite that potential, the city states were ultimately overshadowed by the growth of a local territorial kingdom. Macedonia was culturally Greek but politically quite distinct: it was a centralized military monarchy based on a rural peasantry, rather than an urban society. Big, well trained Macedonian armies swept aside the city-state militias and political genius of [Philip II](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/philip-ii-of-macedonia/) exploited the perpetual divisions among the cities — within a single generation Macedonia became the dominant state in the Greek heartland, only a century and a half after the Persians had been defeated. Then, using Philip’s conquests as a springboard, Alexander the Great toppled the Persian empire. Suddenly the city state had become irrelevant: what city of fifty or a hundred thousand citizens could hope to resist an empire stretching from Ithaca to India?

__Persistence__ 

If you wanted to draw a line under the age of the city states, you’d probably do it in 338 BC, when Philip defeated the last desperate alliance of independent cities at [Chaeronea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chaeronea_(338_BC)). After that almost no city-state in the Greek world was a first-class political actor: the politics of the next several centuries would be dominated by the big kingdoms which emerged from the wreckage of Alexander’s empire.

But, despite their irrelevance on the world political stage the city-states remained vital. The new kingdoms were very heterogenous and tended to rely on local collaborators and local institutions. In most of the Greek world you still had vibrant (“vicious” is sometimes more accurate) local politics , local culture, and local loyalties. You might legally be a subject of one or another Macedonian king but you almost certainly thought of yourself as a citizen of the city you were born in. If Great Power politics created the right conditions a city could still rouse itself for a fight —- though usually the fight was just to switch allegiances from one foreign kingdom to another. Our modern maps will show you the Greek world after Alexander as a few big colored blocks but fundamentally the Hellenistic kingdoms were still based on city-states: just city states which no longer had control over their own foreign policies.

_A snapshot of the Greece as it looked under the Hellenistic kingdoms. The “Independent states” here are no longer city-states (apart from Athens) but federations intended to counterbalance Macedonian power. In reality even the nominally independent states were constantly under pressure from the great powers of the day_ 

That combination of local patriotism and global weakness helps explain why Greece was absorbed so quickly and effectively by Rome, starting around a century and a half after Alexander’s death. While the Greek city states of the eastern Mediterranean were swallowed up quickly, the many cities of the west were being conquered piecemeal by Rome.

The Roman system was a sort of city-state pyramid scheme: as the Romans expanded their power, they were very canny about assimilating their defeated rivals into their empire. A defeated enemy was reduced to a Roman “ally” — no longer fully free, but at least as independent as a Greek city under a Hellenistic king. Most importantly the upper classes of a newly-Romanized city were invited to become Romans themselves — the most ambitious ones could be come Roman citizens, run for Roman office, command Roman armies, and share in the spoils of empire. Over time this produced and empire-wide ruling class the reinforced the strength of the Roman system and harnessed the strength of the subject peoples very effectively. The loyalty of Greek cities to the Hellenistic kingdoms was rarely more than skin deep; small scale double dealing was the essence of Hellenistic politics. The Romans, by contrast, managed to hang on to their subjects-cum-allies under very trying circumstances: Hannibal rampaged around Italy for two decades but only managed to convince a handful of cities to switch sides.

_Roman expansion into the patchwork world of 3d century BC Italy. This map only shows larger cities — there are many left out (there should be about 40 cities in Sicily, for example) ._ 

When the Romans arrived in Greece in the second century BC, they were able to exploit the longstanding mutual distrust of the cities and the big Hellenistic kingdoms. A Roman protectorate was less irksome to many that the presence of Macedonian garrison, and the upward mobility offered by the Roman system was attractive to many in the leadership classes of the Greek world. Daily life remained centered around the local community well into the second century of our era, when the economic and social opportunities of a vast empire began to focus the ambitions of the upper classes on the imperial rather than the local level.

__TLDR__ 

The Roman state behaved like a large territorial state, because it retained a remarkably tight set of political priorities for a long span of time. The Greeks, on the other hand, were much more jealously concerned with local independence which made it hard for them to cooperate either as opponents or as citizens of bigger powers. But despite those two very different patterns of behavior there were many deep structural similarities in the age of city-states : if you don’t focus on big-picture geopolitics the similarities often outweigh the differences.
