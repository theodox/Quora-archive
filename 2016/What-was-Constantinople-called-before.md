Before it was _Constantinopolis_  the main settlement in on the site of Constantinople was the Greek city of [Byzantion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantium)

_A coin of the city-state of Byzantion, around 330 BC. The cow-and-dolphin motif recalls the legend of_ _[Io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(mythology))_ _, who swam across the Bosporus in the form of a cow._ 

It was founded by Greeks from Megara in central Greece in the middle of the 7th century BC and retained that name for about a thousand years apart from a brief period when it was renamed _Augusta Antonina_ by the emperor Septimius Severus. Roman emperors frequently 're-founded' existing cities, giving them new names and sometimes special privileges -- but these new names rarely stuck.

Sometimes, however, they did. In 330 AD Emperor Constantine settled on the site as a new capital for the Roman empire, redubbing the site _Nova Roma_  or New Rome.* There were several alternate designations as well: 

δευτέρα Ῥώμη, "second Rome"

_Alma Roma_ , Ἄλμα Ῥώμα (_alma_  an adjective meaning 'nurturing' or 'fond', as in _alma mater)_ 

Βυζαντιάς Ῥώμη, "Byzantine Rome"

ἑῴα Ῥώμη, "Eastern Rome"

 _Roma Constantinopolitana_ .

Βασιλεύουσα, "the reigning city"

The city grew very fast as it became apparent that the location was both economically and military critical -- within 150 years it had surpassed Rome in population. Around the same time Κωνσταντινούπολις, our Constantinople, won out over the others and became the most common name for the city.

_The mosaics from the imperial palace in Constantinople are a fascinating glimpse of a kind of late-Roman culture we don't see much of: this is, theoretically, the art of the 'decline and fall' but it feels light and self-confident._ 

However for much of it's later history it was just "the City": the only city that really mattered -- at least if you were a Greek. The modern Turkish name _Istanbul_  is a corruption of the the Greek phrase εις την Πόλιν_"into the city"_ 



* Moving the capital was less shocking than you might think: Rome had not been politically critical for nearly a century at that point -- real power lay with the emperor, not the Senate, and during the [lousy days of the third century](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/thirdcenturycrisis_article_01.shtml) the emperors spent far more time leading armies in the field than lounging around the palace. Other imperial capitals of the time included
