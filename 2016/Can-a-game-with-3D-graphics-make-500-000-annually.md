A successful game makes a lot more than that. Undertale, for example, has sold about 1.5 million copies on Steam, which should work out to around $15,000,000 (that’s a guess based on [steamspy](http://steamspy.com/app/391540).)

The hard part, unfortunately, is being “successful”. Between 80 and 90 per cent of games don’t make back the money it cost to make them: entertainment tends to be a winner-take-all market where the winners win big and there’s not a lot left over for everybody else. Moreover, you also need to remember [the developers only see a fraction of the sales revenue.](https://www.quora.com/If-I-create-a-moderately-successful-AAA-game-will-I-become-a-millionaire/answer/Steve-Theodore)

One strategy that can work very well if $500,000 is a target is to find an underserved market. A great example is the [Train Simulator ](http://store.steampowered.com/app/24010/)franchise — it will never come within four orders of magnitude of _Destiny_  for total revenue, but it’s way more profitable because it caters to a small but loyal and enthusiastic audience.

Indie games — which are made with much smaller teams and budgets — can also hit that half-million mark by keeping the production costs low. Clever design and fresh, but low-cost artwork can be a good way to grab players. Unfortunately the barrier to entry in the indie business is nonexistent so it’s incredibly competitive: not only do most indie games not make a profit, a very large fraction of them effectively make no money at all. Indie is like being in a rock back: it can work out, but be careful about quitting your day job.

The other thing to remember is that games are episodic: when you finish one, you have to make another — after a couple of years players will have moved on for reasons of tech or just changes in taste. So to make the $500,000 a year you’ll need to either produce a big game every few years or release DLC and expansion packs to keep the revenue coming in. Balancing the risk and reward of infrequent big releases, and the constant treadmill of smaller releases is hard and many game companies don’t really know how to do it consistently: even behemoth franchises like _Call of Duty_ or _Civilization_  have to worry about staying relevant for more than a few years.
