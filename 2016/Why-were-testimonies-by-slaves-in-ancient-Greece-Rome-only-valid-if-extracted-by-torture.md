# Why were testimonies by slaves in ancient Greece/Rome only valid if extracted by torture?

For two reasons:

First, the assumption (not always correct) that a slave would be loyal to and unwilling to testify against his own master.

Secondly, the belief (far more certainly correct) that a slave was unable to testify in ways his or her master didn’t want: a master, with power of life or death over the slave (and possible the slave’s children) could order a slave to testify in any way that was convenient. The use of torture was intended to counterbalance the slaves’ fear of their masters and force them to tell the truth.

The problem of getting accurate testimony from people completely under the power of others was really insoluble. In most cases slave testimony wasn’t sought aggressively. Different shifts were tried — for example, the magistrate trying a case could simply buy the slaves and order them to tell him the truth — but juries were quite suspicious of slave testimony and a case relying entirely on slave statements was a weak case. So slave testimony wasn’t that common in formal trials.

It was, however, pretty common to demand slaves from the _other_ side in the case be tortured, though their owners could and usually did refuse to hand them over: You can see this trick in [Lycurgus, Against Leocrates](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0152%3Aspeech%3D1%3Asection%3D29) where he clearly tries to use the opposition’s refusal to provide slaves for torture as evidence of guilt, like “taking the 5th.” You’ll definitely hear lawyers claiming things like this when it’s convenient:

> You Athenians hold the opinion that both in public and in private matters examination under torture is the most searching test; and so, when you have slaves and free men before you and it is necessary that some contested point should be cleared up, you do not employ the evidence of free men but seek to establish the truth about the facts by putting the slaves to torture. This is a perfectly reasonable course; for you are well aware that before now witnesses have appeared not to be giving true evidence, whereas no one who has been examined under torture has ever been convicted of giving false evidence as the result of being tortured.

Isaeus, [Isaeus, Ciron](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Isaeus%208.12&lang=original)

But the lawyers for the other side would have made the obvious retort:

> I need not remind you, I think, that witnesses under torture are biassed in favor of those who do most of the torturing; they will say anything likely to gratify them. It is their one chance of salvation, especially when the victims of their lies happen not to be present. Had I myself proceeded to give orders that the slave should be racked for not telling the truth, that step in itself would doubtless have been enough to make him stop incriminating me falsely.

Antiphon, [On the murder of Herodes](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Antiph.%205.32&lang=original)

Also, in any slave society there’s a strong social consensus against allowing slaves to inform on their own masters (again, the incentives of the unfree are very powerful). One of the complaints against the more paranoid emperors (Nero, Caligula _et al_ ) was that they allowed slaves to denounce their masters — a procedure which brought about predictable results, although in the case of emperors who helped fund their rule on the proceeds of treason convictions that may be by design.

You can get a good sense of the anxieties surrounding slave testimony in Cicero’s [For King Deiotarius](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0020%3Atext%3DDeiot.%3Asection%3D1), his last trial speech, marking the exact turning point between the old Republican system of public justice and what would become the new, palace-centered version. [Deiotarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deiotarus), a Galatian princeling, was accused by his own grandson of plotting to assassinate Caesar on the testimony of a slave (who, as you’ll see, gave his testimony _without_ torture):

> But when I saw the countenance and heard the words of this runaway slave, accusing his master,—his absent master,—his master, who was a most devoted friend to our republic,—I did not feel so much grief at the depressed condition of the monarch himself, as fear for the general fortunes of every one. For though, according to the usage of our ancestors, it is not lawful to examine a slave as a witness against his master, not even by torture,—in which mode of examination pain might, perhaps, elicit the truth from a man even against his will,—a slave has arisen, who, without any compulsion, accuses him against whom he might not legally say a word even on the rack.

It’s also an interesting read because it’s so clear that Cicero is completely awake to the resonances of debating the value of slave testimony while he himself is addressing the _dictator perpetuus_  who holds effective power of life and death over every Roman.



For a good modern take on the madness of slave law, Avram Davidson’s short story _The Necessity of his Condition_  is a must-read.
