In addition to the excellent advice on this thread I’d add two more things:

Brush up on your English grammar! Most classical language learning material tends to assume a higher standard of grammatical knowledge than your average US college does. If you don’t know what a “mood” is when discussing a verb, or you’re not clear on the difference between an imperfect, a perfect and a pluperfect, or you aren’t sure you know the difference between the direct and indirect object of a sentence… it’ll be hard. The concepts aren’t really that esoteric, but if you haven’t been taught them, or if you haven’t been taught them recently, a good refresher will eliminate one source of confusion.

Learn to pay attention to accents and diacritical marks. The Greek alphabet, by itself, is not too hard but the accents and breath marks are very important in Greek and it’s a good idea to go in knowing that. If you mentally mark them down as ‘details’ you’ll run into a bunch of avoidable issues.

If you can find a course or learning material with an audio component, go for it. Learning a language entirely by eye is much harder than involving your ears! When it comes to all of those noun and verb endings, go ahead and learn them sing-song style, it’s far easier to make them habitual if you involve your auditory memory.

Find people you can study with — nothing beats real human study partners.
