Python is an easier language to learn and probably a better place to start. Once you're used to dealing with logic and program flow in general you'll be better equipped to tackle all of the low-level stuff that C++ throws at you. Learning basic concepts at the same time as all the advanced stuff is a recipe for discouragement.
