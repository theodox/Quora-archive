It’s hard to know, of course — Hannibal’s army was very heterogeneous, with a wide variety of different contingents and at least half a dozen major languages. Alexander’s original force was much more tightly knit. On the other hand it was also a lot simpler — Hannibal did have a century and a half of military evolution on Alexander, including things like the beginnings of field artillery and the availability of elephants.

All that said, Hannibal himself said (at least, in public) that Alexander was the better general:

> When Africanus asked who, in Hannibal's opinion, was the greatest general, Hannibal named Alexander, the king of the Macedonians, because with a small force he has routed armies innumerable and because he has traversed the most distant region_s_ , even to see which transcended human hopes. To the next request, as to whom he would rank second, Hannibal selected Pyrrhus, saying that he had been the first to teach the art of castrametation, besides no one had chosen his ground or placed his troops more discriminatingly; he possessed also the art of winning men over to him, so that the Italian people preferred the lordship of a foreign king to that of the Roman people, so long the master in that land. When [Scipio] continued, asking whom Hannibal considered third, he named himself without hesitatiion.

its of course a semi-legendary echange, and clearly Hannibal is tweaking Scipio’s nose a bit by naming himself as number three. However the interview wrapped up like this:

> Then Scipio broke into a laugh and said, “What would you say if you had defeated me?” “Then, beyond doubt,” he replied, “I should place myself both before Alexander and before Pyrrhus and before all other generals.”
