Yes. Rome was a very successful assimilationist society. They started off by incorporating the elites of nearby Italian cities, allowing at least the upper classes of former enemies to become Roman. By the middle of the first century BC all of Italy was “Roman” for legal purposes even though there were dozens of nationalities in the peninsula. In the next couple of centuries Roman citizenship expanded even faster, including people from all over the Mediterranean and Western Europe. Finally in 212 AD all free persons in the empire — which at that point included everyone from Scotland to Syria — were made citizens. By the fourth century the majority of Roman emperors [were not of Roman or even Italian descent](https://www.quora.com/Were-most-Emperors-of-the-Roman-Empire-born-in-what-is-now-Italy).

A really interesting example of Roman attitudes is preserved in the speech that emperor Claudius delivered to the senate when the Romans first accepted Gauls into the Senate:

> My ancestors, the most ancient of whom was made at once a citizen and a noble of Rome, encourage me to govern by the same policy of transferring to this city all conspicuous merit, wherever found. And indeed I know, as facts, that the Julii came from Alba, the Coruncanii from Camerium, the Porcii from Tusculum, and not to inquire too minutely into the past, that new members have been brought into the Senate from Etruria and Lucania and the whole of Italy, that Italy itself was at last extended to the Alps, to the end that not only single persons but entire countries and tribes might be united under our name. We had unshaken peace at home; we prospered in all our foreign relations, in the days when Italy beyond the Po was admitted to share our citizenship, and when, enrolling in our ranks the most vigorous of the provincials, under colour of settling our legions throughout the world, we recruited our exhausted empire. Are we sorry that the Balbi came to us from Spain, and other men not less illustrious from Narbon Gaul? Their descendants are still among us, and do not yield to us in patriotism.

> What was the ruin of Sparta and Athens, but this, that mighty as they were in war, they spurned from them as aliens those whom they had conquered? Our founder Romulus, on the other hand, was so wise that he fought as enemies and then hailed as fellow-citizens several nations on the very same day.
