There was definitely a project, but we don’t know how much work was ever done.

The source is in [Sozomen](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/jewish/julian-jews.asp). He reproduces a letter of Julian’s encouraging the Jews to rebuild the temple, which is usually regarded as genuine. In Sozomen’s account the rebuilding project was interrupted by an earthquake and fire, which he believed to be miraculous.

Modern historians are not sure there was ever any concrete work done at all; some think the earthquake and fire are inventions by the hostile chronicler. However the timeline of the project was very short, perhaps too short for archaeologically significant work to be done. The idea was floated at the beginning of Julian’s preparation for war with Persia in mid-362, and was obviated by his death in the summer of 363.

Julian presumably enjoyed the idea that the rebuilding of the temple would falsify what his contemporaries saw as Jesus’ prediction of the destruction of the temple, which had been destroyed by the Romans in the year 70. However he probably also reflected on the fate of Trajan’s campaign against the Parthians in 115, which was [bedeviled by a major rising among Jewish communities in the eastern half of the Roman empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War) (the large Jewish community in Mesopotamia, with no love for the Romans, encouraged their fellows in the Roman world to revolt). The temple building project provided some guarantee against a repeat of that while also irritating Julian’s Christian enemies.
