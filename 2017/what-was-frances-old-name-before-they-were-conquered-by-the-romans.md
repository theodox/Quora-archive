The Romans knew the area as ‘[Gallia](https://www.ancient.eu/gaul/)’, in English ‘ Gaul’ or ‘the land of the Gauls’ — although there’s no reason to think that has to do with what the locals called it.

The Greeks — who settled at [Massilia](https://www.ancient.eu/massilia/), modern Marseille and a few other points along the Mediterranean coast — knew the area as ‘Keltika’, ‘the land of the Celts’ but again this was not a local name.

Gaul, Celt and Kelt are all modern terms for the same collection of peoples, who inhabited most of what’s now France but also considerable parts of the British Isles, Central Europe, northen Italy, and the Balkans. They shared some cultural and linguistic traits but never formed a unified state or empire: part of the reason the Romans were able to conquer Gaul so quickly was because the various peoples living there fought each other as fiercely as they did the Romans. The largest states were tribal confederations like the [Aedui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedui) or the [Sequani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequani), each of whom might have controlled about ten percent of modern France. None of these states was stable over long periods of time — alliances changed all the time, and no single group of Gauls ever dominated even a majority of modern France.

This gives an idea of how complex it was:
