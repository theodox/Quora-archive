For simplicity’s sake I’ll restrict this to roughly the 250 years from Julius Caesar until the year 212.

In the early empire, movement of people wasn’t directly controlled (at least, as long as we are talking with individuals and not, say, an armed barbarian war-band waving swords around). In ordinary times the Roman frontiers [were policed](https://www.quora.com/How-did-old-kingdoms-and-empires-know-where-the-border-was-How-would-a-Roman-citizen-know-where-Rome-ends-and-the-barbaric-tribes-begin/answer/Steve-Theodore), but mostly with an eye towards collecting tolls and import duties. Unless there was a war on your movements were mostly unrestricted _by the empire._ Local laws, however could vary wildly.

As a modern person thinking about immigration, it’s natural to view citizenship as the end goal of the migrant. But the ancient equation was different: in this period citizenship was primarily about _privileges_  rather than _rights._ For outsiders, therefore, it came with a pricetag, one that many could not or would not pay. Citizenship in many ways was just another marker of social status and privilege — but there were others that could be just as important in practice: in tribal areas there were traditional hierarchies and clans; in client kingdoms there were hereditary nobilities and royal favorites; and every city in the empire there were local political structures with local rules and distinctions. Roman citizenship was just the most prestigious and most widely useful brand of citizenship in a crowded market.

We don’t have reliable statistics but the percentage of free people who were actually _Roman_  citizens was probably 15% or less across the empire as a whole. The numbers might have reached 75% in Italy, but they’d drop to single digits in the less developed or more recently conquered regions.

So, as an immigrant your aspirations had to adapt to local realities. In a Greek city, you might be able to buy local citizenship — at least, as long as you spoke passable Greek and had a pretty fat purse. In Egypt, on the other hand, it was hard to fit in as an outsider: there much of the population (and almost all of the native Egyptian population) needed special permission to leave their home towns; there, civic rights and freedom of movement were jealously guarded privileges.

Its impossible to describe the complete scope of all the ways different communities privileged their own citizens relative to outsiders. In general, however, there were four common factors:

The community got to set the rules. Citizenship was a privilege and its was policed aggressively. Lawsuits trying to settle who was or was not a citizen of what polity were common. Birthright citizenship or naturalization through marriage (for men, anyway) were vanishingly rare. Most often descent from known citizen parents and a property qualification was the bar.

Political participation (limited to local affairs in this imperial era) was restricted to citizens.

Citizens typically had stronger legal protections than outsiders: trials by jury instead of by a magistrate, protection from capital punishment or enslavement.

Citizens and non-citizens paid different taxes.

Full Roman citizenship reflected these principles as well on a larger scale. Roman citizens were exempt from the much-hated poll tax. Only they were eligible for many coveted honors and positions. Roman citizens could not be tried by a provincial court (Bible readers will recall that St. Paul, a Roman citizen, had to be take to Rome for trial because his status protected him from provincial authorities). And — in many ways the most important element — outside of Italy Roman citizenship was a powerful status marker, proof that a particular provincial had “made it” in imperial society.

The one sure-fire way for an outsider to make his way into Roman citizenship was to serve in the __army__ . Only citizens could serve as legionaries — but legionaries made up slightly under half the army. In principle the other half, the _[auxilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxilia)_ , were “allied” troops provided by the many client states that populated the fringes of the empire, but in practice the ethnic character of these units was somewhat negotiable: if you could talk your way in or had relevant skills (armies need bridgebuilders and muleteers as well as warriors) you were on the path to full Roman citizenship. If you survived the 25 years necessary to earn your discharge, pension, and toga, you’d be a full citizen with all the rights and privileges. If you managed to get yourself into a veteran colony you might get a land grant, you could run for political office, and maybe even make your way into the fringes of the provincial upper classes. Your children could live the Roman dream — though you might not live to see it, since the average life span in this period was around 50, and you would not be legally allowed to start a family until your retirement in your early 40’s.

The other simple path from outsider to citizen was __money__ . With enough ready cash it was possible to buy your way into citizenship, even if the trade was genteelly disguised as some form of reward for a public-spirited friend of Rome. It could be easier (and cheaper) to buy your way into one of the many local citizenries — if you decided to settle down somewhere and could pass whatever local hurdles there were to full participation you’d be on a higher legal footing than the majority of the free population of the empire.

Ironically the third way to become a citizen was __slavery.__  The slave of a Roman citizen, if manumitted, was granted a kind of second-class citizenship (the main limitations were on political participation and access to some kinds of offices). The children of a freedman or freedwomen were full citizens. Manumission was far from uncommon, though it was not evenly distributed; the rate may have been as high as around 50% overall, much higher for skilled professionals and much lower for, say, unskilled laborers. Some kinds of slaves (captured enemies and criminals) were almost impossible to manumit, but as a somebody who had voluntarily sold yourself into slavery — a not unheard of outcome — you’d presumably have a better chance than most… assuming you could trust your new master, since you would not have any legal right to enforce a promise of eventual freedom.

This complex, patchwork system changed radically after 212, when emperor Caracalla at a stroke turned every free inhabitant of the empire into a citizen. It was — depending on how you look at it — a noble gesture capping Rome’s long history of cultural inclusion, or a cynical ploy to expand the tax rolls. The later Roman empire actually did see something like “mass immigration” : after the chaos of the civil wars of the third century, climate change, and plagues had taken serious bites out of the Roman population the Romans allowed substantial barbarian groups to settle in their territories as a kind of “imported allies” — these groups had an ambiguous legal status in post-Caracallan law. But that’s a different story.



* That’s imperial to state, not counting local officials in either case. I’d be willing to be the ratios were equally lopsided at the local level, if not moreso.
