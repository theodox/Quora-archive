It’s an inscription celebrating the coronation of [Ptolemy V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes) in the spring of 196 BC. It’s not super exciting, it’s a list of royal achievement, titles and so on. It’s a bit interesting because of what it doesn’t mention: that at the time it was put up the Ptolemies were fighting a native insurgency Upper Egypt and that they had just lost a chunk territory (including Judea) to their rivals in the Seleucid empire. You’d never guess that from the stately, rather dull language of the text itself.

It’s very well studied, there are not likely to be any real big mysteries awaiting discovery. There are a few fragments of the same text from other parts of Egypt.

You can see the whole thing — in all three of its original languages, with interlinear translations, here — it’s a great chance to see how a real Egyptian text works in detail.

It’s also a bit of a rebuke to people who want to believe that the “real” meaning of the hieroglyphs is being kept from us — if this was a conspiracy, the whole thing would be a better read.
