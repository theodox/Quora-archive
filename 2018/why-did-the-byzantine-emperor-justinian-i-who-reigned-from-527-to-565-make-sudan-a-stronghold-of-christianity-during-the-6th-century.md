Justinian didn’t do it — it was a local initiative.

Sudan and Ethiopia had a long connection with Christianity, dating all the way back to the first century. The New Testament mentions [the conversion of an “Ethiopian”](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8:26-27) (the Greek word meant “dark-skinned person”) who served as the treasurer of the Queen of [Meroë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB): a kingdom north of modern Khartoum. It’s worth noting that the text says he had gone to Jerusalem to worship — the languages of southern Sudan and Ethiopia at this point were Semitic, and there were Jewish communities in the horn of Africa. There are non-Biblical mentions of missionary activity in the area as early as 180.

Around the year 328 the [Kingdom of Aksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum) — centered in modern Ethiopia and Eritrea, but including the old kingdom of Meroe in Sudan — converted in the reign of King [Ezana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezana_of_Axum). This was well before the official conversion of the Roman empire (in 380). In northern Sudan, the Roman client kingdom [Nobatia ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobatia)was evangelized by Constantinople in the later 4th century, but was part of the Egyptian church.

In general Rome and Axum had [distant but friendly relations](https://www.quora.com/Did-Rome-ever-attempt-to-take-over-Axum); they shared a common interest in keeping the Indian Ocean trade prosperous. During Justinian’s day the two states were also military allies. Justinian [was fighting the Sassanid Persian empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_War) (primarily in Syria, eastern Turkey, and Armenia). At the same time the Axumites were fighting in the Arabian peninsula, against the Jewish-Arab kingdom of [Himyar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himyarite_Kingdom) in what’s now Yemen. The Persians backed the Himyarites, so the Romans and Axumites had a common enemy. They cooperated in some diplomatic and military operations in Arabia.

After the rise of Islam in the next century, Axum was cut off from the rest of the Christian world. The disruptions in trade the came with the dismemberment of the old Roman common market also brought economic decline to Axum, although the kingdom lingered on until the 10th century. Modern Ethiopia is a descendant of Axum, with the [dynasty of Haile Selassie](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ethiopia/The-Zagwe-and-Solomonic-dynasties) claiming descent from the Axumite royal house as well as from the Biblical king Solomon.
