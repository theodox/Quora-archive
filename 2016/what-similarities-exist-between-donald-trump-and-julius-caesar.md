__Debt__ . Like Trump, Caesar was a massive spender of other people’s money in the early part of his career — although, in Caesar’s defense, he was in fact not well off financially as a young man, despite his toffy aristocratic background. Caesar was deeply in hock to a variety of money-men, most notably the uber-illuminatus [Crassus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Licinius_Crassus). He paid off his debts later when he contrived [a three way alliance between himself, Crassus and Pompey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Triumvirate) — killing off the Republic in the process.

__Showmanship__ . Particularly as a young man, Caesar assumed a very over-the-top, showy persona, distinguishing himself among the young men of his generation for his extravagant clothes (his schtick was flowing, fringed sleeves on his tunic and sort of male girdle). His extravagant tastes and showy public persona made many of his contemporaries regard him as a buffoon. However not everybody made the mistake of underestimating him — the dictator Sulla famously warned the Roman aristocracy to “beware of that boy with the floppy clothes”.

__Baldness__ . Caesar lost his hair quite early. Most of his official portraits disguise this fact but he was notoriously touchy about his receding hairline and obvious bald spot.

_the “Tusculum Caesar” takes an unusually frank approach to Caesar’s real hairstyle. The more often seen, Marlon-Brando hairstyle is generally used in posthumous representations from the age of Caesar’s heir, Augustus._ 

__Populism__ . Most seriously, Caesar and Trump both played in public the part of the class traitor: the child of privilege who is willing to stand up for ordinary folks against their so-called betters. They both had a good nose for the resentments that motivate the less well-off, and they both took great relish in tweaking the rules of polite society and outraging the sensibilities of the elite, while still managing to live like plutocrats.

The sincerity of Caesar’s populism has been a hot topic of debate for over two thousand years. While I have hard time imagining that anybody in the year 4062 will be much exercised about Trump’s motives it’s easy to see that opinions about how deeply he channels the authentic voice of The People are no more likely to settle on a final conclusion.
