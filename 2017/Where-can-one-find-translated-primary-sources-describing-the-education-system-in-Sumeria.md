There’s a chapter from Samuel Noah Kramer’s _The Sumerians_ [here](http://people.ucls.uchicago.edu/~cjuriss/ModernWorld/Documents/Jurisson-UNIT-2-Kramer-The-Sumerians-Education.pdf) which includes a bunch of primary material — Kramer was the first author to publish Sumerian school stuff back in the 40’s and 50’s. Here’s a [more recent article with translated texts](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.613.8674&rep=rep1&type=pdf (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.613.8674&rep=rep1&type=pdf). ) here. Some of the [texts in the Oxford Sumerian Corpus](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.5*#) touch on school themes. [An Anthology of Ancient Mesopotamian Texts](https://books.google.com/books?id=XYSbDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA96&dq=edubba&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjgmaXN9JHXAhVJ4GMKHTbNCi84ChDoAQgrMAE#v=onepage&q=edubba&f=false) includes some school related material.

The Sumerian world for “school” is usually transliterated as __eduba, edubba,__ or __e-duba__ so those are good search terms.
