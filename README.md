# Steve Theodore's Quora Archive

This is a bulk conversion of the answers I've written at [Quora](https://quora.com) since 2014 -- a bit of insurance for all of the content I've accumulated over the years. It's been scraped using the [downloader I wrote](https://github.com/theodox/quoradl), which is freely available at Github.  The overwhelming bulk of this material is about ancient history, with a particular focus on Greek, Roman, and Mesopotamian topics. However there's more than a smidgen of other stuff as well.  

> Note: I've had to tweak it in the past to accomodate changes in Quora's undocumented internal JavaScript display code -- if you run into an issue, log it in the issue tracker in the repo!

I did a very basic tagging scheme to sort these by topics, but it has not been carefully vetted. If you're just interested in reading it might be easier to just jump to my [Quora Profile?](https://www.quora.com/profile/Steve-Theodore) instead of trying to read these on GitHub. However here's an [index by years](index_years.md) and a somewhat spotty [index by topics](index_tags.md)
