In general, I've found that speaking is a more intense, emotional experience where writing is more cerebral. Connecting with an audience, really working a room is a much bigger thrill than even the most elegantly turned bit of prose.

 I do, however, find that doing a good talk is way, _way_  more work for me. I can bang out a 1000 word blog entry in a few hours, though to be fair most of my blogging is technical clarity rather than literary insight. 

 When I give talks, on the other hand, I don't usually feel like nerding out on technical minutia is a good use of anyones time, so I spend a lot of prep time on finding a natural-sounding, conversational way to approach my subject that can engage the people in the room. That appearance of spontaneity takes a _ton_  of prep work: for a GDC talk in March, I typically start 'improvising' in October.
