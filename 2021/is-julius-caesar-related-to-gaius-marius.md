Not directly — but his aunt [Julia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(wife_of_Marius))was Marius’ wife, and [Marius the Younger ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Marius_the_Younger)was thus his first cousin. A critical moment in Julius Caesar’s early career was his public funeral oration for Julia in 69 BC: it was the first time that images of Marius were displayed in public after the dictatorship of Sulla and the consequent purge of Marius’s supporters.

> A second and clearer instance of [popular] favour appeared upon his making a magnificent oration in praise of his aunt Julia, wife to Marius, publicly in the forum, at whose funeral he was so bold as to bring forth the images of Marius, which nobody had dared to produce since the government came into Sulla's hands, Marius's party having from that time been declared enemies of the state. When some who were present had begun to raise a cry against Caesar, the people answered with loud shouts and clapping in his favour, expressing their joyful surprise and satisfaction at his having, as it were, brought up again from the grave those honours of Marius, which for so long a time had been lost to the city.
