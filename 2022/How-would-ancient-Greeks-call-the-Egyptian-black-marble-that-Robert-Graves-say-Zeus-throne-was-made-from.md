This is most likely a reference to [Diorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diorite), a popular prestige stone for statuary in Egypt and Mesopotamia that was picked up by Greco-Roman artisans around the first century BC. Diorite is not really marble — it’s a much, much harder stone and much more labor intensive to work with; that’s one of the reasons it was a prestige material.

A Greek would mostly likely refer to it as __[βασανίτης λίθος](https://lsj.gr/wiki/%CE%B2%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AF%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82)__ __,__ ___basanites lithos,___ ____ literally “a touchstone-like stone” on account of its hardness. A [touchstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchstone_(assaying_tool)), a βάσανος, is a very hard stone you’d use to scratch gold or silver to see if it was pure. In Late Latin _basanites_ eventually morphed into __basaltes__ , which is the origin of our “[basalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt).”

In Greek “touchstone” — because it involves testing — is also a circumlocution for “torture.”
