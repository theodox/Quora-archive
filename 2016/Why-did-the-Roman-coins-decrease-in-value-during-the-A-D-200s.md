There was no such thing as ‘[fiat money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money)’ in the ancient world. Even the emperor needed to pay in hard cash. The value of the money was _supposed_  to be the value of its precious metal content; Caesar’s picture and the motto were merely intended as guarantees of the purity and weight of the metal.

However, running an empire is a complex business — even a Caesar can’t just decree tax increases or confiscations to meet every emergency. The [Third Century was a rough time, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century)for several reasons: plagues, barbarian wars, and above all a nearly endless succession of coups and counter-coups — from 235 to 285, the average emperor held the throne for only _one year._ 

It’s hardly a surprise that the Roman state was in terrible shape in those kinds of circumstances.

Paying the armies that had to defend the empire from external enemies was hard. There’s not much loot to be gained when playing defense. Paying them enough to keep them loyal to the current emperor was _even harder._ During this period the legions demanded ever higher “donatives” — that is, payoffs — from the emperors as the price of staying faithful. All the chaos in led to a noticeably dropoff in the prosperity of the Roman world, making the whole project even dicier.

With a shrinking economy and huge expenses, the emperors started to cheat: diluting their coins with more and more base metals to eke out more _denarii_  from less and less silver. There was no such thing as bonds, or even forced loans, or any other form of debt financing: if you didn’t get silver or gold into the physical coffers, you could only conjure more funds by melting down and re-casting what you did have into more and more debased coins.

_You can see the slide actually started before the 200’s but it really kicked in with Didius Julianus : the_ _[man who bought the Roman Empire at auction](http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/herodianus-didius.asp)_ _._ 

__[Edit: to address a question raised by Joachim Pense in the comments…]__ 

Did people on the street know? Absolutely: belief in weight-of-metal value was pretty much universal, so declines in coinage value were regarded as index of corruption — a sign that the government was out to cheat the populace. This sentiment goes back pretty far; here’s Aristophanes in 5th-century BC Athens, comparing the debased politicians of his days to city’s coinage — which had once been the most widely accepted in the Mediterranean, but after a generation of war was verging on worthless:

> We treat our best men
The way we treat our mint
The silver and the golden [coins]
We were proud to invent:
These pure
Genuine coins, no less,
Ringing true and tested
Both abroad and [in] Greece
And now they're not employed
As if we were disgusted
And want to use instead
These shoddy coppers minted
Only yesterday

_Frogs_ , 730ff.

(“Ringing true” here is κεκωδωνισμένοις, from the root as __κώδων__ , a bell — just like in English, the value of the coin is judged by the sound it makes when dropped). The analogy between personal virtue and pure coinage was a universal trope: here’s the Roman philosopher Epictetus:

> That was a good reply which Diogenes made to a man who asked him for letters of recommendation.—“That you are a man, he will know when he sees you;—whether a good or bad one, he will know if he has any skill in discerning the good and the bad. But if he has none, he will never know, though I write to him a thousand times.”—It is as though a piece of silver money desired to be recommended to some one to be tested. If the man be a good judge of silver, he will know: the coin will tell its own tale

And again, in passing.

> Think of the stamp in his mind with which he came into the world, such as we seek on coins: for if we find them, we approve of the coins, and if we do not find the marks, we reject them. “What is the image on this sestertius? The mark of Trajan? Give it to me! The mark of Nero? Throw it out: it’s worthless!”



At the end of the third century [Diocletian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian)tried to stabilize the state’s finances with what amounted to a modern artificial currency; he issued coins which were plainly and openly worth less in metal weight than their face values, and tried to back them up with [comprehensive system of price controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_on_Maximum_Prices). While the lists of prices he decreed are a goldmine for economic historians they were a flop in practice — they encouraged hoarding and drove many people to withdraw from the taxable urban cash economy onto self-sufficient rural estates, setting the stage for what we’d know as feudalism.
