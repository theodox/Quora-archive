There’s not lot of good pictorial evidence from Rome proper in this period. This is I think the only contemporary illustration of Roman warrior from that period:

_A fresco from Esquiline tomb 94, It’s not very informative but you can spot the bronze hoplite-style greaves, a tall Etruscan-style helmet, and a 6′ spear similar to a Greek doru. Image:_ _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquiline_Necropolis#/media/File:Affresco_con_scena_storica_della_necropoli_dell'esquilino.jpg)_ 

However we can get a pretty good approximation using other Italian sources from the same era. The Tomb of the Warrior from Lanuvium (about 35 miles from Rome, but in those days an independent state) gives a good example of sixth-century BC warrior equipment as a set:

As you can see, the Lanuvian equipment shows very strong Greek influences — the sword is a Greek-style [makhaira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhaira) and the breastplate shows the conventional muscled design.

Evidence from other Italian sites — particularly from the Etruscans, who dominated Rome in the later Royal period — shows that the fighting style in this period was also quite similar to the contemporary Greek mode based on close-order spearmen with large round shields.

This Etruscan bronze is dated to roughly the same date as the rise of the Roman Republic. You’ll note that it could almost pass for Greek — the decoration on the helmet is different but the large round _aspis_  style shield, the scale cuirass, and the overhand spear pose — for thrusting over the top of the shield — are all very similar to contemporary Greek armor and equipment. Early Etruscan shields like the above were flatter than their Greek contemporaries but they adopted the convex Greek bowl shape over time.

_This one’s another Etruscan piece, roughly contemporary with the end of the kingdom and again showing features reminiscent of contemporary Greek hoplite gear. The transverse helmet crest is interesting — it prefigures the later Roman centurion crests although we don’t know if there’s an actual connection.

This hoplite-style gear is what the wealthier classes of Romans were using as well — like most other city-state warriors in this period, the Romans had to provide their own equipment. [The ability to afford your own gear was the qualification for citizenship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servian_constitution). The round shield (in Latin, a _clipeus_ ) would be replaced by taller, narrower ovals in the Italian wars of the fourth century; the familiar legionary tower shield was later still.

One interesting distinction that was popular in later Italy and may go back as far as the Kingdom period is a sort of mini-breastplate, known in Greek as a [cardiophylax and in Latin as a pectoral.](https://www.res-bellica.com/en/about-pectorale-or-cardiophylax/?cn-reloaded=1) These were very common during the Roman wars of expansion in the fourth century and may date back to the fifth. This isn’t Etruscan, it’s from Picenum, but it gives a good idea of what a pectoral looked like:

Etruscan helmets from the same period - a type known as a ‘Negau helmet’ — are not always Greek-like; in particular many of them are open-faced (or if they had face protection it was made something other than leather.

The most extreme version was quite vertical indeed:

_Interestingly, this type was common all the way from Etruria into central Europe. Image:_ _[British Museum](https://britishmuseum.withgoogle.com/object/bronze-crested-helmet)_ 

The familiar Roman ‘pot’ helmet would not come along for another century and a half — it was a derivation from Gallic designs in northern Italy.

Besides the makhaira type, other swords of this period also resemble Greek models, being leaf shaped. The legionary gladius would still be well in the future: the Romans adopted that from their enemies in Spain during the Punic Wars.

For an good general guide, [Early Roman Warriors 753–321 BC by Nic Fields](https://amzn.to/2ZAyoYK) is well researched and illustrated
