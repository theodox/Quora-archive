The manuscript history of Livy is quite complex, because his work was so huge that our modern editions are all built on fragments. The overwhelming majority of what he wrote is lost — more than 100 of the original 142 volumes have vanished, and not all of the rest is intact.

Still — pretty remarkably for an ancient manuscript — some of our surviving text can be traced directly to a fifth century originals. This is not to say we have complete books from that far back (that’s _incredibly_ rare) but we do have fragments which provide a very old check on our current text.

__Fragments__ 

There are in fact quite a few bits and pieces of Livy on from the 4th or 5th century:

[MS. Lat. Clas. f5 ](https://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/catalog/manuscript_6412)from the Bodleian Library, also known as P. Oxy XI 1379 - a tiny fourth century fragment of the Book I.

[PSI XI 1291](http://www.psi-online.it/documents/psi;12;1291) is a fourth century sliver of a condensed version of books XLVII-XLVIII (pictured below) . Another fragment of what’s probably the same artifact is in the British Library as British Library Papyrus 1532 (not online).

A couple of lines from a fifth century copy of book XI, found in the Coptic monastery at Naqlun, known as [PNaqlun Inv. 15/86](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3556494) (paywalled — but the contents [here](http://www.attalus.org/latin/liv_fr.html) as 1a and 1b)

None of these very old texts is large or easily readable on its own, but they reflect the popularity of Livy in the middle Empire — and the first one illustrates the stability of the text we have, at least for book I. It’s _extremely_ uncommon to have so many fragments from before the fifth or sixth century (for comparison, the oldest surviving text of Caesar’s _De Bello Gallico_  is from the 9th century).

__Books I to X__ 

The splendidly named [Bibliothecae Capitularis Veronensis xl](http://bibliotecacapitolare.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-Codici-letter-latina.pdf) (not digitized, alas) is a palimpsest, that is, it was overwritten: on the surface it’s an eighth century copy of the _Moralia_ of Pope Gregory, but this was written on the scraped pages of a fourth or fifth century codex containing books III through VI. Most of our modern text of the first 10 books, however, derives from an edition that was done for the arch-conservative Roman aristocrat [Symmachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Aurelius_Symmachus) around the same time as the Veronensis — we don’t have Symmachus’ originals but the results of his sponsorship are visible in several medieval manuscripts, notably an amazing 10th century copy from the Laurentian library in Florence, [Ms Plutei 63.19](http://mss.bmlonline.it/s.aspx?Id=AWOIt5ljI1A4r7GxMMXZ&c=T.%20Livius#/book)

_The beginning of book one from the Plutei 63.19 manuscript (the red title, without its Ottonian-era abbreviations, announces TITI LIVII HISTORIARUM AB URBE CONDITA LIBER I INCIPIT, “the histories of Titus Livius from the founding of the city, book I begins”_ 

There are quite a few good 9th and 10th century manuscripts of Livy’s first ten books (few entirely complete, but overlapping) which helps establish this part of the text quite well.

One thing this shows is that Livy’s works were prized: not only are the quite a few manuscripts, we can also see some of them in the libraries of famous people: for example, the 10th century [MS Harley 2672](http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=7372&CollID=8&NStart=2672) once belonged to the medieval theologian [Nicholas of Cusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_of_Cusa). A 12th century copy, [MS Harley 2493 ](http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Harley_MS_2493)and has marginal notes from the [Petrarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch), whose edition of Livy helped kick-start the Renaissance, and also from the formidable 15th century scholar [Lorenzo Valla](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lorenzo-valla/).

__Books XX-XXIX__ 

The key manuscript here is known as the [Puteanus, or BnF Lat 5730](https://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc64709p) (you can see digitized versions of this and several other manuscripts of Livy [here](http://monumenta.ch/latein/xanfang.php?n=31)) . The Puteanus was written in Italy probably in the fifth century and probably ended up in the court library of Charlemagne (again — Livy was popular). It’s not the best text but it is lovely artifact, and it was the basis for many subsequent copies — for example [Codex Regius Latinus 762 ](https://digi.vatlib.it/mss/detail/Reg.lat.762)in the currently in Vatican which was directly copied from it by a team of eight scribes around the year 800 in Tours.

__Books XXX-XXXIX__ 

The oldest surviving piece of this part of Livy is a fragmentary text of book XXXIV, known as [Vaticanus Latinus 10696](https://digi.vatlib.it/mss/detail/137340). This is quite the find - a fragment of a fourth or fifth century codex that was used to line a box of relics from the Holy Land sometime around 800 and only rediscovered in 1906.

Our main source for these books is an 11th century volume in the Staatsbiblothek Bamberg, [MS Class 35](https://zendsbb.digitale-sammlungen.de/db/0000/sbb00000098/images/). We have some [pathetic remnants of the 5th century original](https://zendsbb.digitale-sammlungen.de/db/0000/sbb00000099/images/), just enough to help us see that the later text came from the same tradition.

Books XL-XLV

There’s only one major source for this section is a fifth century manuscript in the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Codex Vidonboniensis Latinus 15

> _note: unfortunately at the time of writing, the Austrian National Library site is down, at least for me — I’ll try to add a link if there’s a digitized version later_ 

This is not a great text, but it’s all we have. It’s been suggested that this might have actually come from the library of [Alcuin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin), the leading light of Carolingian scholarship.



This over-long answer is already a vast oversimplification of the complex textural tradition of Livy. As both a source for ancient history and an example of Latin prose, he was a popular author in the book-starved Middle Ages. Here I’ve only picked out the key manuscripts and not the hundreds of later, or lesser ones floating around in the monasteries and courts of the 8th-13th centuries.

At the same time, of course, we only retain a fraction of Livy’s work — just over a quarter of the complete 142 volumes. The critical bottleneck must have come in the troubled times of the sixth to the eight centuries, when literacy was in retreat and copying over a hundred volumes was an impossibly expensive task. Our surviving texts cover two more or less coherent stories: the earliest days of Roman expansion and the Second Punic War. It may be that some ancient librarians or scholars made the fateful choice to rescue only select parts of his work and jettison the later portions which overlapped with other, relatively well known Latin sources — Caesar, Cicero, and Sallust.

__Afterword__ 

It’s worth pointing out that there was also the “Reader’s Digest” version of Livy, the [Periochae](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/livy/livy-the-periochae/) or “Summaries” which give us at least a brief idea of what we are missing in the many lost books. These summaries were already circulating in the third or fourth century.

There was also the _[Epitome de T. Livio Bellorum omnium annorum DCC Libri du](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/florus/epitome/home.html)_ _o_ (“Abridgement in two books of all the wars of 700 years of T. Livius”) by first century historian Lucius Annaeus Florus, which is mostly based on Livy.

Both the _Periochae_ and the _Epitome_ have their own, fairly complex, manuscript history — a bit much to get into here.
