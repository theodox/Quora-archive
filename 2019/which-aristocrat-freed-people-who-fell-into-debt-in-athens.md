The most famous one is [Solon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon).

His signature reform was called the [Seisachtheia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seisachtheia), “the shaking off of burdens” (or maybe “of fetters”) in Athens in 594 or 593 BC. The details of the program are not clearly understood — even in antiquity some people said Solon had wiped debts clean entirely, and others that he had devalued the currency to make debts payable at a discount. It’s not clear that his reforms distinguished between “debt bondage” — the voluntary use of your own person as collateral for a loan — and enslavement for debt, that is, forced repayment of a bad loan by labor.

Solon’s reforms were always described in antiquity as finding a middle ground between the aristocrats, who hated the idea of losing the money they had already loaned out, and the common people who were demanding a complete redistribution of land. The Seisachteia was enough of a success that the Athenians entrusted Solon with a further reform of their constitution a couple of years later. His moderate policy preserved some forms of aristocratic privilege but also gave commoners representation in the new government, forming the first toehold of what would become Athenian democracy about 75 years later.

The most complete ancient source is [Plutarch’s Life of Solon](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Solon*.html).
