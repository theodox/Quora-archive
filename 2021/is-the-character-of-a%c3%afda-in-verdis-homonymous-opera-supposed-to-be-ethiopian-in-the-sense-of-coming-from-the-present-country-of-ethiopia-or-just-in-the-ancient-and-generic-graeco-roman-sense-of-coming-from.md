# Is the character of Aïda in Verdi's homonymous opera supposed to be Ethiopian in the sense of "coming from the present country of Ethiopia", or just in the ancient and generic Graeco-Roman sense of "coming from somewhere south of Egypt", like Nubia?

Aïda is a Nubian; she’s Ethiopian in the Greek sense of the word, that is, “darker skinned people living south of Egypt.”

Verdi’s librettist was working off a treatment by [Mariette Bey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Mariette), the French director of the Egyptian antiquities department. Among other things, he handled artifacts from the Sudan, and was familiar with the ups and downs of Egyptian-Nubian relations from his knowledge of Egyptian inscriptions . In many ways it was the gradual discovery of the nature of relations back and forth across the first cataract that set the stage for Aïda.

Amonasro, of course, has a name derived from Amun — recognition of the role of the great temple of Amun at Gebel Barkal, some of whose artifacts had passed through Mariette’s hands in Cairo. Mariette was also familiar with the Nubian pharaohs of the 25th dynasty, but, following 19th century convention, always described them as “Ethiopian.”

_A page from the English translation of Mariette Bey’s “_ _[Monuments of Upper Egypt](http://mc.dlib.nyu.edu/files/books/ifa_egypt000231/ifa_egypt000231_lo.pdf)_ _”_ 

In any case, the “Ethiopian” invasion in the opera is aimed at Thebes, the traditional target of armies coming down the Nile, and it’s clear that they are coming across the border:

> Dai confin d’Etiopia un messaggero
Dianzi giungea: gravi novelle ei reca.

> A messenger has just arrived from the border
of Ethiopia. He brings grave news
