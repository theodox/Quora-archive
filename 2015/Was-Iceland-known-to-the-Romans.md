Maybe. 

It depends on whether or not you assign the Greek name [Thule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule) to Iceland, to Norway, or to 'somewhere out there'. The attribution to Iceland is believed to come from the Greek geographer [Pytheas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pytheas) but we only have it indirectly -- and Strabo (our main source for the Roman view of this) regarded Pytheas as very untrustworthy --- though in this case it seems like Pytheas may have been right. In Latin literature _ultima Thule_ , 'outermost Thule', is a hand-wavey synonym for 'the edge of the known world'.
