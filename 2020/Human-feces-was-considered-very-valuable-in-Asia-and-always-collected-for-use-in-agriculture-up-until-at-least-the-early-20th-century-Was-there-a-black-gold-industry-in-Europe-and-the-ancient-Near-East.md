# Human feces was considered very valuable in Asia and always collected for use in agriculture, up until at least the early 20th century. Was there a "black gold," industry in Europe and the ancient Near East?

It was big business in Rome — in fact, the manure industry had its own patron god, [Sterculius](https://pantheon.org/articles/s/sterculius.html), whose name derives from _[stercus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=stercus)_ _,_ which means exactly what you’d expect. Alas, there do not appear to be any existing images of this important deity — one can only wonder why.

Roman agriculture preferred, where possible, to rely on avian excrement — particularly from pigeons, which were a common domestic bird. They generally ranked manures by what we’d call the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio: you get a lot more nitrogen for a given volume of pigeon droppings than you do for people-manure. Human leavings were regarded as pretty good, so long as they were mixed up with enough other material: the Roman agricultural writer [Columella ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0845.phi002.perseus-lat1:2.15.2)worried that the human matter “burns up the ground,” because it’s too “hot” — an unscientific way of warning about the over-manuring. However he still preferred it to cow or pig dung as long as it was mixed with enough compostable material to keep the nitrogen burns in check.

In urban areas, the business was important enough that _plaustra exportandaei stercoris, “_ wagons for the carrying away of manure,” were among the few exceptions to the laws which banned wheeled vehicle traffic during the daytime. Despite the existence of public latrines, very few houses had private sewer service — and since most Roman cities were pretty dicey after dark, the Romans had a thriving chamber-pot business.

The Romans called an irritating acquaintance a _mus in matella_ , a “mouse in the chamber pot.” In Pompeii, at least, where the underlying earth was mostly porous volcanic material most houses had a latrine dug into their courtyards — these probably acted as composting toilets, being periodically cleaned out by the Roman equivalent of a septic tank cleaner. Although Roman law allowed private homes to connect to the city sewer system, running water toilets were very rare — so rare, in fact, that one could suppose that resale of manure was a meaningful source of income not to simply be flushed away. On the other hand the Romans may simply have been indifferent to the consequences of having a latrine in their back yards: this might account for their [obsessive interest in perfumes, unguents and incense.](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-Roman-thing-ever/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=30ac9386&srid=zLvM)

Urine was also commonly used in agriculture: Columella said nothing was better for fruit trees or vines and that properly applied urine did wonders for both the productivity and taste of apples and grapes.

Independent of agriculture, urine was also a valuable source of industrial chemicals in Roman times. If you go to Pompeii or Ostia you can visit the remains of Romen [fullonicae](https://www.ostia-foundation.org/the-whitest-whites-fullonicae-at-ostia-and-pompeii/), the ancient equivalent of dry cleaners’ shops — these doubled as public restrooms, collecting “donations” from passersby which were fermented to make the cleaning solution. It’s usually said that [emperor Vespasian raised taxes on public restrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecunia_non_olet) — in fact, he just raised the price of the urine which the state resold to fullers, tanners and other people who needed a highly alkaline liquid for chemical processes.
