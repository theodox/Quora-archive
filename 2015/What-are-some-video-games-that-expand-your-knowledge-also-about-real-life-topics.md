Civilization has probably done more to spread knowledge of ceremonial burial than all the anthropologists who ever lived :)

In somewhat related way, Sim City does a great job of teaching people about the nonlinear and often perverse behavior of complex dynamic systems. Should be required playing for all would-be politicians. 

 In the town where I went to school, a high school kid somehow conned the mayoral candidates into playing Sim City for a campaign stunt. One candidate demonstrated complete inability to manage a keyboard and a mouse. One built police and fire stations every two blocks and was bankrupt in half an hour. One actually read the manual the night before and played a halfway decent game. He also won the election. [Only a Game? : Will your town thrive or perish? The fate of millions is in your hands. Or so it seems. It's your turn in SimCity.](http://articles.latimes.com/print/1992-10-02/news/vw-391_1_electronic-game)

Unfortunately he completed his term in jail for corruption, so I'm not sure it's quite the uplifting story I was angling for. But still...
