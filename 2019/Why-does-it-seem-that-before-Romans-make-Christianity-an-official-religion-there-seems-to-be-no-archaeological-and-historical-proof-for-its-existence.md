# Why does it seem that before Romans make Christianity an official religion, there seems to be no archaeological and historical proof for its existence?

It seems that way primarily to people who ignore evidence they find inconvenient. There is abundant historical and archaeological data to examine. It’s easy to review it and not accept the supernatural claims of Christianity — but the idea that the secular history of early Christianity is a whole-cloth invention is just untenable.

__History__ 

The earliest outside mention is usually said to be the passage in the [Annals of Tacitus ](http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/annals.11.xv.html)about the aftermath of the [Great Fire of Rome in 64.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_Rome)

> all human efforts, all the lavish gifts of the emperor, and the propitiations of the gods, did not banish the sinister belief that the conflagration was the result of an order. Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.

XV.44

This is written shortly after the year 100, recalling the events of the author’s own boyhood.

From the same period, the [private letters of Pliny the Younger](https://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/pliny.html) contain this, probably from the year 111:

> __Pliny to the Emperor Trajan__ 

> It is my practice, my lord, to refer to you all matters concerning which I am in doubt. For who can better give guidance to my hesitation or inform my ignorance? I have never participated in trials of Christians. I therefore do not know what offenses it is the practice to punish or investigate, and to what extent. And I have been not a little hesitant as to whether there should be any distinction on account of age or no difference between the very young and the more mature; whether pardon is to be granted for repentance, or, if a man has once been a Christian, it does him no good to have ceased to be one; whether the name itself, even without offenses, or only the offenses associated with the name are to be punished.

> Meanwhile, in the case of those who were denounced to me as Christians, I have observed the following procedure: I interrogated these as to whether they were Christians; those who confessed I interrogated a second and a third time, threatening them with punishment; those who persisted I ordered executed. For I had no doubt that, whatever the nature of their creed, stubbornness and inflexible obstinacy surely deserve to be punished. There were others possessed of the same folly; but because they were Roman citizens, I signed an order for them to be transferred to Rome.

> Soon accusations spread, as usually happens, because of the proceedings going on, and several incidents occurred. An anonymous document was published containing the names of many persons. Those who denied that they were or had been Christians, when they invoked the gods in words dictated by me, offered prayer with incense and wine to your image, which I had ordered to be brought for this purpose together with statues of the gods, and moreover cursed Christ--none of which those who are really Christians, it is said, can be forced to do--these I thought should be discharged. Others named by the informer declared that they were Christians, but then denied it, asserting that they had been but had ceased to be, some three years before, others many years, some as much as twenty-five years. They all worshipped your image and the statues of the gods, and cursed Christ.

> They asserted, however, that the sum and substance of their fault or error had been that they were accustomed to meet on a fixed day before dawn and sing responsively a hymn to Christ as to a god, and to bind themselves by oath, not to some crime, but not to commit fraud, theft, or adultery, not falsify their trust, nor to refuse to return a trust when called upon to do so. When this was over, it was their custom to depart and to assemble again to partake of food--but ordinary and innocent food. Even this, they affirmed, they had ceased to do after my edict by which, in accordance with your instructions, I had forbidden political associations. Accordingly, I judged it all the more necessary to find out what the truth was by torturing two female slaves who were called deaconesses. But I discovered nothing else but depraved, excessive superstition.

> I therefore postponed the investigation and hastened to consult you. For the matter seemed to me to warrant consulting you, especially because of the number involved. For many persons of every age, every rank, and also of both sexes are and will be endangered. For the contagion of this superstition has spread not only to the cities but also to the villages and farms. But it seems possible to check and cure it. It is certainly quite clear that the temples, which had been almost deserted, have begun to be frequented, that the established religious rites, long neglected, are being resumed, and that from everywhere sacrificial animals are coming, for which until now very few purchasers could be found. Hence it is easy to imagine what a multitude of people can be reformed if an opportunity for repentance is afforded.

> __Trajan to Pliny__ 

> You observed proper procedure, my dear Pliny, in sifting the cases of those who had been denounced to you as Christians. For it is not possible to lay down any general rule to serve as a kind of fixed standard. They are not to be sought out; if they are denounced and proved guilty, they are to be punished, with this reservation, that whoever denies that he is a Christian and really proves it--that is, by worshiping our gods--even though he was under suspicion in the past, shall obtain pardon through repentance. But anonymously posted accusations ought to have no place in any prosecution. For this is both a dangerous kind of precedent and out of keeping with the spirit of our age.

For a non-Roman point of view, there’s the Syrian author Lucian of Samosata, writing in Greek sometime between about 150 and 180. His _[The Death of Peregrinus](http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/lucian/peregrinus.htm)_ __ is devoted to lampooning a contemporary philosopher who fell for a variety of intellectual fads — including, for a while, Christianity:

> It was then that he learned the wondrous lore of the Christians, by associating with their priests and scribes in Palestine. And—how else could it be?—in a trice he made them all look like children, for he was prophet, cult-leader, head of the synagogue, and everything, all by himself. He interpreted and explained some of their books and even composed many, and they revered him as a god, made use of him as a lawgiver, and set him down as a protector, next after that other, to be sure, whom they still worship, the man who was crucified in Palestine because he introduced this new cult into the world.

XI

Part of the satire, for Lucian, is how Peregrinus bilked his co-religionists before moving on to a new fad:

> if any charlatan and trickster, able to profit by occasions, comes among them, he quickly acquires sudden wealth by imposing upon these simple folk.

These aren’t the only references; they’re just a selection of well known ones that clearly don’t portray early Christians in a supernatural or even particularly flattering light.

Some readers will point out that the oldest manuscripts for these are hundreds of years later than the events they portray. That’s quite true — but of course the situation is no different for any other work of ancient literature. Manuscripts older than about the ninth century are incredibly rare: if you want to throw out these particular passages on the grounds of continuity, [you’ll have to throw out the rest of ancient history with it](https://www.quora.com/A-Quoran-archaeologist-historian-argues-there-is-no-textual-evidence-for-a-Christian-theological-tradition-in-the-West-prior-to-the-life-of-Alcuin-735-804-CE-and-that-earlier-Christian-history-is-a-fiction-Is-there/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=f82d439c&srid=zLvM). The oldest continuous manuscripts of anything in Latin or Greek come from the fifth century or so; before that time we have only bits and pieces, typically leaves of papyrus that have survived in the Egyptian desert.

In any case if you’re hung up on manuscript tradition, there’s [Rylands Library Papyrus P52](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rylands_Library_Papyrus_P52), which is a tiny sliver of the Gospel of John. It’s dated to sometime in the second century, more than a hundred years before Christianity was legalized.

The fallback argument would be that references above were inserted by copyists — presumably, scheming medieval monks — during the long gap between the original time frame and the oldest surviving copies. Ancient books were, of course, copied by hand and there are certainly cases of forgery and interpolation. However these interpolations are usually fairly obvious and easy to catch because they address an ideological or political aim that the copyist wants to advance: the most famous example (which was detected as a forgery as long ago as the 1400’s) is the supposed [Donation of Constantine](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05118a.htm), which purported to be Constantine’s gift of temporal power to the Popes.

That kind of forgery however makes no sense in any of the passages cited here, which are neither complementary nor sympathetic to Christians. They match the language of the surrounding text, they don’t contain miracle stories or “proof of prophecy,” and they don’t serve the political aims of some medieval potentate. The only thing they have in common is mentioning an unpopular social group.

Lastly — though this is the kind of evidence that a radical skeptic will simply ignore without reading any of it — there’s the [original literature of the early church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patristics). There’s a lot of material about the organization, development, and the many forms of infighting of early Christianity. The English-language edition of the [Ante-Nicene Fathers](https://www.biblestudytools.com/history/early-church-fathers/ante-nicene/), which collects only works dated before 325, runs to 9 volumes including works from Latin, Greek, Syriac and Coptic.

That literature, too, is sometimes hand-waved away as some kind of later forgery. Personally, I find it vastly improbable that somebody with the gall to invent an entire religion out of thin air would bother to forge such a sprawling and often embarrassing record of squabbles, personality conflicts, and internal politics. Medieval monks certainly produced a lot of miracle-laden guff; but they did not generally have the language skills or historical reference material they would have needed to invent the social and political history we actually see: they would have invented something much simpler, cleaner and more satisfying.

__Archaeology__ 

As for “no archaeological evidence”, one has to ask what counts. There is abundant physical evidence going back at least to the second century.

Until Christianity was legalized, most church communities met in secret (you can see this quite clearly in Pliny’s letter, above). The biggest archaeological ‘footprint’ therefore is literally underground, in the form of the extensive underground burial grounds known as [catacombs](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_commissions/archeo/inglese/documents/rc_com_archeo_doc_20011010_cataccrist_en.html). These starting in the mid second century — so a century and more before the legalization of Christianity above ground — these burial grounds are the earliest examples of Christian art and inscriptions. In Rome alone there are almost 600 acres of Christian catacombs, but they are found in other parts of Italy, Sicily, Sardinia and North Africa.

And — while we’re considering “lack of archaeological evidence” it might be a good idea to take a stroll through the Vatican’s Pius Christian Museum, which houses a large collection of artifacts (mostly sarcophagi and tomb inscriptions) from the third through the fifth centuries.

There are also a couple of examples of above-ground Christian archaeology from the period before legalization. The most famous is the [Dura-Europos church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura-Europos_church), from a Roman frontier town on the border with Persia. It’s not exactly what the name implies, because it was technically a private residence rather than a public building; but it it’s clearly a place of worship decorated with scenes from the New Testament (Dura also housed a very interesting synagogue at the same time). We know that the Dura church existed before the middle of the third century (a hundred years or so before Constantine) because Dura was abandoned after its capture by the Persians around 256.

Another (rare) example of a semi-public place of worship is the [Megiddo church ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megiddo_church_(Israel))in Israel, which was only discovered in 2005. It dates to some time in the late third or early fourth century.

Outside of the monumental there are some other pieces of evidence to consider. From what you might call the “other side” of this question is the second century [Alexamenos graffito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexamenos_graffito), which seems to have been a piece of schoolboy humor.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-82ef3ed152f07a332fa45e8e7844146d)

The poorly spelled Greek says roughly “Alexamenos, worship God!” It shows someone — presumably Alexamenos — with a hand raised salute to a crucified figure with the head of a donkey. It transplants an old Roman anti-semitic trope, that Jews worshipped a donkey’s head, onto the equally scandalous idea of worshipping someone who had been crucified.

Lastly, there’s also evidence for the existence of Christian communities outside the Roman empire. If the idea is that the Christian tradition was simply imposed by imperial fiat, it’s rather difficult to explain this — a coin from the empire of Axum (more or less the ancestor of modern Ethiopia) which adopted Christianity as a state religion about a generation before Rome did.

Traditionally, the client-kingdom of [Osroene ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osroene#In_Roman_sources)is said to have adopted Christianity under [Abgar IX ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abgar_IX)in the early 200’s. Meanwhile the oldest cathedral in the world — dating to the years 302–3, still ten years before Christianity was officially made legal for Romans — is the [Etchmiadzin Cathedral](https://www.ancient.eu/Etchmiadzin_Cathedral/) in Armenia. The contemporary structure dates from the 450’s but remnants of the original were found during repair work in the 50’s.
