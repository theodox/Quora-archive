No. Roman traders operated as far east as the Bay of Bengal, and some of them went up through Burma to Yunnan, but they never had regular direct relations — it was very episodic. On at least, one occasion Roman “envoys” made it to the Chinese court - but the Chinese record notes with a sniff that their gifts were unimpressive and consisted mostly of good for sale in Java and Burma — not the good stuff (particularly gold, gems and glass) that the Chinese wanted from the west. This was probably a Roman entrepreneur overplaying his credentials, not a formal diplomatic mission from Rome. On the other hand, the Romans definitely did take an active interest in facilitating trade that bypassed the Parthian empire (which sat on the later Silk Road between them and China), so they were willing. However, the distances were astronomical by ancient standards.

The Romans were aware of the existence of China, which they tended to refer to as two different places; [Serica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serica), which seems to have been northern China and Manchuria, and the land of the [Sinae ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sinae)— which would be southern China and is related to our word “China”. Sinae was reached by sea and thence by river.

As you can see, this version of a Roman-era map (in Renaissance recreation) only extends as far east as Burma and Bangladesh - beyond that it’s basically blank. There’s good evidence that Roman traders operated directly as far as [Oc Eo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93c_Eo) in Vietnam, which they knew as Cattigara — but that is the outer limit.

Interestingly, [Late Roman coins have been found in Okinawa](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/28/495821834/coins-from-the-roman-empire-are-found-in-ruins-of-japanese-castle). However like most ancient coins their value was in weight-of-precious metal and they often circulated as commodities well beyond the range of regular economic contacts.
