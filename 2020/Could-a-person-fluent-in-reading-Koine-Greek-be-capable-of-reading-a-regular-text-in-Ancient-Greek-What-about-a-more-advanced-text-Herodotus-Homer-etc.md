# Could a person fluent in reading Koine Greek be capable of reading a regular text in Ancient Greek? What about a more advanced text (Herodotus, Homer, etc.)?

Koine will get you much of Classical — for most of us moderns the key hurdles to any ancient Greek are grammar and orthography, both of which are fairly similar in Koine and earlier Greek. In a hand-wavey analogy, the ability to read mid-century American prose like Nabokov or Hemingway will get you most of the way to reading Ben Jonson and Shakespeare; the basic forms will be there but you’ll miss a lot of special purpose vocabulary and be misled by a few false friends.

If you learned Koine first you’re more likely to get hung up on dialectical issues. Koine tends to be fairly similar to Attic, so you’ll be able to follow Demosthenes or Plato or Xenophon.* However pre-classical authors with strong dialect will be harder: Herodotus’s and Hesiod’s Ionic will send you to the dictionary a lot, and Homer will definitely be extra work; to extend the Hemingway analogy, Hesiod and Herodotus are like Robert Burns and Homer is like Chaucer. Which is to say it’s far from impossible but it’s going to be work — if you’re reasonably conversant with the New Testament or Plutarch or something along those lines you’ll feel like you’ve dropped a couple of grades in school. It’s far from impossible, but there will be an extra quantum of difficulty once you try to get from “decoding” to “reading.”

The other bit — the one that has always eluded me — will be poetry; I have a tin ear for metre to begin with and the rules only get more complex once you get things like Doric vs Ionic vowels making things even murkier. Since Koine learners tend to pick up the language through NT or historical prose, rather than verse, this is often an unexpected bit of extra work. Thus the tragedians, and folks like Sappho and Pindar will take some elbow grease to really appreciate.



*Not Thucydides — nobody can read Thucydides once he gets into abstractions. He’s like the Greek Heidegger.
