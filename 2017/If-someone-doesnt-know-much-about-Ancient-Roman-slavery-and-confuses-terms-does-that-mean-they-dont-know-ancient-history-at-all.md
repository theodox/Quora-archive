# If someone doesn’t know much about Ancient Roman slavery and confuses terms does that mean they don't know ancient history at all?

Not necessarily — ancient history, after all, covers a lot of territory in both space and time.

In academic circles, the pros will tend to get huffy if people start straying too far outside their academic niches: if you’re an expert on Greek Hellenistic diplomacy and you make a strong statement about early treaties between Rome and Carthage you’re probably going to earn a few snippy footnotes from somebody who specializes in the early Roman Republic.

For ordinary mortals, it’s quite possible to be very well informed in a spotty manner — in fact, if you’re an amateur it’s quite likely your knowledge is very unevenly distributed because of your reading habits.

Nobody knows everything.
