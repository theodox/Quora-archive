# It seems like most of what we know about Achaemenid Persia comes from ancient Greek records. Why are the Persians' own records so sparse?

We generally tend to assume a monotonic scale of ‘development’ in which societies ‘progress’ along some relatively predictable series of stage like players in a game of _Civilization._ “What’s next on the tech tree? Oh Ceremonial Burial! Bring on those social cohesion bonuses”

Unfortunately it’s a model that’s very convenient and familiar and not, in fact, very accurate at all. The administration of the Persian empire is a good example of how ‘common sense’ ideas about literacy and sophistication don’t actually work in practice.

To simplify things a bit,__the Achaemenid empire was basically illiterate__ ___in Persian,___ __ even though the Persians ruled over a number of literate societies — Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, Ionia, Lydia, and Egypt to name a few. A Persian king had no problem keeping track of things or communicating his will to people all over his vast domains; _he just didn’t do it in Persian_ .

The most characteristic document of the Achaemenid empire is the hodgepodge of tablets we call the [Persepolis Fortification Archive](https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/projects/persepolis-fortification-archive), a collection of administrative writings found in the ruins of Persepolis, covering all sorts of mundane details about how workers on royal projects in the region were recruited, clothed, housed and fed. It’s a big cache of documents — it probably comprised 15,000 to 18,000 documents — but so far we’ve found __only one tablet__ written in Persian cuneiform. For comparison purposes there are pieces of about 10,000 documents in Elamite, more than 1000 in Aramaic, and another 5,000 or so that appear to contain only seal impressions (ie, “signatures” from various officials). There are a handful of other documents — one in Greek, one in Phrygian, and one in Babylonian cuneiform — but clearly the empire as an institution was administered primarily in Elamite and Aramaic rather than in Persian.

This is borne out by finds as far afield as Bactria in the east and Egypt in the west — pretty much wherever we find the workings of the Persian state, they are recorded in a language other than Persian.

You could imagine this was some kind of government foible — like the retention of Latin for official purposes a thousand years after the end of the Roman empire in the west. However it was probably something more than that. Consider the famous [Kanadahar inscription of Ashoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_Bilingual_Rock_Inscription):

This was put up by the Indian emperor Ashoka in the tenth year of his reign (260 BC) in Kandahar, aka [Alexandria Arachosia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Arachosia) — a city which was founded by Alexander the Great during his eastern adventures sixty years before. That would explain the Greek text — but the city (not an Achaemenid center: Alexander founded it) clearly had a significant population of Aramaic readers even though it was 2,000 miles from the Aramaic-language heartland of Syria. Clearly a lot of these people were able to function in Aramaic for business or political reasons, whatever language they spoke at home. So, it seems clear that __many inhabitants of the Persian empire were functionally multilingual — and that they conducted a great deal of their practical affairs in languages other than Persian.__ 

To us in the 21st century this should not come as a shock. Our world runs on second languages, from English to Arabic to Russian. Many of those second-language speakers conduct large swathes of their lives to their second language — for example many of my colleagues in the video games business use English for work despite living and working in Europe because it’s often easier build a team and to access technical resources and industry chatter in English than in their native languages. If 99% of all written evidence for their workplaces were to disappear (much as 99% of all written material from antiquity has disappeared) it would be easy for future historians to conclude that there was no German or Polish or Italian games industry because the few hard-drives that were dug up from the ruins would be full of English text.

__So — the primary reason we don’t really see the Persian perspective in Achaemenid era documents is that Persian didn’t develop a significant written literature during that era.__ If Persians wanted something written down, they did it in another language.

There did exist a written form of Achaemenid Persian, based on a simplified version of cuneiform. However, outside of that one document from Persepolis, it appears only in a handful of royal inscriptions. This choice of writing technology probably retarded the growth of literacy in Persian: cuneiform is a difficult writing system which tended to be left in the hands of highly trained scribes. As a new artificial version of cuneiform, written Old Persian must have been particularly hard to teach and it does not seem to have caught on. [There are just over two dozen identified texts in Persian Cuneiform, and many of those are only a line or two.](http://www.avesta.org/op/op.htm)

Thus to get even fragments of the Achaemenid world view we have to rely on Persian subjects who wrote in other languages. It’s often important to remember how “Persian” some familiar texts really are; for example[ the story in Herodotus about how a Magian imposter usurped the throne of Persia by pretending to be the second son of Cyrus sounds like some kind of fairytale,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardiya) the kind of thing Herodotus’ many critics would regard as suspect — but in fact it’s a somewhat embroidered version of what Darius wrote about the same episode in his inscription at Behistun (a fact lost to history until the inscription was rediscovered and translated in the 19th century). The imitation son of Cyrus may, of course, be an invention of Darius’ own propaganda — but it’s absolutely the Achaemenid perspective embodied in a Greek voice (a Greek in Persian employ, [Ctesias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesias), tells another variant of the same story). Greek, Jewish, Aramaic and Mesopotamian literature in this period all reflect Persian concerns, though of course we have a hard time sifting through the different cross-currents and agendas to get at the uniquely Persian elements. You want to hear from a Persian governor in his own words? Read the [Book of Nehemiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Nehemiah#:~:text=The%20Book%20of%20Nehemiah%2C%20in,to%20God's%20laws%20(Torah).) in the Bible: it’s the longest first person text by a Persian official.

Persian did, of course. eventually find its stride as a literate language. Aramaic, being alphabetic, was much easier to teach — that probably helps explain why Persian subjects from Elephantine on the Nile to Kandahar used it for their private affairs. During the Parthian era, the Aramaic alphabet was adapted to create [Pahlavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pahlavi_scripts), the first writing system for which we have Persian language literature outside the context of government. But that would be many centuries after the fall of the Achaemenids, and [by that time the lack of Persian-language historical sources meant that there was already considerable haziness about the nature of the Achaemenid period among Persians themselves.](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Sasanians-know-about-the-Achaemenid-empire-If-so-what-was-their-view-on-it/answer/Steve-Theodore)
