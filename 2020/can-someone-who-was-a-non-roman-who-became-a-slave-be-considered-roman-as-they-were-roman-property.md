Any Roman slave who was manumitted would get a sort of intermediate status as a _[libertus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Libertus.html)_ _,_ a freedman. They’d have the same property rights and civil rights as Roman citizens, though they were ineligible for elective public office or inclusion in the Senate, even if they could afford the astronomical property qualification.* The children of _liberti_ were full Roman citizens.

While remaining as slave, on the other hand, the slave had no[ legal rights of any kind](https://www.quora.com/Could-Romans-do-whatever-they-want-with-their-slaves/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=e5d83736&srid=zLvM) — their only real protection was the informal limits on the masters’ behavior.

Manumission was [fairly common](https://ancientimes.blogspot.com/2016/03/roman-slavery-and-rate-of-manumission.html), though hard to quantify. Some estimates suggest that the majority of slaves would be freed during their lifetimes; others put it around half. However our data is not great so the number could also be lower.



* This is a slight simplification. If you were under 30 when manumitted you received “Latin rights,” — essentially, civil rights without political rights. And people who’d been condemned to slavery for a criminal offence or who had been an active enemy on the battlefield did not receive those benefits — they could not have full rights even if manumitted.
