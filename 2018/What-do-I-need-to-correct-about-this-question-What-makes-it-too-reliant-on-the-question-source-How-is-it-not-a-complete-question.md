# What do I need to correct about this question? What makes it too reliant on the question source? How is it not a complete question?

Those suggestions are auto-generated, they’re unlikely to be made by a human. I suspect in this case the bots are reacting to the the grammar of the question title:

__What are the pros and cons of lifting with vertical thrusters, as the Moon Bus in "2001" was depicted to do, versus ballistically hopping to a destination?__ 

Perhaps if you rephrased it to something like

__Why would a space vehicle (like the Moon Bus in “2001”) use vertical thrusters, instead of ballistically hopping to a destination?__ 

the bots will be kinder. My (completely uneducated) guess is that verb clause “was depicted to do” is what’s throwing the bots off.

It’s also possible that the image-only link is confusing the bots; maybe a link to a page with a description of the Moon bus as well as the image will help.
