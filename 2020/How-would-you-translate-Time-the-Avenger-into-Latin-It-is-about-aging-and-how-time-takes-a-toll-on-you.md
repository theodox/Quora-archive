# How would you translate “Time the Avenger” into Latin? It is about aging and how time takes a toll on you.

_tempus ultor_  is the easy way; or if you want to go a more mythological route _Saturnus ultor_ invokes [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(mythology)). He was the god of time — a Roman fertility god who got sort of retconned into the Greek [Kronos ](https://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanKronos.html)and in the process came to personify both the passage of time and the endless cycle of birth, dissolution, and rebirth that marks the agricultural cycle. Saturn is ultimately beneficent (unlike Kronos, who was kind of a jerk).

A slightly more “Roman” way to say it would be _senectus ultrix;_  Senectus was “old age”, and because the Romans loved to personify things the word became the name of a minor Goddess; thus in the Aeneid:

> In the first courts and entrances of Hell
Sorrows and vengeful Cares on couches lie :
There sad Old Age abides, Diseases pale,
And Fear, and Hunger, temptress to all crime;
Want, base and vile, and, two dread shapes to see,
Bondage and Death : then Sleep, Death's next of kin;
And dreams of guilty joy. Death-dealing War
Is ever at the doors, and hard thereby
The Furies' beds of steel, where wild-eyed Strife
Her snaky hair with blood-stained fillet binds.
