The two great interpreters of Sumerian and early Mesopotamian culture are [Samuel Noah Kramer](https://amzn.to/32mHZA1) and [Thorkild Jacobsen](https://amzn.to/2WUUX6V). They make a good pair because, despite being contemporaries they offer very different ways of looking at Sumerian culture. Kramer’s [Sumerian Mythology](https://amzn.to/2WRi4zo) and Jacobsen’s [The Treasures of Darkness](https://amzn.to/36HAVRT) are both great in very different ways.
