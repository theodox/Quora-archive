Battlefront deserves high marks for pushing outdoor environments in particular very far. I've been working in shooters for almost 20 years and so far I've never seen anything that competes with the forest level in this year's Battlefront (except, perhaps for some of the settings in _[The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Redux](http://www.theastronauts.com/2015/09/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-redux-out-now/)_ _._

_I'm pretty tough to please. But I'm impressed._ 

It's probably not a coincidence. Both games make very extensive use of [photogrammetry](http://steamcommunity.com/games/250820/announcements/detail/117448248511524033) -- essentially, the use of 3-d photography for image capture. That's a tech which is still too complex and expensive for most game projects but it's advancing rapidly -- if it follows the same trajectory as motion capture did we'll see affordable, hiqh-quality 3D spatial captures in a lot of places. 

So, in that sense 'games like Battlefront' will make for great VR experiences because the same basic techniques are going to be used for all sorts of VR tourism applications: it won't be too long (say, 5-7 years?) before you can comb through the interior of a pyramid, or scuba-dive through the ruins of the Titanic, or roam the halls of Macchu Picchu without ever leaving home: 

In another sense I'm not so sure. Advances in photogrammetry are predictable: it's mostly about more accessible equipment, higher quality sensors, and better pipelines for compressing and rending that data in a VR context. I don't think that we've really cracked the input technologies you'd need to turn Battlefront into a real first-person experience yet: while there are some interesting prototypes out there they are either very big and expensive....



Or very different from actually walking (and ducking, shooting, or swinging a light-sabe)....





I'm not sure when or even if the gap between visual side of VR and the tactile-kinetic side will really be closed , at least in a way that's affordable for individuals. Floating around like a disembodied ghost is a great way to explore the Sistine chapel or the Topkapi Palace. Unless you're Dead Ben Kenobi it's not as much of a way to take on the Empire.
