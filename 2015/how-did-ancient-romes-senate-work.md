As [Assaph Mehr](https://www.quora.com/profile/Assaph-Mehr) says, this is a big complex topic and one that changed a good bit over time. To keep this from going too long I'll focus on the Republican period -- the institutions of the Roman kingdom aren't well documented and under the empire the Senate was mostly ornamental, a kind of Roman version of the 21st century House of Lords.

The key thing to remember about the senate is that it was not really a legislature. In theory, at least, new laws were supposed to come from the assemblies: the direct vote of the citizen populace. That's not as democratic as it sounds, because the assemblies were fairly easy to game : the [centuriate assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_Assembly) voted by property class and was heavily weighted in favor of the wealthy, while the [tribal assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_Assembly) was very gerrymandered. Despite those un-democratic features, however, sovereignty still belonged directly to the people and only they could pass laws or permanently alter the arrangements of the Roman state.

The Senate was not elected directly: you became a member of the Senate when you were elected to one of the 4 higher magistracies (there were plenty of lower magistracies -- things like market commissioners or local tax assessors -- which didn't lead to the Senate). In typical Roman fashion the ladder of powerful offices was was regarded as a competition _[cursus honorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursus_honorum)_ __ or "race of honors". The first rung on the ladder was the office of [quaestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaestor), followed by [aedile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedile), [praetor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetor) and ultimately [consul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul). Election to any of these offices allowed you to join the Senate , but your influence and precedence within the Senate depended on your office: the opinion of an ex-consul carried far, far more weight than that of recently minted quaestor.

Membership was for life, although you could be expelled from the Senate for gross immorality (rare) or for falling below the property qualification (more common, but still rare. At the end of the Republic many Senators were only kept in the Senate by loans from wealthy and powerful dynasts: Julius Caesar, for example, should have been expelled several times over, but big loans from [Crassus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Licinius_Crassus) allowed him to dodge the censors).

The day to day job of the Senate was to 'advise' the magistrates. In practice this was more like 'direct' the magistrates: as a magistrate, you would only be in office for a year, after that you'd be spending the rest of your life in the society of the wealthy, powerful and ambitious aristocrats of the Senate: ignoring their decrees was a... daring?... career move. That move could be taken and sometimes was -- strong willed and ambitious politicians like [Marius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Marius) or [the Gracchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracchi) could and did use their offices in ways that the Senate disapproved of -- but they were exceptional: in the ordinary course of events the Senate was more or less like the executive branch in the US: it enacted policy through the magistrates, while the assemblies created laws. 

After the [conflict of the orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_the_Orders) (4th c BC political struggle between the old patrician nobility and the plebeians) the Romans added a non-senatorial office which was designed as a check on the power of the Senate. The [tribunes of the Plebs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribune_of_the_Plebs) were allowed to veto ('forbid") any action of a magistrate or a decree of the Senate. The tribunes were not Senators -- their whole job was to act as a check on the power of the Senate by obstructing its primary tools, the magistrates. However tribunes could convene a Senate meeting and negotiate with the Senate on behalf of the people; they could also convene the [Plebeian Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebeian_Council), which was another law-making assembly with slightly fewer powers than the other assemblies. You can analogize the role of the tribunes to that of shop stewards in a union workplace: they could not make or direct policy but they had the ability to call a 'strike' (in fact, the office originated in exactly that, a mass walkout by plebeians fed up with patrician arrogance). That strike-calling ability gave them the ability to negotiate with the Senate from a position of some power. By the end of the Republic, however, the tribunician power was frequently abused: a single tribune could bring the business of the city to a halt, and many necessary measures were stymied by intransigent -- or, often, bribed -- tribunes.

The most extraordinary power of the Senate was the power to temporarily suspend the laws in time of emergency. This could take two forms; the [senatus consultum ultimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senatus_consultum_ultimum) and the appointment of a [ dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_dictator).

A dictator was essentially a 'temporary king': a temporary magistrate with absolute power. The dictatorship was typically used in periods of military crisis -- the most famous examples are the dictatorships of [Cincinnatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Quinctius_Cincinnatus) and [Fabius Maximus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabius_Maximus). In the early republic, when the collective discipline of the aristocratic classes was more powerful, dictatorship was a useful emergency measure; however in the last century of the republic it became increasingly like what we describe with the same word: [ Cinna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Cinna), [Sulla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla) and Caesar all used the legal fiction of the office to disguise what were essentially coups.

The [senatus consultum ultimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senatus_consultum_ultimum) was more like a declaration of martial law: it left the consuls and other magistrates in office but authorized them to do whatever they felt necessary for the safety of the Republic. It was, however, a vague and legally ambiguous sanction: it originated in the (otherwise illegal) murder of [Tiberius Gracchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Gracchus) in 133 BC, and it was never clear that the SCU actually legitimized the acts of the consuls. Cicero, for example, was prosecuted and exiled for executing the members of the [Catilinarian conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Catilinarian_conspiracy), even though he did so with the authority of the SCU and an additional vote by the Senate in favor of the executions. 

In the main the Senate _(huge generalization alert!)_  functioned fairly well until the mid 2d century BC. In contrast to, say, Greek city states Rome's ruling classes were generally pretty disciplined and coherent (the murder of Gracchus in 133 was the first political assassination in Rome in four centuries. Unfortunately it was not the last) The strong collective tradition of the Senatorial class created characters like Cincinnatus and Fabius who voluntarily resigned supreme power, and the continuity provided by life membership and seniority meant Roman policies tended to be less erratic and less factionalized than their Greek counterparts. The fact that the system survived the war with Hannibal -- twenty years of dire crisis -- is a testimony to how well it worked. However, once Carthage and Macedonia were finally eliminated as rivals (circa 146 BC) the competition among Roman politicians became more and more intense and dangerous: as agents of the 'sole superpower' generals like Marius, Sulla, Pompey and Caesar could amass so much wealth and power that the rest of the Senate put together could scarcely contain them. In the end it was conflicts between those powerful generals that destroyed the Republic and turned the Senate into little more than a prestigious social club.
