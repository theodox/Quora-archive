The [Loeb Classical Library](http://www.loebclassics.com/) covers most extant authors and its great for working your way through original texts because publishes Greek and English on facing pages so you always have a translation ready to hand (even though the translations are often a little flat). You can get in in print form or [digitally](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674425088).
