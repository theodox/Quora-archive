Another great answer from [User-10661484422791150723](https://www.quora.com/profile/User-10661484422791150723)... The bit I'd add would be to suggest that she sits at the intersection of of three very different but very influential ways of talking about history in a way that few historical personalities manage.

Ethan's answer has the political side: She was a key player in the dizzying power struggles which spanned the end of the Republic and which, for a variety of reasons, we know a great deal about (it's hard to over-estimate how much we have _lost_  in terms of original source material about even this well documented time, and many other equally interesting and important periods exists for us only through a single source or fragments of lost authors) . So one reason Cleopatra is special is because she was an important figure in an important period which is well documented. 

Historiographically, she's one of the most well documented women of antiquity as well. This was not a period in which women played big roles on the public stage, so she gets a lot of attention from scholars who want to investigate this poorly documented aspect of antiquity, and from writers looking for feminist role models.

Finally -- but I think most importantly -- the first two answers combine with the non-academic, non-political tradition of writing history as drama. This tradition goes all the way back to ancient authors like Plutarch or Herodotus who saw history primarily through the lens of human interactions and personalities. Unlike modern history, which looks at big impersonal forces like economics, politics, and social change the "dramatic school" of history focuses on memorable personalities and dramatic situations. Cleopatra's story is pure gold for the dramatic historian: it includes notable personalities like Caesar, the calculating but overly trusting genius; headstrong, passionate Antony; Octavian, the ruthless but farsighted dictator. 

Most important of all is Cleopatra herself, who managed to form close liaisons with with two of the most powerful men of a turbulent age. Her story is full of memorable incidents -- the apocryphal story of 
[having herself rolled into a carpet](http://carpetandspace.com/index.php?id=29) to sneak into a private audience with Caesar:

The fact that she bore Caesar's only son, and made a spectacular entry into Rome:

The famously luxurious effort to woo Athony in Tarsus:



> The barge she sat in, like a burnish’d throne, Burned on the water: the poop was beaten gold; Purple the sails, and so perfumed that The winds were lovesick with them; the oars were silver, Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made The water which they beat to follow faster, As amorous of their strokes. For her own person, It beggar’d all description: she did lie In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue, O’erpicturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature: on each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, With divers-colour’d fans, whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, And what they undid did.

 - Shakespeare, _Antony and Cleopatra_ 

And of course her (reputed) dramatic suicide by snake:


And it's all wrapped up in exotic costumes and settings (never mind that she lived a a millennium and a half after the age of the pyramids, the exotic decor and lavish trimmings a priceless to a would-be artists, poet, or filmmaker). These are the makings first-class potboiler. 

Not surprisingly this story is a perennial favorite of authors down the ages from ancient times to George Bernard Shaw, Bocaccio, Corneille, and Shakespeare. With that kind of copyright-free background, movies like the [1963 film with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_%281963_film%29) or the [1934 version with Claudette Colbert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_%281934_film%29) are inevitable.
