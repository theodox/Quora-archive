It's extremely likely, though of course all sorts of things could change the picture. We can only talk about averages and probabilities: if, in fact, you're descended from a _couple_  that moved to Italy from Germany in the 15th century to work in the woolen mills of Florence -- or one that came from Libya in the 1960s -- the statistics are very different. 

At it's peak in the late first and early second centuries Rome had a nominal population of over a million. 'Italy' -- not quite synonymous with the modern nation-state but close enough for horseshoes -- had a population of 8 million or so: Rome, therefore, accounted for something between 12 and 15 % of the population of the peninsula. 

A modern Italian has between 67 and 82 generations of ancestors to get back to the age of Julius Caesar in 46 BC, depending on whether you choose to use 25 or 30 years as a generation. Either way, that's a _lot_ of ancestors. 

Exactly how many is [very hard to actually figure out](https://thewildpeak.wordpress.com/2012/03/04/how-many-ancestors-do-you-have/). For, say, 67 generations the 'theoretical' number of ancestors is 1.1805916e+21 -- that, a 1.18 followed by _21 zeros._ 82 generations is about 32,000 times more than that.

_Adds up fast..._  

In practice, though, the overwhelming majority of those trillions of slots are actually duplicates: the further back you go, there more frequently you are descended from the same person through multiple lines (this is known as "pedigree collapse"). 

Still, for this many generations the total is still so unavoidably large that _on average_ , anyway, a modern Italian is descended from _everyone in Caesar's Italy_ . Which suggests that for most modern Italians, something like 1 in 8 of their ancestors at one point came the _urbs_ . 

BTW, one good example of an exception to the statistics is Caesar himself. His only known biological heir, [Caesarion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarion), disappeared after Octavian defeated Cleopatra in 30 BC although an ancient rumor had it that he escaped to India with Cleopatra's treasure...

... In which case most of modern _India_  is descended from Caesar. On average.
