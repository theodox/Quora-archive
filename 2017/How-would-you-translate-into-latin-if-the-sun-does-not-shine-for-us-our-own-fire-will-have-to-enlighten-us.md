This isn’t exactly literal:

_sole non lucente, nos nostri foci inlucundi sumus_ 

Word by word it’s “[since] the sun is not shining, we by our own hearths are illuminated” . I tried to balance out _lucens_ , “shining” with _inluceo_ “illuminate”. There are bunch of not-quite exact matches for “enlighten” — none of them has the philosophical or spiritual overtones of the English word but _inluceo_  is literally “shine in-or-onto” so it’s not a bad proxy. _focus_  is literally “hearth”, so it’s “our fireplace” — _flamma_  or _ignis_ are basically ‘flame’ and ‘fire’ respectively. Both have slight overtones of destructiveness where _focus_ is tamer, more domestic.

A more literal version would be

_Si sol nobis non luceret, nostrae flammae nos illustrati sumus_
