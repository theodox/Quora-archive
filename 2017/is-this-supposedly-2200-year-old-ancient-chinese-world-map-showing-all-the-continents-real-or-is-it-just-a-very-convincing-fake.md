# Is this supposedly 2200-year-old Ancient Chinese world map showing all the continents real, or is it just a very convincing fake?

[It’s a fake](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0123_060123_chinese_map.html) (there was an answer somewhere here on Quora debunking it, but I can’t find it). Or, to be more precise, it’s probably an authentic Chinese map, but it’s no older than about the middle of the 18th century. At least in our timeline it took about 300 years for tens of thousands of Europeans sailors to map out all of the details in that image, from tiny isolated bits like the [Kerguelen Islands ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerguelen_Islands)to Hawaii. It would be astonishing if the Chinese had done all of that and then forgotten about it.

The more common story about this map is not that it’s two thousand years old, but that it dates to the voyage of [Zheng He, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_He)a Ming Dynasty admiral who did lead China’s only major foray into long-distance overseas exploration in the early 1400’s. Zheng He’s fleet absolutely did visit the Java Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean; here’s a modern reconstruction of his route:

It’s a very impressive voyage for 1415, but it has attracted a set of, er, _[enthusiastic revisionists](https://badarchaeology.wordpress.com/tag/gavin-menzies/)_  who want to interpret that map and a few similar ones as evidence that the Chinese ‘got there first’ and beat the Europeans to the new world. The primary evidence for that is a remark by a Venetian cartographer, [Fra Mauro, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fra_Mauro_map)who around 1450 recounted the voyage of a Chinese vessel past ‘Cape Diab’, which is how he identifies the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. However Fra Mauro says the Chinese vessel never saw anything except wind and water — and that it returned to Cape Diab in 70 days.

That’s a very short window to map all of North and South America. And it’s not actually connected with Zheng He apart from falling within a generation or so of the same time period.

It’s probably significant that the [Gavin Menzies](http://www.gavinmenzies.net/), the westerner most responsible for pushing the Chinese-got-the-new-world-first idea wrote a [followup in which another Chinese fleet visited Italy, igniting the Renaissance](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3557568/Gavin-Menzies-mad-as-a-snake-or-a-visionary.html) — again without anybody in Europe or China bothering to take note of the fact.
