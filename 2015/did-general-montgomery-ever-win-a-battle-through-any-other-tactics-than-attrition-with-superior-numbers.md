Careful preparation and avoidance of risk were definitely hallmarks of Montgomery's style. He wasn't unimaginative, but he was very conscious of casualties: as a survivor of the first world war -- particularly of [ Passchendaele](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Battle_of_Passchendaele) -- and also as the most important allied commander during the dark days of 1941 he was deeply imbued with caution: the knowledge that the fate of the Empire could be decided by a single mistake had a very sobering effect on his character.

On the other hand he didn't always play it safe. He was the author of [Operation Market Garden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Market_Garden), which was nothing if not bold. It was not a natural fit for his talents, however, which might explain part of why it didn't play out for the best.
