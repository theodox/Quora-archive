Actually Greek armies — while they were still around — were rather more professional than their Roman counterparts; the Hellenistic armies of the various successor states were primarily staffed by mercenaries although in non-Greek lands there was also a core of citizen soldiers as well. Even in the remaining city-states the old citizen armies were mostly replaced by professionals in the last century or so of Greek independence.

This was, in fact, a big contributor to the success of Roman arms. The Roman armies that actually fought Greeks (as opposed to Gauls, or other Romans, in the first century BC) were mostly made up of long-service citizen levies who were politically reliable; the Greek armies they fought, being largely mercenary, were much less so. Since most of the Hellenistic kingdoms had a penchant for fratricide and palace intrigue, Roman perseverance mattered more than Greek tactical acumen, which was considerable. In any case almost none off the signal Roman victories over Greek armies were one without Greeks fighting on both sides.

The Roman army, after Marius, increasingly resembled its Hellenistic Greek predecessors and became less and less of a citizen force, more and more of a paid professional corps that followed its generals rather than the civilian leadership of Rome — with [unfortunately predictable consequences](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires)
