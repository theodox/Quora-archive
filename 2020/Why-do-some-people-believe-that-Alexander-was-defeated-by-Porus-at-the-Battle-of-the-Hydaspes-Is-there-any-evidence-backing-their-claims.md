The theory goes back, ultimately, to a speech given by Soviet Marshal Zhukov to cadets at the Indian Military Academy in 1957. The famous pull quote was that “Alexander suffered a worse defeat in India than Napoleon did at Moscow.”

There’s no positive evidence for this theory — the literary sources are well known and, barring some unforeseen archaeological discovery which changes the narrative we’re left with a bunch of written sources which _say_  Alexander defeated Porus and a bunch of modern interpreters who _say_ “that seems wrong to me” but can’t offer anything as a counterweight.

The only written authority that Zhukov cited by name was an English Egyptologist; people have been trying to find the “footnote” without success for a long time; the best guess is that it’s referring to the Englishman’s edition of a Syriac text of the [Alexander Romance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Romance), which was written several hundred years after Alexander. You can judge its historical accuracy from the fact that it claims Alexander was actually the son of the last Pharoah of Egypt, who secretly traveled to Macedonia, disguised himself as the god Amun, and impregnated Alexander’s mother.

There’s a much more detailed dissection of the Zhukov Thesis and the counterarguments here: [What is your opinion about the theory of Marshall Zhukov that Alexander had been defeated in India?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-about-the-theory-of-Marshall-Zhukov-that-Alexander-had-been-defeated-in-India/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=8862e226&srid=zLvM)
