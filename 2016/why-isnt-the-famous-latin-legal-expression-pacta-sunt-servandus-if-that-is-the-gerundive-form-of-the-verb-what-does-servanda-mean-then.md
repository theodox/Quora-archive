# Why isn't the famous latin legal expression "pacta sunt servandus" if that is the gerundive form of the verb? What does "servanda" mean, then?

_pacta sunt servanda_  means “agreements must be carried out”. _Pacta_  is the neuter plural of _pactum_  and in this case the gerundive is acting as a verbal adjective; as such it takes the number and gender of _pacta._ 

In Latin the gerundive form -ndus/a can be used to express obligation or necessity — thats the usage here. The famous tag line of Cato, _Carthago delenda est_  or “Carthage must be destroyed” is a good example. Our word _agenda_  is just ‘things which need to be done” (it’s a plural, btw : one to-do item is an _agendum,_ just like you have one _memorandum_  or multiple _memoranda_ to remember).
