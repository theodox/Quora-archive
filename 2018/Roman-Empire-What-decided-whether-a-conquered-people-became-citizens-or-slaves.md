Generally the Roman tactic was to try to find accommodations with the elites in defeated states, leaving them in power and using them as proxies rather than ruling conquered territories directly (there’s a longer discussion of this in [How did the Romans treat the people they conquered?](https://www.quora.com/Once-a-territory-had-been-conquered-how-did-the-Romans-treat-the-native-inhabitants/answer/Steve-Theodore)). Direct conquest and assimilation was usually not the first option, even for bitter enemies like Carthage. So, more often than not the status of most people in a defeated state would not change at all.

The primary exception to that was the case of cities which actively resisted a Roman field army. A city which offered more than a token resistance ran the risk of a sack, which could be extremely violent and destructive. The bulk of the slaves taken in war came from either battlefield captives or the civilian population of cities which fell by storm.

The theoretical justification both the relatively lenient treatment of those who surrendered and the terrible price exacted from those who were defeated at swordpoint was the same: like most cultures in the ancient Mediterranean the Romans believed that an enemy taken in combat had _already_ forfeited his life. The Latin for slave, _servus_ , is literally “saved” — the slave was somebody who the captor had saved from the general slaughter that was expected to follow on a battle.

In practice the line was not always as neat as I’ve drawn it here. For example [Aemilius Paullus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Aemilius_Paullus_Macedonicus) was regarded as the model of a civilized and moderate conqueror — until he allowed his army to enslave the populations of several cities in Epirus with no provocation or warning. Historians have puzzled over the reasons ever since, but this dark episode illustrates that the Romans did not always follow their own stated rules.

As for citizenship: generally, given the Roman preference for leaving local affairs in local hands, the citizens of a defeated state retained their old legal status. As far as Roman law went they were _peregrini —_ foreigners. They had commercial rights and could live and work in Roman territory, but were liable for taxes which Romans did not have to pay and (unless their community had a special deal with the Romans) they could not marry into Roman citizenship. As the empire grew, however, it became fairly easy for non-Romans to acquire citizenship. After the year 212 all free persons in the empire were citizens — though at that point all of Rome’s democratic and representative institutions were long dead, so the dignity of citizenship meant little in practice. There’s more detail in [What were the conditions for acquiring Roman citizenship during the Empire period?](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-conditions-for-acquiring-Roman-citizenship-during-the-Empire-period)

One last point: slavery was hereditary, but a large portion of slaves were freed during their lifetimes. Freed slaves got a sort of second-class citizenship, but children born to freed slaves were full citizens.
