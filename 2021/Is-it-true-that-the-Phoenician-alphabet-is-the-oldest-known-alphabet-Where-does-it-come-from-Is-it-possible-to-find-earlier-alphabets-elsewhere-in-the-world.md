# Is it true that the Phoenician alphabet is the oldest known alphabet? Where does it come from? Is it possible to find earlier alphabets elsewhere in the world?

It’s not actually the oldest alphabet.

The line between non-alphabetic and alphabetic script is actually a bit fuzzy: Egyptians wrote in hieroglyphics but on occasion they would use [acrophony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophony) — basically, reading the signs for the initial sounds of the words they depicted, rather than as whole words — to spell rare or foreign words. Since the Phoenician alphabet clearly uses acrophony as well (a picture of water = _mem_ in Phoenician = the sound __m__  ) it’s easy to see how there is a soft boundary between the Egyptian script and later alphabetic systems.

Against that background, the award for oldest alphabetic system is usually given to the [Proto-Sinaitic / Proto-Canaanite script](https://omniglot.com/writing/protosinaitc.htm), which uses Egyptian symbols combined with Semitic acrophony. It’s generally regarded the ultimate origin of our alphabet (by way of Phoenician and then of Greek).

In terms of dates, the oldest example of proto-Sinaitic is usually dated to around 1800 BC, seven or eight centuries before the oldest examples of Phoenician. Some scholars argue that the glyphs used in proto-Sinaitic reflect the way hieroglyphs were written even earlier, perhaps as far back as 2100 BC; others argue for a later date closer to 1650 BC at a period when Egypt was under the control of “Asiatic” dynasties with roots in Canaan.

Because proto-Sinaitic is not perfectly well understood, its possible that it retained the occasional ideograms or syllabic element as well. That would not be surprising — both Mesopotamian cuneiform and Egpytian heroglyphs went on for millennia using as mix of ideograms, syllabic writing, and acrophony. In a world where writing was mostly an expensive specialist skill, complexity was a form of job security for the literate minority.

The historic Phoenician alphabet [represents the marriage of symbols that originated in proto-Sinaitic with the idea of lexical ordering which came from an independently evolved alphabetic script, Ugaritic, from Syria.](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-the-alphabet-letters-put-in-the-order-we-know/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=8da571cf&srid=zLvM) We don’t have the evidence to be certain if Ugaritic reflects influences from proto-Sinaitic or if it is an independent invention. Ugaritic however is significantly later than proto-Sinaitic; the oldest Ugaritic texts are from the 12th or 13th century BC.
