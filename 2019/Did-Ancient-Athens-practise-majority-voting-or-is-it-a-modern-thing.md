It was majority voting by all citizens — but citizens were not a majority of all Athenians.

In theory, at least, citizenship in Athens was pretty restrictive — it was male only (that was true all over Greece) but you also had to prove that your parents were both free-born Athenian citizens; only a special grant of citizenship by the existing citizens would allow a non-citizen to naturalize, regardless of how long they had lived in the city. To the extent that the citizenship rolls were policed, probably fewer than a third of the male residents were citizens, with the rest being slaves, freedmen, or [metics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metic) — that is, resident aliens.

In practice it seems like the rules were not applied with perfect consistency — the strict version would have gradually reduced citizens to a tiny minority over time, but there’s no evidence that this occurred. We certainly see a lot of politicians trying to accuse their opponents of being “fake” citizens for political effect, which suggests that the boundaries were more porous than the very draconian laws were know of allow for. After about the mid 4th century, it became fairly common for wealthy freedmen and metics to purchase citizenship.
