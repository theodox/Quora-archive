The most common Greek love-gift was _pottery._ 

__Warning__ : NSFW ceramics to follow!

If you poke around a well-stocked museum of Greek antiquities, you’ll see a lot of pottery. One of the most common forms is a broad, shallow bowl, usually with two handles (the Greek term is a _[kylix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylix)_ ). These were used primarily for drinking wine, especially in social settings.

Typically the outside of the bowl is decorated with some kind of running scene, like this:

However many of them are also decorated inside, with scenes from mythology or everyday life. And one thing you’ll notice if you see a lot of them is that many of them have inscriptions on the inside:

More often than not the inscription is the name of a man (or really, a boy) and καλός_, “kalos”_ the Greek word for “handsome” or “beautiful.” This very common genre of illustration was the ancient Greek equivalent of a Valentine’s day card — a would-be lover would celebrate his infatuation with a younger man by presenting a kylix in a social setting where others would see it, usually an upper-class drinking party or [symposion,*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium#Symposium_as_a_social_activity_in_antiquity) like [the one famously described by Plato](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/symposium.html).

Kylices often had humorous or risque images in their bowls, designed to be revealed when the wine was drained (Greek wine was mostly dark).** We think that part of the ritual was to surprise the beloved with a vase whose message would be revealed when the wine was drunk.***

About 95 percent of the surviving “is beautiful” inscriptions are dedicated to young men. It’s thought that most of those dedicated to women are actually intended for _[hetairai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hetaira)_ , courtesans. Certainly the usual subject matter of the female oriented ones is considerably raunchier than what a respectable Greek woman would likely have appreciated.

The gender imbalance in the pottery has more to do with the nature of the evidence than with the statistical realities of Greek love and courtship: these were not products for ordinary people. Although a kylix was made of terracotta, it was a prized luxury item quite different from what an ordinary laborer would use for tippling. We know these were prized commodities because Athenian ware — the most highly sought after — shows up all over the Mediterranean world, from Syria to Catalonia; in a world where transport was expensive, only high-value items were worth transporting that far. These love-gifts were passed around among aristocrats — the sort of high rollers who practiced pederasty with boys and employed expensive courtesans for their drinking parties — this was the ancient Greek at its most louche.

Like any luxury product, the custom kalos-kylix inevitably spawned knockoffs, which were cranked out in factory settings in large quantities. Many, if not most kalos inscriptions actually don’t include a name: instead they say something generic like ὅ παῖς καλός, “the boy is beautiful” — or even just καλός by itself. These are the equivalent of those punch-out Valentine’s cards that children used to get for the entire class — a rather touching example of the limits of human imagination (and the existence of low-rent pickup artists) even in the heady air of classical Greece.

It’s worth mentioning that there is a little evidence for what folks farther down the social scale did when they couldn’t afford a choice vase. Longus’ _[Daphnis and Chloe](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Daphnis_and_Chloe_(The_1896_Athenian_Society_Translation))_ __ is much later than the classical heyday of the love-kylix, but it reflects older Greek models. It’s a love-story between a young goatherd named Daphnis and Chloe, a shepherdess. Among their many romantic ups and downs is a crass suitor — another herdsman — who tries to get between them by means of suitably rustic gifts:

> Thinking little of Daphnis, whom he looked upon as a mere child, he resolved to gain his object, either by bribery or violence. He first made them presents: to Daphnis he gave a rustic pipe, the nine reeds of which were fastened together with brass instead of wax, and to Chloe a spotted fawn's skin, such as Bacchus was wont to wear. Then, thinking that he was on sufficiently friendly terms with them, he gradually began to neglect Daphnis, while every day he brought Chloe a fresh cheese, a garland of flowers, or some ripe fruit; and once he presented her with a young calf, a gilt cup, and some young birds which he had caught on the mountains.

Even though critics have known for millennia that this is a highly stylized literary version of rural life, it’s still probably a better picture of real Greek courtship than any number of beautifully turned ceramics.



*Remember that etymology the next time you see a highfalutin’ “symposium” about arts and culture on your local PBS station!

** So, in addition to declarations of love these vases were also one of the oldest known contributions to the genre of novelty drink-ware, an artform made famous in the 1970’s by glasses of bathing beauties whose bikinis disappeared in the presence of a cold drink.

*** Thereby also predating the “will you marry me” Jumbotron message by more than 2400 years.
