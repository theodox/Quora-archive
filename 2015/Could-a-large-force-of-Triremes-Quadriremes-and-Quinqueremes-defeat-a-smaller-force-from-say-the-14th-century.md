This is an interesting one. Unlike a lot of military-alt-history questions the technological component to this one is much harder to tease out because it's fairly subtle. I do think however that the medieval force will have some very important, if non-obvious ace cards.

To a layman the situation would look fairly even. Both sides are using oar-propelled galleys and most of the fighting will really be done hand to hand. The ships will be of comparable size (170 oarsmen for a trireme, 300 for a quinquireme vs between 180 and 350 for a Venetian galleass). Hell, even as late as [Lepanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lepanto) in 1571 the Venetians were using ships like this:

Which -- to modern eyes at least -- looks like something that could have fought at Salamis or Actium (at least discounting those cannons). It is not quite the time period in the question but it's a useful example of some of the changes that really matter. 
There are some critical differences that you can see if you look a bit closer:

__Rudders:__ 

The galley above uses a stern post rudder; a Greek warship probably used steering oars instead.

Stern rudders came into use in the Mediterranean gradually between Roman imperial times and the 10th century. Most medieval shipping continued to use steering oars but the transition to stern rudders was under way as early as the 9th century.

_Not galleys - in the right temporal ballpark._ 

A stern rudder provides better mechanical advantage to the steersman, answers quicker, and is less vulnerable in a fight. So, if the 'modern' fleet has stern rudders they should have some significant tactical advantages: they'll be able to turn more tightly (especially at speed) and they won't loose their steering capability to sheering attacks. A favorite Athenian tactic was to race alongside an enemy ship, gunnel to gunnel, using the ships ram to sheer off sweeps and steering gear; the oars can be lifted out of the way but the steering tackle is vulnerable -- if you don't have a stern rudder.

__Skeletal construction__ 

Most ancient ships were built [shell first: ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_shipbuilding_techniques)The shipbuilder would build the skin of the ship first, under tension from cables, and then frame in supports. The basic structure was very flexible and light - ideal for ships that beached most nights, rather than tying up to a wharf -- but because it was under tension it was vulnerable to ramming. The dominance of the ram as a weapon in classical times reflects the facts that a ramming ship could literally explode an enemy ship with a well placed blow.

In the later Roman period ships began to be built frame-first. This is the method used until the 20th century, based around a support structure of keels and ribs and the skin fastened to that. This structure is heavier and less flexible — but also less vulnerable to catastrophic failure — than a shell first hull. So a Trireme that landed a solid hit on the flank of a galley would leave a big hole but the target would not disintegrate. Moreover the trireme might find itself locked into the structure of the damaged ship, taking both vessels down together.

__Sailing rig__ 

A very important advantage for the later forces is also shown in the galley picture: the galleys of the later middle ages were generally going to be rigged with [lateen sails ](http://www.britannica.com/technology/lateen-sail)rather than the square rigs of the classical period. This allowed for far better up-wind sailing:

Generally this would be a _strategic_  rather than a tactical advantage. It wasn't a good idea to keep your sails up in battle: they were big targets for flaming projectiles and vulnerable to leverage when your ship was hit. However they were an vital tool for deciding when and how to fight: the medieval flotilla would very easily be able to fight in a time and place of its own choosing.

_Note the absence of sails_ 

__Weapons__ 

In one sense the weapons technology on both sides is broadly similar, since we're excluding gunpowder weaponry. Both sides will be relying on similar tools -- although the medieval force will probably have access to higher quality armor and swords, thanks to the advances in metallurgy during the so-called 'dark ages'. A classical Greek force (in bronze hoplite gear) will be at a very significant disadvantage against 14th century armor and steel weapons; an imperial Roman force will be less burdened. If the medieval fleet is armed with steel-spring crossbows, they’ll have a significant advantage over the conventional Greco-Roman bows.

A significant imponderable is the use of [Greek fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_fire) : if the 14th century fleet had access to that it would be a significant advantage, particularly in a first encounter. However this was a weapon exclusive to the Byzantines which seems to disappear sometime after the 13th century.

__TLDR__ 

So: I suspect that all the advantages lay with the medievals. They aren't whiz-bang, Sherman-Tank-at-Gettysburg kind of advantages... but still they add up to a lot.
