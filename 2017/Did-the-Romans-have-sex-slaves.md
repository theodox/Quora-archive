Absolutely, yes.

Sexual access was a basic part of ancient slavery. The main restraints on what masters could do with their slaves were customary, rather than legal ( see [Could Romans do whatever they want with their slaves?](https://www.quora.com/Could-Romans-do-whatever-they-want-with-their-slaves/answer/Steve-Theodore) for some unpleasant examples). The social sanctions against killing and torture — such as they were — didn’t really extend to sexual matters in any meaningful way. To be a slave was, by definition, to be available for the master’s uses.

The large Roman prostitution industry was also staffed mainly by slaves. Here’s a good example of the underlying attitudes: a Roman lawyer imagines a freeborn girl captured by pirates.*

> Naked she stood on the shore, at the pleasure of the purchaser; every part of her body was examined and felt. Would you hear the result of the sale? The pirate sold; the pimp bought, that he might employ her as a prostitute.

Seneca, _Controversiae_  1.2

This was so common that it was a trope of comedy plots — not an aberration, just the ordinary day-to-day working of the slave economy. Prostitution was a basic social institution — even the staunchest conservatives regarded it as a safe alternative to adultery, which would have split the social fabric with vendettas and illegitimate children. And this huge business (well known from Pompeii and other sites, as well as from literature) was fueled primarily by slavery.

Sexual slavery was equal opportunity up to a point:

> another [slave], who serves the wine, must dress like a woman and wrestle with his advancing years; he cannot get away from his boyhood; he is dragged back to it; and though he has already acquired a soldier's figure, he is kept beardless by having his hair smoothed away or plucked out by the roots, and he must remain awake throughout the night, dividing his time between his master's drunkenness and his lust; in the chamber he must be a man, at the feast a boy

Seneca, _Letters to Lucillius_ 47

The only serious limitation was a strong taboo on free women having intercourse with male slaves. If nothing else, the chance of a slave’s child becoming the master’s heir was deeply unsettling to the slaveholders. Tales of high-born women consorting with slaves were a staple of Roman gossip; how much of that was true is unclear. Many households kept eunuchs as domestic slaves for this reason (it goes without saying that the eunuchs were, for the most part, castrated slaves). For free males, however, pretty much anything was allowable.**

Generally sex-slavery was an uncontroversial aspect of slavery in general, which saw very little criticism in the ancient world. The only real change happened in the 4th and 5th centuries, when Christian emperors began limiting the right of masters to sexual use of their slaves. Sex slavery was (legally, if not in actual practice) abolished for good under Justinian in the mid-500’s — perhaps because his wife, the Empress Theodora, was [allegedly a slave and prostitute in her youth](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Justinian-marry-Theodora/answer/Steve-Theodore).

A great reference on the relationship between sex and slavery in antiquity is [From Shame to Sin](http://amzn.to/2pbYyzL), by Kyle Harper. It’s focused on the later part of the period but gives a good deep background as well.



* In the full story, she is able to talk her ‘customers’ out of actually having sex — until one refuses to go along. She kills him, is tried, and — having proved herself wrongly enslaved to begin with — acquitted. If she hadn’t been freeborn, on the other hand, things would have been quite different.
** There were legal prohibitions on a citizen male being the receiving partner in anal or oral sex.
