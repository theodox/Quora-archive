They were ‘servants’ of [Cybele;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybele) whether the term ‘priests’ is right isn’t obvious. Literally the word is derived from ἀγείρω, to collect or to beg — which suggests that they were mendicants; in other contexts the word also applies to ordinary beggars. Agyrtoi were probably [Galli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galli), eunuchs — though it’s possible they were not all castrated. They were a familiar sight in Roman cities, begging for alms and offering blessings in return.
