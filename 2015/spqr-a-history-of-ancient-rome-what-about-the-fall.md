Peter Brown's [The World of Late Antiquity: AD 150-750 ](http://www.amazon.com/The-World-Late-Antiquity-Civilization/dp/0393958035)is probably the most important modern take on the late empire and (unlike most popular histories of the period) is not too overshadowed by Gibbon, whose great prose frequently disguises his very 18th century take on the period. 

Walter Goffarts [Barbarian Tides: The Migration Age and the Later Roman Empire ](http://www.amazon.com/Barbarian-Tides-Migration-Empire-Middle/dp/0812221052/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&dpID=51blSzBNE-L&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR109%2C160_&refRID=01FJPVZD3GSB0C7XADTJ)isn't a thrilling read -- it's full of a lot of obscure arguments about Roman land tenure and tax arrangments. However his basic idea -- that the 'fall' was much more orderly and less traumatic than its usually portrayed -- is very challenging and worth reading up on.
