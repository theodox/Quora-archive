If you’re following the traditional _[translatio imperii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translatio_imperii)_ _,_  as it was articulated in the Middle Ages, it’s Rome. However after that it get’s complicated. Here’s a few of the variations which you find in medieval texts and early modern texts:

Adso of Montier-en-Der (Francia): Roman Empire → Carolingian Franks → Saxons

Otto of Freising (Germania): Rome → Byzantium → Franks → Longobards → Germans (=Holy Roman Empire);

Chrétien de Troyes (France): Rome → France

Richard de Bury (England, 14th century): "Athens" → Rome → "Paris" → England

Fifth Monarchists (England, 17th century): Chaldeans (Babylonians) → Persians → Macedonian Empire → Rome → England

António Vieira (Portugal, 17th century): Assyro-Chaldeans (Babylonians) → Persians → Greeks → Romans → Portuguese
