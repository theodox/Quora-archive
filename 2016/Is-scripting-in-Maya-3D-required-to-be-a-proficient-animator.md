No.

That said, scripting can be a big force-multiplier for a lot of different jobs — if you get good at scripting you can tackle effects and tasks that would be a lot more cumbersome to do by hand. But it’s not a necessity, particularly if you work in an environment where there are dedicated riggers who provide the animation rigs for you to work with and technical animators to wrangle things like physics simulations and fluid effects.
