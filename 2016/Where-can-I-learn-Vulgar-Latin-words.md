If by "Vulgar Latin" you mean "medieval Latin of dubious grammatical quality" the usual reference is, I think, DuCange: [Glossarium mediae et infimae la](http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/)tinitatis , online but only in scanned form. I may be out of date on that one (it's the 1887 edition). For samples of medieval Latin there's [A Primer of Medieval Latin: An Anthology of Prose and Verse ](http://amzn.to/1Y3LZhk) or [Medieval Latin](http://amzn.to/1OcnDMC), Another good google term would be 'bas-Latin' (French for 'low latin"). I haven't tried [Corruptae Latinitatis Index: Or, a Collection of Barbarous Words and Phrases, which are Found in the Works of the Most Celebrated Modern Writers in Latin. With an Alphabetical Table, Shewing, what Words and Phrases, Taken from the Classics, Would Have ... Answered Their Purpose.](https://books.google.com/books?id=q55bAAAAQAAJ&dq=barbarous+latin&source=gbs_navlinks_s) but it sounds like fun, though it's really about 18th century neo-Latin not Roman Latin.

On the other hand, if you mean _vulgar_  Latin, you might try [A LONG list Latin swear words.](http://hollyoakhill.tumblr.com/post/32673016692/a-long-list-latin-swear-wordsphrasesetc-you-may) Evidently nobody has gotten around to digitizing the semi-legendary _Glossarium Eroticarum --_ a rumored but rarely seen tome from the dusty libraries of yore -- but if you're feeling scholarly [The Latin Sexual Vocabulary](https://monoskop.org/images/7/79/Adams_JN_The_Latin_Sexual_Vocabulary.pdf) should cover most of what you need.

This is an area in which the Romans excelled, so bring your A-game.

_Wait, that sounds wrong...._
