He was [not necessarily a nice man](https://www.quora.com/Did-Alexander-the-Great-kill-innocent-civilians-excluding-Cleitus-the-Black), and he was certainly guilty of what his Greek contemporaries would call _[hubris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris)_ _—_ arrogance, megalomania, and lack of consideration.

However, his flaws don’t fit the traditional profile of psychopathy. Lifting the definition quoted in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy):

> Psychopathy is traditionally a personality disorder characterized by persistent antisocial behavior, impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, and egotistical traits

Alexander certainly scores high on ‘egotistical,’ ‘disinhibited’, and ‘bold’. However he was famous for emotionalism and his closeness with his chosen companions: his exuberant love for [Hephaestion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestion) is the most famous example but close relationship with the Persian queen mother [Stateira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateira_I) and even his profound affection for his horse, [Bucephalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucephalus) are all examples of a nature which contemporaries saw as affectionate and loyal.

He was certainly capable of terrible rages, both against individuals and enemies on the battlefield: the destruction of Thebes and Tyre are examples of relentless violence. However by the standards of his day, Alexander was regarded as a mild conqueror, who preferred to assimilate rather than to annihilate defeated enemies; his treatment of the Persian royal family (captured on the field of Issus), of Sparta (which rebelled against him while he was fighting in the east) and of the Indian king [Porus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porus) were seen by contemporaries as evidence of a nature that was fundamentally chivalrous. For an ancient Greek out-sized success was as dangerous to a person’s character as failure, and most of his biographers regarded his worst deeds as evidence of a life that was immoderate in its passions, not one that was fundamentally cold or cruel.

That impulsive behavior carried over into private life too. Alexander’s murder of his old battlefield companion [Cleitus the Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleitus_the_Black) shows that not even a close friend could offend the king with impunity. However (at least in the ancient accounts) this too was an example of Alexander’s passionate nature gone too far, rather than the casual and remorseless violence of a psychopath who views other humans in a purely instrumental way. After he killed Cleitus (in a drunken rage, [according to Plutarch](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/8.html))

> No sooner had Cleitus fallen with a roar and a groan than the king's anger departed from him. And when he was come to himself and beheld his friends standing speechless, he drew the spear from the dead body and would have dashed it into his own throat, had not his body-guards prevented this by seizing his hands and carrying him by force to his chamber.

So no: Alexander was not a psycopath incapable of remorse or empathy.

It’s been repeatedly suggested that, in modern terms, he was a [narcissist](https://www.quora.com/Was-Alexander-The-Great-narcissistic) — [certainly his proclamation of his own divinity](https://www.quora.com/To-which-religion-did-Alexander-the-Great-belong/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=780da80c&srid=zLvM) smacks of narcissism in the extreme, although of course there were [purely canny political motives behind the gesture ](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised)as well. To his contemporaries he was an illustration of the dangers of a life lived immoderately. He was literally a “tragic” figure: like the heroes of most Greek tragedies was cursed by his inability to adhere to the [golden mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy)). His achievements and his crimes were inextricably linked by their inhuman scale.
