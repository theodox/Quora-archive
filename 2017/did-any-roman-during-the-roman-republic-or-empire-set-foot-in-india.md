This was surprisingly common. The Romans were [hugely interested in the international trade in spices and incense](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-Roman-thing-ever/answer/Steve-Theodore), which connected Roman Egypt with India through the Indian ocean.

Roman traders operated all over the west coast of India and as far south as Sri Lanka and the Andaman Islands. Roman coins [show up in Indian archaeological sites fairly often](https://www.amazon.com/Roman-Coins-Institute-Archaeology-Publications/dp/0905853237) (though coin finds are more often farther south and east: it’s likely that the Indian states of the north and west melted down specie from the west and reminted it more often). There are examples of Roman pottery as well. The archaeological site of [Arikamedu](https://www.thebetterindia.com/15551/indians-trade-site-with-ancient-romans-arikamedu-travel-pondicherry/) in Pondicherry yielded enough Roman artifacts that some people believe it hosted a permanent Roman community.

_Part of a museum exhibit from Kerala, asserting that the archaeological site at_ _[Pattanam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattanam)_ _is the long-lost Roman era trade port known as_ _[Muziris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muziris)_ 

A smaller number of traders made their way around to the Bay of Bengal.

This Renaissance copy of a Roman-era map isn’t very accurate. India (above “Indicus Pelagus”, the Indian Ocean) is squashed very much north-south, and Sri Lanka is way too large — but it does give a good idea of locations that the Romans had first-hand knowledge of.
