The basic [Flask Quickstart Documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/) also uses sqllite so if you work your way through that you'll have a good idea of the basics. If you're not familiar with working SQL, or have experience in something like Django and want to put a nice object-oriented from on your code, see [Griffin Michl](https://www.quora.com/profile/Griffin-Michl)'s answer for Peewee
