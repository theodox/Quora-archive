I think those are [editor’s marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelism), rather than punctuation - indicating an editorial correction or doubt about the original manuscript. The angle brackets in the sample are a good example: they usually indicate a word that the editor thinks was accidentally omitted from the manuscript. Critical marks are not always standardized, particularly if the text was edited before the 1950’s. If the text includes an__ _[apparatus criticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_apparatus)_ __ it will explain the marks as used by that particular editor.

This version of the text does not include them: [Aristoxenus-Elementa harmonica](http://www.poesialatina.it/_ns/greek/testi/Aristoxenus/Elementa_harmonica.html).

For poetry, you will see low dots for short pauses, middle dots for medium pauses, and high dots for long pauses, but the Elementa is prose.
