# Why did Phoenicians start forming the colonies so late? They have been on the Mediterranean since 1500 and developed active sea trade between late Bronze Age civilizations not long after?

The colonization efforts are often linked to the rise of the Assyrian empire. The Assyrians pushed westward into the Levant from the time of [Ashurnasirpal II ](https://www.ancient.eu/Ashurnasirpal_II/)(883–859 BC) onward, first imposing irregular tribute and eventually turning the Mediterranean coast into directly administered provinces.

The Assyrians very much wanted their empire to turn a profit. In particular, they expected commodities to be turned over in tribute. Here’s what Ashurnasirpal wrote about his campaign in the Levant*:

> The tribute of the sea coast – from the inhabitants of Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, Mahallata, Kaiza, Amurru and Arvad which is an Island in the sea, consisting of gold, silver, tin, copper, copper-containers, linen garments with multi-coloured trimmings, large and small monkeys, ebony, boxwood, ivory from walrus tusk, a product of the sea – this their tribute I received and they embraced my fee

The problem is that very few of the things in Ashurnasirpal’s list actually come from Phoenicia. As traders, the Phoenicians had access to these commodities — but with the Assyrians breathing down their necks they were under a good deal of pressure to find new sources of supply.

If you look at the places where Phoenician settlements start popping up after the 9th century BC, you’ll see that they concentrate in places that are connected to the Bronze Age sources of precious metals — particularly the silver, iron and tin of Iberia. The foundations which aren’t part of the metals trade tend to be the harbors and watering places needed to reach Iberia from the eastern Mediterranean. They weren’t created in order to give people new places to live or siphon off excess population** — the first settlers were less emigrants than expatriates.

_This map leaves out Iberia’s tin resources, which were highly prized even back in the Bronze age._ 

Traditional accounts of these places often date them much earlier than the archaeology. For example Gades in Spain is dated (in Greek sources, following Phoenician originals) to 1100 BC or so. However we have no archaeological evidence for the Phoenician presence before the 800’s. It’s suggested that the “foundation” dates for some of these old Phoenico-Iberian sites reflect the beginning of trade contacts, and that the archaeology reflects a 9th or 8th century push to create permanent colonies with direct control of important resources.

Eventually the colonies became less and less tightly connected with the mother country; by the sixth century Carthage was asserting its own control over Punic settlements in the western Mediterranean. The “trading post model” however remained the normal Phoenician settlement pattern down until the end of the first Punic war. Hoping to recoup the losses from that defeat, Carthage began creating a more traditional territorial empire, particularly in Iberia but also in the North African hinterland.



* I’m not clear where the “walrus” translation comes from: I’d suspect “hippo tusk” is better, since among other things hippo ivory was common in regions like Byblos where there were long ties to Egypt.
** Phoenicians in this period were still practicing ritual infanticide; they had their own ways of dealing with population pressure.
