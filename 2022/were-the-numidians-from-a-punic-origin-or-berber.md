It’s always important to remember that ancient group identities (like modern ones) are a mix of genetic, linguistic, political and cultural markers and the borders between Carthaginians and their neighbors were particularly porous.

Ancient sources mark four major groups in the region in antiquity:

__Punic__  people were associated with the language and culture of Carthage. Many of them were the descendants of the original Phoenician settlers, but intermarriages and immigration into the Punic cities from the countryside meant that there were plenty of visibly “Punic” people with ancestors who had been in North Africa before the Phoenicians arrived. At least after a generation or two “Punic” meant “lives in a city, speaks Punic more often than not.”

__Libyans__  were the proto-Amazigh people living east and south of Carthage; they are probably the same folks who the Egyptians knew as the [Libu or Rebu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libu). In Carthaginian times they had a lot of cultural influence from Egypt. The coastal regions of Cyrenaica had Greek cities but the inland regions were mostly indigenous (we assume that, as in Carthage, there was a good deal of cultural interchange but this area is very poorly documented). The rural Libyans tended to be pastoralists rather than farmers, and they had close relations with desert-dwelling people like the [Nasamones ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasamones)and the [Garamantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamantes), who operated outside the reach of the Mediterranean based powers.

Closer to Carthage there was a distinctive mixed culture known as __Libyphoenicians__ , a group that was the product of intermarriage and cultural fusion between Libyans and Punic settlers — they were urban and the practiced settled agriculture. They were not always on friendly terms with Carthage, though they did feature prominently in Hannibal’s armies.

West of Carthage and outside the hinterland of the Punic cites were the __Numidians.__ Linguistically and presumably “ethnically” they were, like the Libyans, part of the proto-Amazigh cultural sphere and primarily pastoralists — they were famous in antiquity as skilled and daring light cavalry, and they went on to serve on all the Roman frontiers.

The Numidian language is related to modern Berber languages — one of our very few Numidian inscriptions reads _MSNSN GLDT W GJJ_ , where _MSNSN_ is the name [Massinissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masinissa), “lord”, _GLDT_ corresponds to [agellid](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agellid), “king” or “master”, W GJJ would be _“son of Gaia”_ (the [Numidian script](http://mnamon.sns.it/index.php?page=Scrittura&id=47&lang=en) did not record vowels).

Once again, though, the picture is complicated by cultural borrowings, language sharing, and intermarriage: [Numidian kings married Carthaginian princesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophonisba) and some of them bore [Punic names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastanabal); after the fall of Carthage plenty of Punic cities were at least nominally ruled by the Numidians but they clearly retained their own language.

By late in the Roman era, Numidian or Libyan inscriptions more or less disappear, and there’s evidence that as the cities became more and more Latin in language and culture the countryside became more Punic speaking. The indigenous languages continued to thrive — it’s just that during this period were rare in writing. We still see [Berber personal names ](http://www.punic.co.uk/phoenician/latnames/latnames.html)in throughout this period.

So, overall, the Numidians were “mostly” coming from the population that’s ancestral to modern Berbers but the boundaries between them and their neighbors were often fuzzy. People’s reasons for adopting languages and cultural styles can vary a lot. A Roman-era local king like [Juba II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II) represented a Berber-inflected royal tradition: his father’s name was Bocchus, related to Tuareg name Aweqqas, “lion”; his great-to-the-3rd grandfather was Massinissa). But he wrote books in Greek, married a daughter of Cleopatra, and decorated his coins with Latin, Greek, and Punic inscriptions.
