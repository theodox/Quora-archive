Yes, although it’s hard to be sure about who an ancient author really means when they say ‘Aethiopian.’

The Greek word _[Αἰθίοψ](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%91%E1%BC%B0%CE%B8%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%88#Ancient_Greek)_ _(Aithíops)_ is the root word for the modern name of Ethiopia, but the Greeks used it very sloppily for anyone they regarded as dark skinned. Usually it refers to Africans, but sometimes to people from India too, so it s usually a good idea to check the context of a particular quote. Latin authors borrowed the Greek word and the Greek lack of precision.

So, you will find a lot of references to “Aethiopians” in Greek and Roman literature but you have to check context of a particular quote to figure out what the author is really saying. There are a lot of literary references where “Aethiopia” is just a vague term for “exotic place with dark skinned people”. It doesn’t help that some stories get recycled over and over—you will see bits of misinformation first written down by Herodotus around 500 B.C. still being recycled by literary sources 600 years later.

However there are also completely practical contemporary references too.

In the early Roman Empire a reference to Aethiopia usually means the kingdom of [Meroe](https://www.ancient.eu/amp/1-261/) which was centered in modern Sudan. Meroe bordered on Roman Egypt and had a long history of both trade and conflict with Egypt. So, individuals from Meroe were not a surprising sight in Egypt and they also showed up elsewhere. We can’t really put numbers on the levels of trade or immigration — the data we would need just doesn’t exist— but there are enough scattered references that we can assume Meroeans were known, if not exactly common, in the imperial era. The “Ethiopian” eunuch in the New Testament story was a servant of the queen of Meroe — and the fact that he had gone on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem shows how much Meroe was part of the commercial world of the first century.

Between about 100 and 350, Meroe gradually declined as a power and the kingdom of [Axum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum) came to dominate the Horn of Africa. “Aethiopia” — never a very exact word — came to mean “Axum” without much fanfare.

Axum — centered on the Ethiopian city if that name— assumed Meroe’s place in Sudan but it’s real power derived from a critical role in the lucrative Indian Ocean spice trade. The Axumite empire extended east into southern Arabia and south along the African coast into modern Eritrea. We are not sure about the language of Meroe but Axumites spoke [Ge'ez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%27ez) — the ancestor of modern Amharic and Tigrinya and still the language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. So by maybe the fourth century or so a Greek or Latin reference to “Aethiopia” will most of the time refer to at least a part of modern Ethiopia.

_This image from Roman Edessa (modern Urfa, Turkey) dates from the heyday of the Roman-Axumite trade relationship in the late 4th / early 5th centuries. I think that the zebra in the image is supposed to be a_ _[Grevy’s zebra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grévy's_zebra)_ _from Ethiopia. If that’s correct the handlers is probably intended to be an Axumite._ 

The close economic ties between Rome and Axum led to the Christianization of Axum in 325 ( several years before Christianity was a state religion in Rome) . Roman and Axumite armies cooperated against the Persians in Arabia in the 500’s.
