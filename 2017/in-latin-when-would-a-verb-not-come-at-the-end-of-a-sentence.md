Latin word order is not exactly “random”, but it’s pretty unpredictable. SOV (subect - object -verb) is used about 45 % of the time, but SVO is used almost as often (42 %) and the remaining 13% is pretty much “whatever” order.

There’s no generally agreed upon principle for whether one order or another implies a particular meaning or intention. So _Caesar gallos vincit_ or _Caesar vincit gallos_  would be about equally common, but _vincit gallos Caesar_ and _vincit Caesar gallos_  are both possible if a little unusual.

To my own ear the the first sounds puts the emphasis on Caesar’s agency, the second on the fact that he defeated the Gauls rather than doing something else, and the other two might come up in answer to questions (or as questions).

In poetry, where metre is important, the order is much more likely to be unpredictable. Another variable is words with oddball declensions that might incline a writer to try to clarify the structure to avoid ambiguity. But there’s no hard and fast rule.
