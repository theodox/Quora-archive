From the perspectives of Latin speakers... One assumes there were plenty of stereotypes flying in other directions.

Easterners in general, but particularly Syrians, Levantines and people from Asia minor were derided as effeminate, addicted to luxury, and sensualists. Descriptions put a lot of emphasis on silken robes, oiled ringlets, and perfume.

Greeks were regarded as untrustworthy and duplicitous - clever and honey-tongued but always ready to betray or cheat. "Too clever by half". The Greek cities of Southern Italy and especially Sicily were bywords for luxurious living (our word "Sybaritic" comes from Sybaris on arch of the Italian boot). However disdain for Greek smooth-talking was matched with respect for Greek culture and literature. As Cicero put it (_Pro Flacc0, 8)_ 

> I say this of the whole race of Greeks; I allow them learning, I allow them a knowledge of many arts; I do not deny them wit in conversation, acuteness of talents, and fluency in speaking; even if they claim praise for other sorts of ability, I will not make any objection; but a scrupulous regard to truth in giving their evidence is not a virtue that that nation has ever cultivated; they are utterly ignorant what is the meaning of that quality, they know nothing of its authority or of its weight.

Egyptians were thought to be mystical and otherworldy - or priest-ridden and superstitious. They were famous for being excellent physicians and notoriously useless in a fight.

Carthaginians - while they were still independent - were regarded as mercenary and venal, motivated primarily by greed (although there was a counter-tradition which admired the boldness and dedication of Hannibal, in particular). The stereotype was similar to modern anti-semitic attitudes and conspiracy theories about rich bankers. After Roman conquered Carthage, Roman North Africans were reputed to be sarcastic and sharp-tongued (eg Terence, Tertullian)

"Moors" - from Numidia, Mauretania, and Tingis - were supposedly passionate and emotional. They were brave but headstrong, romantic and imprudent.

Germans were universally regarded as big and fierce. They were alternately praised for simplicity, bravery, and honor or derided for lack of culture, treachery and savagery. "Noble savages", with variable emphasis on the two halves of that phrase.

Gauls were stereotyped similarly to Germans, with an extra emphasis on their fondness for strong drink. That stereotype faded out as Gaul Romanised very thoroughly.

Ethiopians were supposed to be dignified and aloof, disdainful of outsiders and uninterested in the rest of the world. This may be less of a real stereotype and more an inheritance from Herodotus' descriptions of the Icthyophagi.

Central Italians, particularly in Latium but throughout the territory of Rome's one-time allies, were regarded as plain, honest, and level headed - sort of "heartland" salt-of-the-earth types compared to the rest of the Empire. Of course, they were the people making up all the other stereotypes above.
