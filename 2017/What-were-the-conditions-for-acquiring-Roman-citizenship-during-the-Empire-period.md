There are two very different answers to this, depending on when you’re asking.

__Early Empire__ 

The early empire inherited the Republican system.

At home, the children of free-born Romans were citizen. Free “foreigners” were _[peregrini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrinus_(Roman))_ _;_ for most practical purposes they lived under the laws of their own communities, though in any situation where Roman interests became involved, Roman courts and laws supervened. Peregrini could not legally marry Roman citizens, at least not in the eyes of Roman law — so a the child of a mixed marriage would not be a citizen.

Manumitted slaves occupied a halfway position. They were citizens, but they still had some legally binding obligations to their former masters and were barred from many kinds of public office. However their children (at least those born after the parents were freed) were ordinary citizens.

During the early empire, grants of citizenship were made by representatives of the Empire or by the Senate. This was a valuable privilege even for provincials who had no interest in Roman politics: it guaranteed that any legal cases you were involved in would be handled in Roman courts, where a “Roman” had built-in advantages over a non-citizen and where a citizen was protected from torture or execution; it also carried exemption from the _[tributum capitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tributum_capitis)_ , the empire-wide poll tax which all non-citizen subjects owed. Perhaps most important of all it was an assertion of status, a clearly visible badge of belonging to the Powers That Be.

The grant of citizenship could be made on an individual basis by a Roman governor or the emperor (the legal basis of this right isn’t clear, but the practice was very widespread). Politically important provincials were given citizenship as a reward for service or to bind their interest more closely to Rome’s. The less exalted managed to get citizenship as well: service as a Roman auxiliary, for example, was often rewarded with citizenship. And, of course, it was possible to convince a Roman governor (or one of the functionaries who handled the actual business of government) with cash.

Citizenship could also be granted to entire communities. In the western half of the empire, cities were awarded “Latin rights” — a holdover from the Republican era where the status of a Latin city was a not-quite-Roman halfway stage between full citizenship and peregrine status. In a Latin-right city upper magistrates automatically became Roman citizens.

Sometimes the grant was made to entire communities. A city with the status of a _colonia_  was, by definition, a city of Roman citizens. _Coloniae_  were originally settlements of ethnic Romans — usually legionary veterans — but as time wore on the distinction of being a _colonia_  and the citizenship that came with it was a political plumb; existing cities could be ‘refounded’ as _colonia_  gaining citizen rights.

A good example of the complex web of Roman citizenship shows up in the _Acts of the Apostles, 25 ff._ 

> But as he was being tied with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?"

> Now when the centurion heard this, he went and reported it to the tribune, saying, "Do you realize what you are about to do? For this man is a Roman." And when the tribune came up, he said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?" And he said, "Yes." And the tribune answered, "With a great sum of money I bought this citizenship." And Paul said, "But indeed, I was born free"

Paul — a not particularly prominent Jew — was a Roman citizen by birth. It’s not clear if his native Tarsus was a _colonia_  at this point in time, though it was definitely one later. Meanwhile the “Roman” officer admits that he purchased his citizenship for cash. At this period the legions were nominally open only to Roman citizens: an ambitious provincial who wanted a Roman military career could smooth the way by arranging to become a citizen. Centurions and tribunes were usually from better-off families so it’s not surprising that an officer candidate could come up with the money. Paul ended up being shipped to Rome for his trial, since as a citizen he could only be tried there.

__After 212__ 

The system got[ radically simplified in the year 212](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutio_Antoniniana). As the Roman legal scholar Ulpian — who, being born in the _colonia_  of Tyre in Phonicia, was already a citizen — wrote:

> _In orbe romano qui sunt ex constitutione imperatoris antonini cives romani effecti sunt._ 

> All persons in the Roman world were made Roman citizens by an edict of the Emperor Antoninus [Caracalla]

_A fragmentary version of Caracalla’s edict granting citizenship to all free people in the empire_ 

Opinion has always been divided on the motives for Caracalla’s action. It can be seen as the final stage in Rome’s program of assimilating and incorporating former enemies. However even in antiquity it was suggested that the motive was cynical: Cassius Dio believed that

> nominally he was honoring them, but his real purpose was to increase his revenues by this means, inasmuch as aliens did not have to pay most of these taxes.

The cynical view is that enlarging the citizenry made more people eligible for the inheritance tax (Caracalla did not abolish the poll tax). Another possibility is that he was looking for political cover, having[ murdered his own brother and co-emperor the previous year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geta_(emperor)).

_Caracalla. He doesn’t_ look_like an idealist._ 

On the more idealistic view, the change reflected the unity of a world that had been politically united for more than two centuries and which had achieved a deep multicultural synthesis. It began in earnest the project of unifying Roman law into a universalist framework, rather than an accretion of political compromises and accidents.

Unfortunately Caracalla’s reign was poised on the threshold of a bitter time for the Roman world. Within about 20 years the empire tipped into t[wo generations of civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century) which would come close to completely destroying the Roman order. In the world that emerged at the end of the third century the distinction between “citizen” and “subject” mattered a lot less: because the status of all free people in the empire had significantly eroded as the empire became more autocratic, more militarized, and more bureaucratically centralized.
