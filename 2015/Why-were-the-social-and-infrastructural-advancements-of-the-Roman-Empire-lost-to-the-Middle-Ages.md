As [Assaph Mehr](https://www.quora.com/profile/Assaph-Mehr) points out, the 'losses' tend to be vastly overstated in most people's imagination, and the countervailing gains in areas like metallurgy, agriculture and navigation are often overlooked. 

As for 'social' advances the picture is also quite mixed. We tend to forget about things like the fact that in Rome was a slave state: a medieval serf was certainly less free than a Roman citizen, but had significantly more control over their own life and fate than a Roman slave. The extent of serfdom in both cases is pretty hard to determine: the Romans were already aggressively tying peasants (_coloni)_ to the land in the 3rd century, under Diocletian. On the other hand many ambitious medieval landlords (during the colonization of north-east Europe in the 12th and 13th century or after the Black Death in Italy, France and England) loosened restrictions on the peasantry to attract more workers. Rome generally had more social mobility before the 4th century, but after that assumed a very feudal-looking, hierarchical character. Rome -- the city, less so the Empire as a whole -- had a minimal form of welfare for its poorest citizens; but the medieval world set a far higher store on charity as a social ideal and social support systems were more widespread, if smaller. 

All that said, however, the two periods were still quite distinct. The really is one fundamental change behind the characteristic differences between, say 300 and 1300: medieval states were all __much smaller and much poorer__  than the Roman Empire.* 

They were smaller in land area -- they pretty much had to be since they were carved out of formerly Roman territory. In southern Europe they were also much less populous. France was probably more populous in the year 1000 than at any time under the empire (medieval agriculture was better than Roman agriculture in northern Europe) but southern Europe did not rebound with the same vigor. 

The net result was that these smaller medieval states -- even very powerful and well organized ones -- could never hope to marshal the kind of resources that the old Roman state had. The Romans could undertake mega-projects like aqueducts or the artificial harbor of [Portus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portus) because they could marshal resources from a vast area, including both a big labor force and a large, well developed set of technical specialists from all over the Mediterranean basin.

The most ambitious projects of the middle ages, on the other hand, were frequently hampered by recurrent financial crises and lack of resources: cathedrals and fortresses were often multi-generational efforts because even the wealthiest potentates could not find - or afford - enough labor to complete them in a single lifetime. 

Hand in hand with the smaller resources of the government was the difficulty of long-distance trade. Moving goods in the middle ages was more difficult, expensive and dangerous than it was under the empire. 

 The peak of Roman prosperity -- essentially the first and second centuries -- were the longest period in the entire history of the Mediterranean without large-scale warfare or piracy. The _mare nostrum_  was an astounding conduit of economic activity. Rome's gargantuan population (equivalent to the entire population of Great Britain at the same time!) was fed primarily by shipborne grain from Egypt and Africa; pottery, glass, and other bulk commodities could circulate effectively throughout the Mediterranean at affordable rates. On land, costs were much higher but at least there was a single, predictable customs regime stretching from Scotland to the Euphrates.

In contrast medieval transportation was far more fraught. The coasts of Spain and the southern shores of the Mediterranean (not to mention the Baltic and the North Sea before 1100 or so) were hostile territory, rife with piracy and unpredictable politics. The medieval quest for alternate routes to the East, which starts with overland travelers like Marco Polo, and ultimately ends with Columbus and Magellan) reflects how difficult and expensive it was to move good through the hostile Islamic world. Even in safe waters close to home the local political solution made it impossible to ship goods from one end of Europe to the other without dealing with multiple customs regimes and probably different local shipping monopolies:

The waterways and roads of Europe were festooned with _Zollburgen_  : "Toll castles" put up by local barons to exact a fee from passing commerce:

The mighty Roman road network also deteriorated badly. The roads had alway been primarily intended for government use: their primary users were armies and messengers, and trade was a secondary consideration. However maintaining them -- even though they were astonishingly well built -- was still an expensive task. During the years between 500 and 1000 a number of the roads fell out of regular use -- the other factors dampening long distance trade made them less important. Bridges collapsed and were often replaced by cheaper wooden or pontoon bridges -- again, medieval states did not have the lavish resources needed to build big, permanent infrastructure until the later middle ages.

All of this was a dismal contrast to the uniform transportation and politics of the Roman period, where people and goods moved much more freely and cheaply.

There were certainly losses on the technical side: the secret of Roman [waterproof cement](https://www.quora.com/What-lost-technologies-did-the-Ancient-Romans-use-but-now-they-have-been-rediscovered-and-improved), for example was lost until the 18th century, and medieval glass manufacture -- though very sophisticated -- never reached the [industrial scale](http://www.cmog.org/article/glass-romans) of the Roman era. Roman hydraulics was generally better than anything done before the 1500's -- the smaller cities of the middle ages didn't need the amazing Roman aqueducts. (There's some [scholarly debate](http://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Machine-Industrial-Revolution-Middle/dp/0140045147) about who made better use of water-power, however: it may be that the combination of a smaller workforce and the lack of slaves encouraged the middle ages to make more aggressive use of labor-saving technologies). However the technological losses and the economic changes are inextricably linked: without a market to sustain it a technology quickly becomes a dead letter, and in the fractured, pluralistic world of the middle ages it was much harder to implement the kind of ambitious projects we associate with Rome.

_* Strictly speaking Charlemagne's empire was probably on a par in terms of land area, since it actually included a lot of Germany which lay outside of the traditional Roman boundaries. However it only lasted in that configuration for a generation or so before splitting first into 3 and later into a bewildering host of smaller units._ 

_As for poverty: I'm thinking of 'ability to command labor', not weight of metal or even amount of food. Augustus' army, at 250,000 or so, was larger than the entire combined populations of medieval Rome, London and Paris._
