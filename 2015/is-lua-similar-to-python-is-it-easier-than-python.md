Python has really evolved from a 'scripting language' into a 'tools language': the wealth of excellent free libraries in the Python world makes it a very strong choice for a lot of applications which involve lots of disparate pieces talking to each other: reading xml files and trasmitting them to a database, or scraping web pages for data and making graphs, for example.

Lua is a still primarily a scripting language: it's light, fast, and simple, an excellent choice as an embedded language in a scriptable tool or game engine but not as useful for tasks that require interfacing with multiple type of data or lots of different applications and environments at once. 

In general, I wouldn't make a game scripting engine in Python or a web service in Lua. Both are possible, but neither is a great use of the respective toolkits.
