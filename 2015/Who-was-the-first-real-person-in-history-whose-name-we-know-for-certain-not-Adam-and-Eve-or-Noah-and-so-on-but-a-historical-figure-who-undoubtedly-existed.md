# Who was the first real person in history whose name we know for certain (not Adam and Eve or Noah and so on, but a historical figure who undoubtedly existed)?

This tablet from [Jemdet Nasr, Iraq (ancient Shurrupak)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemdet_Nasr_period) records the fact that a slave-owner named Gal-Sal owned two slaves, En-pap (?) and Sukkalgir some time before 3000 BC. 

This one from nearby Uruk (the city of Gilgamesh, the Biblical Erech) is probably a couple of hundred years older:

It's a receipt. It says "29,086 measures barley 37 months Kushim," - it's not clear if Kushim is a proper name or not - it might be a title. 

Another tablet from the same rough period (Just before 3000 BC) names an 'Enlil-ti' but I can't find a good picture. It would have been drawn as a star (the god Enlil) and an arrow (a homophone for 'life').
