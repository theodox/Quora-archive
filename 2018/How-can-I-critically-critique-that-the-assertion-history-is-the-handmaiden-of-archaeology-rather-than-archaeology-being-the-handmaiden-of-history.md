# How can I critically critique that the assertion history is the handmaiden of archaeology, rather than archaeology being the handmaiden of history?

Perhaps the most fruitful line to take is a critique of what’s implicit in both alternatives: the dubious idea that either one of these disciplines ought to be subordinated to the other.

By way of an analogy, consider how silly it would seem to ask police forces whether interviewing witnesses was the _real_  way to solve a crime, and looking at physical evidence was just a sort of minor supplement to the truths gained in the interrogation room — or, on the other hand, if only dusting for prints and taking DNA swabs was true crime-fighting, and all that stuff about asking people what they saw and heard is just a waste of time. Nobody who was seriously interested in actually solving crimes would be dismissive about either part of the process of investigation, even though differences in training and aptitude might make a given person better at one job or the other.

History and archaeology are complementary, not competitive. There will be occasions where one discipline or the other has more to contribute but ideally each approach can be a useful problem solving tool for the other, forcing people to reconsider their assumptions and to examine their data in light of a variety of different kinds of evidence.

Within the narrow confines of professional discussions there are some ways in which each discipline is independent. A deep knowledge of, say, cuneiform texts about astronomy doesn’t qualify a historian to correct an archaeologist's expertise in stratigraphy. An archaeologist who is very good at identifying different pottery techniques may not be good at spotting the literary references in a fragment of papyrus. However when the specialists are actually trying to make sense of the evidence in front of them they both do better by comparing notes and collaborating. One-upsmanship doesn’t do either field a service.
