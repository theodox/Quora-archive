# If I were to translate the famous quote of Monty Python 'What have the Romans ever done for us' to Latin, would 'Quid nobis Romani umquam fecerunt' be a good one?

I think I’d go with _Romani nobis aliquando quidquid fecerunt?_ 

_aliquando_  is less on-point than _umquam,_ it kind of depends on the emphasis. _umquam_ often goes with questions expecting a negative answer so it works well, but _aliquando_  is broader in terms of time so it’s stretching the point. It’s sort of like the difference between “did the Romans ever….?” (_unquam_ ) and “have the Romans ever…?” (_aliquando_ ). Either one will work, I’d think.

_quidquid_ is like “anything whatsoever”, so the clunky final sense is “whatever have the Romans at any time made for us” (_fac_ , is good, you could also use _ago_ but the sense of “making something that lasts” in _fac_ is good for the context).
