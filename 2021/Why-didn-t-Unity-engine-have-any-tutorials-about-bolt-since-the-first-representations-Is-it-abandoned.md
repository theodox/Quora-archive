“Bolt” the independent Asset Store package is now “Visual Scripting”, the built-in package. It’s definitely not abandoned — but the name change may be throwing you off (since a lot of people still use “Bolt” informally, it’s a bit more confusing that one could hope for too).

As far as learning material goes, the main in-house tutorial is [here](https://unity.com/products/unity-visual-scripting), and there’s a [Unity Learn course](https://learn.unity.com/project/introduction-to-visual-scripting?_ga=2.44490924.986891444.1636849318-2003982594.1636849318) here. The [The official forums for Visual Scripting](https://forum.unity.com/forums/visual-scripting.537/?_ga=2.58106658.986891444.1636849318-2003982594.1636849318) are pretty active as well, and several of the devs on the Visual Scripting team contribute to those discussions.

The official docs have enough information to work through if you’re more of a “read the manual” kind of learner. But if you’re looking for a video tutorial, you can follow along with this set, which is pretty simple:



There’s also a Udemy course here:
