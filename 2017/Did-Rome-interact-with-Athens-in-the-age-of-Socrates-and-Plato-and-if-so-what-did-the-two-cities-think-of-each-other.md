No.

It’s likely that somebody in Athens was aware of the existence of Rome, but in the generation of Plato and Aristotle Rome was still a middling-important city state with a low international profile. Rome only conquered Veii — about 10 miles away from the forum — a few years before the end of the Peloponnesian war. Plato and Socrates’ time coincided with a series of wars against the Latins and the Samnites, all very close to the city. Internally the city was still digesting the results of the conflict between the patricians and the plebeians.

The first Greek mention of Rome might go back as far as 420 BC. That is believed to be Antiochus of Syracuse, whose work is now lost. The earliest surviving direct reference is in [Hieronymus of Cardia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_of_Cardia), a contemporary of Alexander; he recorded the (mis-)adventures of Pyrrhus in Italy.

Interestingly [Aristotle discusses the constitution of Carthage](https://www.ancient.eu/article/193/aristotle-on-the-constitution-of-carthage-c-340-bc/) — being a major force in international trade, Carthage was much more familiar to Athenians; it didn’t hurt that Syracuse tried, not too successfully, to promote their victory over the Carthaginians at Himera as a western-Greek counterpart to Salamis and Plataea.
