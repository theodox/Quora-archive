_Miles_  was the conventional word for a soldier. It’s very Roman that the word shares an root with _[mille](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.11:1641.lewisandshort)_ _,_ the word for “thousands” — a soldier was, by definition, part of the unit and not an individual warrior but part of the unit. Most of the time there’s also an implicit contrast between the _miles_ , one of the thousands, and the _eques_ , the horseman who would always have been an aristocrat.

The root word of _munifex_  is _[munus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=munus)_ _,_ which means “duty” or “obligation” . A munifex is somebody who performs a service or undertakes a burden. Military service is a _munus —_ but so is putting on a gladiator show or organizing a festival (the association with lavish outlays of that sort is the origin of the English word “munificent”)

In some contexts, describing a _miles_  as a _munifex_  is something like calling a “soldier” as “serviceman.” However in the Roman army specialist roles — a medical corpsman or an artillerist, say — were known as _[immunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunes)_ or “excused from duty” because they did not have to do the ordinary labor of setting up camp or humping packs on the march.

Thus, a _munifex_  was the opposite of an _immunis:_ he was an ordinary grunt who had to dig ditches and carry a pack, not a specialist who didn’t have to get his hands dirty.
