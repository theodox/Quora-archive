This is a sealing ring (currently, housed in the [Kunsthistoriches Museum ](https://www.khm.at/en/)in Vienna). You’d press it into wax as a form of “signature”. If you do that, you get this:

Which says, in Latin, _ALARICUS REX GOTHORUM, “_ Alaric, King of the Goths”. It belonged to [Alaric II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_II), who reigned as king of the Visigoths from 484 to 507 in what’s now southern France. His kingdom was sometimes known as the _regnum Tolosanum,_ or “kingdom of Tolouse”, since that was where it was headquartered from 418 to 507. However, as you can see, the kings used the title _Rex Gothorum._ 

The Goths are as well documented as anything in Europe in the three or four centuries following the collapse of the western Roman empire. Since they played a leading role in creating that collapse, it’s only natural that Roman writers were interested in what the Goths were up to — though it’s certainly true that the information they had to work with was not always good. The east-Roman diplomat [Jordanes ](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jordanes)— himself of Gothic descent — left us a _[History of the Goths](https://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html)_ __ which he condensed out of a much longer (and, one hopes. more carefully compiled) work by [Cassiodorus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiodorus)in the 6th century. Cassiodorus himself worked for the (Ostro-)gothic King [Theodoric ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodoric_the_Great)who ruled Italy from 493 to 526. Meanwhile we also know a good deal about life under the Visigoths from the [many letters](https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/sidonius_letters_01book1.htm) of [Sidonius Appollinaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidonius_Apollinaris).

It’s hard to debate the existence of the Ostrogoths, since they left some remarkable and very large monuments, most notably the [Arian Baptistery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arian_Baptistery), [Theodoric’s tomb](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mausoleum-of-theoderic), and the amazing [Basilica of Saint Appolinaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Sant%27Apollinare_Nuovo) in Ravenna, the Ostrogothic capital. The Visigothic legacy in southern France is less visible — , but it was still impactful: it was Visigothic cavalry, allied with the last Roman army of the west, which [turned back Attila the Hun in 451](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Catalaunian_Plains).

The title “Rex Gothorum” might include a little politics. Theodoric the Ostrogoth was a Roman general as well as a barbarian king, and he made a great point of out of respecting Roman traditions as a ruler. Roman sources refer to Theodoric and his successors as _rex Gothorum,_ “king of the Goths”. This may have been a bit confusing, since of course his reign overlapped with that of the Alaric in southern France, whose house had used the title _rex Gothorum_  at least as far back as the 450’s. Perhaps that the title “king of the Goths” was aspirational for both rulers, since of course neither ruled all the Goths in the (former) western empire or any of the many who settled in the eastern empire. Theodoric the Ostrogoth, however, was much wealthier and more powerful than Alaric the Visigoth, so some contemporary sources like the [Anonymous Valesianus](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/valesianus2.html) distinguish Alaric as _Rex Uisigothorum,_ “king of the Visigoths.”

The Visigoths would eventually lose their place in France, and end up as the rulers of Spain instead. There they remained until they were eventually conquered by Islamic invaders in the 8th century. However they left a remarkable artistic legacy, such as the famous [Treasure of Guarrazar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_of_Guarrazar). Their legacy also lives on in Spanish names like Guzmán (Gutsman, in Gothic, is “good man”) , Rodrigo (Hrodric, “greatly renowned”), and Hermengildo (Ermengild, “great treasure”).

The “Gothic” script, incidentally, has nothing to do with the Goths. We have a very small number of Gothic texts, notably a [beautiful sixth century Gothic bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Argenteus), but apart from a few unique letters they look just like contemporary Roman Greek lettering. The name “Gothic” for the spiky, horizontally compressed handwriting of medieval texts was an insulting nickname given by Italian scholars in the Renaissance, who preferred more classical letterforms and looked down on the writing from the other side of the alps as “barbaric.”
