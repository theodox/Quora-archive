I'm with [Tim O'Neill](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-ONeill-1) on this one: technology is almost meaningless without a social, political and economic context. 

There's a couple of factual issues in the question. 



Latifundia - big industrial farms displacing small peasant holdings - really grew out of the combination of massive conquests and huge increases in the slave market after the final end of the Punic wars and the annexation of mainland Greece. Manorialization, if you want to call it that, was a separate development, owing much more to the combination of endless civil wars in the 3rd century, the anti-commercial, anti-urban impacts of militarization under Diocletian and his successors, and the way that plagues and famines hit urban centers harder than rural areas. 

 It's extremely unlikely that Chinese medical technology could have impacted this significantly; China suffered a bubonic plague outbreak as late as the 1890's . 

More efficient food production might have helped the population recover. The mouldboard plough is less likely to be the breakthrough tech here; the [Seed drill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_drill) is a better candidate. It's certainly true that the introduction of the seed drill in Europe in the 16th c did help set the stage for the Industrial Revolution by making agriculture more productive (the Chinese had seed drills starting around the 2d c, which helps explain some of the prosperity China had during the succeeding millennia). 

Junks are not particularly 'nautically efficient'. They're very well adapted to the winds and waters of east and especially southeast Asia, but pre-steam shipping varied very considerably based on locale: the classic British frigate of Nelson's time was supreme in the Atlantic but was awkward to maneuver and prone to being windbound in the Mediterranean, where old fashioned Xebecs remained important into the 19th century. 

In any case, the main obstacle to seaborne trade after the 7th century was not technology -- it was the fact the Mediterranean was a more or less permanent war zone, and would remain so until the 19th century.



I'd also add that during the years from the fall of the western empire in 476 and the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the rump Roman empire retained control of its own destiny (against a series of extremely formidable and inimical neighbors) except for the brief interlude of the Frankish empire, which lasted less than a century. During the same period China was subjugated by the [Khitans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitan_people), the [Jurchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurchen_people)s, and the Mongols, and just after that time it lost its independence again to the Manchus. Technology is a prop of power -- but it's not the same thing as power.
