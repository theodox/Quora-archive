Mesopotamian kings frequently claimed to be divine, but the differences between Mesopotamian divine kingship and the Egyptian variety are as important as the similarities.

Perhaps the most interesting difference is that we actually have some written records from before the time when Mesopotamian kings ruled as divinities. [Naram-Sin of Akkad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naram-Sin_of_Akkad) was the first Mesopotamian ruler to proclaim himself a god, sometime around 2230 BC. Before him, though, we have stories about kings who ruled as secular war-leaders and judges; stories like [Gilgamesh and Aga](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1811.htm) recall a time when kings had to cajole and wheedle with a council of elders rather than simply ruling by fiat.

Mesopotamian pre-history was dominated originally by what’s known as the “temple-state,” where the priestly hierarchy controlled most of the land and organized the economy (often, in excruciatingly minute detail). It was only in the later half of the third millennium BC, when conflicts between the different Mesopotamian cities and incursions by outside groups became common, that semi-permanent military leaders began to displace temple bureaucrats as the dominant force in Mesopotamian society; this transition is usually known as the [Early Dynastic Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Dynastic_Period_(Mesopotamia)) because it showcases the rise of ruling families, which was largely unknown in earlier centuries.

After Naram-Sin it became increasingly common for rulers to claim divine honors. However it’s probably fair to say that the claims were rather less grandiose. Mesopotamian kings functioned (or claimed to function ) as protectors of the poor against the rich and powerful; their sponsorship of written law codes and social welfare programs reflected the importance of popular support. This made it rather harder for Mesopotamian kings to disguise their practical political position entirely behind a facade of theological glory. The recurrent fragmentation of Mesopotamia into smaller city states made it clear that the God-king of, say, Mari was not necessarily much of a divinity in Kish or Lagash — in later times Babylonian chronicles recorded in detail how “kingship passed” from one city to another as empires and dynasties rose and fell. Egypt certainly had internal and external conflicts too, but it was far easier to maintain the fiction of unchanging eternal order in the safe and comparatively orderly Nile Valley than in the turbulent, conflict-ridden land of the two rivers. Even on the natural level, Mesopotamia was more unpredictable: a Pharaoh rarely saw his divine credentials undermined by a flood or drought but the Tigris and Euphrates could be very unpredictable and dangerous.

So: yes, Mesopotamian kings ruled as gods, but the theological and politcal tenor of their position was very different.
