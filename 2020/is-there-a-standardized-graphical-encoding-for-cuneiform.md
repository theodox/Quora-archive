Yes, there’s a cuneiform block in the Unicode standard - it’s documented here: [Cuneiform (Unicode block)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_(Unicode_block))

There are a variety of fonts available representing different “flavors” of cuneiform, which did have several different aesthetics over its long and varied life. A few of them are collected here: [http://cuneifyplus.arch.cam.ac.uk](http://cuneifyplus.arch.cam.ac.uk)
