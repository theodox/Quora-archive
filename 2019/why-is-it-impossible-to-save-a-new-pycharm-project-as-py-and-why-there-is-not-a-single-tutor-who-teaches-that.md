# Why is it impossible to save a new 'PyCharm' project as .py and why there is not a single tutor who teaches that?

‘pycharm projects’ are just the information that Pycharm uses to help you write code.

The actual code files are `.py` files and those, of course, are save-able.

Pycharm project files — there are a bunch — are saved in to a `.idea` folder ; they contain information like what project interpreter you have set up, debugging preferences and so on.

The [ordinary Jetbrains tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-running-your-first-python-project.html) does a decent job of walking you through a basic project setup. If you follow that one and then check the files on disk you should be able to see how it’s laid out.
