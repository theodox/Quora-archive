It’s [also been suggested](http://www.lotrplaza.com/archives/index.php?Archive=First%20Age&TID=169800) that the name is a deliberate echo of the name of [Theodoric I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodoric_I), king of the Visigoths, who was allied with Rome. Theodoric[ died in battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Catalaunian_Plains) fighting alongside [Flavius Aetius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavius_Aetius) against Attila the Hun at Chalons in 451.

It’s an easy fit — the semi barbarous horse king rides to the rescue of his decadent civilized allies and dies in battle against a fierce and unstoppable horde… Tolkien in professional life was interested in the historical [Gothic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_language), and one of the few ancient sources for that language is the [Getica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getica) of Jordanes:[ our main source for the battle of Chalons](http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/451jordanes38.asp).
