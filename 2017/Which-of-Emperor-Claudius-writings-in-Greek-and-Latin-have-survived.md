None of his literary works survive, but we generally believe that the [Lyon Tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon_Tablet) is an accurate record of his speech to the Senate in which he advocated opening the order up to Roman citizens in Gaul. The text accords pretty well with the summary given by Tacitus and is in the first person.
