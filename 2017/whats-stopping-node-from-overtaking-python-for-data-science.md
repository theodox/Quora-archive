In addition to the infrastructure issues mentioned in other answers, I suspect a lot of math and science oriented users will shy away from some JS language features. Very… generous… scoping and silent type coercion are even more unsettling to a scientific computing application than they are to ordinary users, and — unlike the more flexible world of web development — confer no plusses in this context.
