There are a couple of things which play into it -- [Assaph Mehr](https://www.quora.com/profile/Assaph-Mehr) mentions some good ones -- but the most important is the fact that Marcus Junius Brutus was a celebrity. Decimus was just another Roman politician. (He was also a second cousin of Caesar, which is most likely to the reason for his appearance in the will. The main heir, of course, was [Octavian](http://www.roman-empire.net/emperors/augustus.html)).

Marcus Brutus' reputation in life and particularly after death was that of a noble, self-denying philosopher. Plutarch's biography gives a pretty good flavor of what kind of 'press' Brutus got:



> ...this Brutus, whose life we now write, having to the goodness of his disposition added the improvements of learning and the study of philosophy, and having stirred up his natural parts, of themselves grave and gentle, by applying himself to business and public affairs, seems to have been of a temper exactly framed for virtue; insomuch that they who were most his enemies upon account of his conspiracy against Caesar, if in that whole affair there was any honourable or generous part, referred it wholly to Brutus, and laid whatever was barbarous and cruel to the charge of Cassius, Brutus's connection and familiar friend, but not his equal in honesty and pureness of purpose.. 


It is of course difficult to know how accurate the romantic portrayal of Brutus really is. For example, he is alleged to have enriched himself through loan-sharking during his term as a Roman legate on Cyprus -- though, given the way [many late Republican governors carried on,](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Cic.%20Ver.%202.4&lang=original) mere usury was comparatively humane. 

On the whole, though, he was venerated. As one of the last heroes of the Republic, he was a figure for uncritical admiration among any later Romans who mourned the death of the old Roman state (much the same thing happened to his brother-in-law [Cato](http://Cato)). Nevertheless Brutus' rep was pretty good among both friends and enemies. Even Marc Antony, who was given to vindictiveness, treated Brutus' remains with chivalrous respect after Philippi.

Another reason for Brutus' aura of glamor was the fact that he was -- notionally, at least -- descended from the [the original Brutus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Junius_Brutus), the legendary founder of the Roman republic and the original tyrannicide.

If all that together were not enough to make the Brutus-Caesar relationship a great candidate for drama... well, there have been pretty persistent speculations for the last two thousand years that [Caesar was actually Brutus' father](http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/caesarpeople/f/CaesarBrutus.htm). His mother, Servilia, was the closest thing Caesar (a notorious womanizer) had to a life-long lover. The dates are dubious -- if Caesar really was Brutus' father, the boy was born when Caesar was about 16 -- but not impossible. The popularity of the rumor lends the whole relationship a soap-opera air that subsequent readers have always found irresistible. The fact that Brutus was the son of Caesar's lover -- and also the the son-in-law of his arch-enemy Cato, who was himself Servilia's half-brother.
