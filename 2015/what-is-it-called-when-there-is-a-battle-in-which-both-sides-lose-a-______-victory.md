It's 'Pyrrhic', for this guy, [Pyrrhus "the Eagle" of Epirus](http://www.livius.org/ps-pz/pyrrhus/pyrrhus01.html):

 Pyrrhus fought the Romans in southern Italy in 280 BC. He had a fully equipped, modern Hellenistic army, complete with elephants.

He beat the Romans in two costly battles, but he was dismayed by Roman determination and also by Italy's large reserves of manpower. After the second battle at[ Asculum ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Asculum_(279_BC))(279) he moved on to easier pickings in Sicily, remarking "Another victory like _that_  and we are ruined".
