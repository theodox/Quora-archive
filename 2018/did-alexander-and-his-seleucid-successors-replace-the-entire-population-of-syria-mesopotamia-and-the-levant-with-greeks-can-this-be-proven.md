___Definitely___  not.

There is a lot of evidence for the continuity of the different populations of the region after Alexander — there’s so much, in fact, that it’s hard to lay it all out in detail.

However here are some of the obvious highlights of non-Hellenic cultural activity between the time of Alexander and the Arab conquest:

__Native languages and literatures.__ 

The most obvious example of a pre-Greek literary culture that continues to survive and flourish in Mesopotamia and Syria after Alexander is the __[Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_language)__ tradition, which survives today in a number of forms from Iran to Israel. The largest descendant of Aramaic is____ __[Modern Assyrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_Neo-Aramaic)__ __,__ the language of the Assyrian minority in Iraq whose oral and written tradition The __[Syriac language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_language)__  is primarily a liturgical language today but it too is a direct development of the Aramaic that was spoken in Syria and the the Levant in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Aramaic was a hugely successful language family even in the Roman period: there are examples from as far apart in space and time as Roman Britain and Hellenistic Bactria.

_Detail of_ _[a funeral inscription in Latin and Palmyrene Aramaic for the wife of Barates, the Palmyrene](https://romaninscriptionsofbritain.org/inscriptions/1065)_ _, from Durham, England._ 

Most of the surviving Aramaic literature of this period — as opposed to inscriptions — comes from Jewish communities. The older parts of the Jewish __[Talmud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud#History)__  were written down in Aramaic (sometimes in Judea, sometimes in Babylonia) after the destruction of Jerusalem in the year 70, but they reflect the oral traditions of the Jewish communities in both areas going back at least two or three centuries before Alexander. In a secular context there’s also the Jewish historian __[Josephus’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus)__  account of the same war, which he originally wrote in Aramaic (although the surviving text is in Greek).

Once we get to the second century, however we have a [large number of Syriac sources](http://syri.ac/), both sacred and secular, in both the Roman and the Parthian/Sassanian territories. Syriac writers in Syria claim descent from the ancient Arameans. Syriac writers in Mesopotamia claim descent from the Assyrians. Syriac literature spread as far east as China with the spread of the Nestorian flavor of Christianity, which originated in Syria but ended up nearly extinct there: the cross-border literary culture of the Nestorians made them somewhat suspect in the eyes of both their Roman and Persian rulers.

_A_ _[Nestorian inscription from China](https://daleinchina.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/syriac-names-on-a-chinese-monument/)_ _, in Syriac and Chinese, dated “in the year of the Greeks 1092”, using the Seleucid calendar._ 

However Syriac was not only a Christian language: __[Bardaisan,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardaisan)__  the most important early Gnostic thinker, wrote in Syriac. Significantly he was also an expert in Babylonian astronomy as well as philosophy.

There are also some __Akkadian__  sources, although these are less numerous. However some of them clearly show that the Seleucids were not interested in genocide: for example the [Antiochus Cylinder](http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/antiochus_cylinder/antiochus_cylinder1.html) records the dedication of a temple of Nabu in Borsippa by [Antiochus I Soter](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/antiochus-i-soter/) in 268 BC.

Akkadian cuneiform did fade out over the Seleucid period; the last known cuneiform text dates from 75 AD. However the [Babylonian reputation for expertise in astronomy and astrology remained throughout the Hellenistic and Roman periods](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/kidinnu-the-chaldaeans-and-babylonian-astronomy/). For example the Greek geographer Strabo had this to say in the first century BC:

> In Babylon a settlement is set apart for the local philosophers, the Chaldaeans, as they are called, who are concerned mostly with astronomy; but some of these, who are not approved of by the others, profess to be writers of horoscopes. (There is also a tribe of the Chaldaeans, and a territory inhabited by them, in the neighborhood of the Arabs and of the Persian Gulf, as it is called.) There are also several tribes of the Chaldaean astronomers. For example, some are called Orcheni [those from Uruk], others Borsippeni [those from Borsippa], and several others by different names, as though divided into different sects which hold to various different dogmas about the same subjects. And the mathematicians make mention of some of these men; as, for example, Cidenas [Kidinnu], Naburianus [Nabû-rîmannu] and Sudine

_Strabo, Geography 16.1–6_ 

__Greek literature.__ 

The snippet from Strabo, of course, clearly shows the ongoing presence of Babylonians in their own homeland. But there are also examples of non-Greeks writing in Greek about their native cultures in the Hellenistic and Roman periods . Unfortunately we have only a handful of these works in their entirety, but we do have fragments of __[Berossus the Babylonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berossus)__  and __[Philo of Byblos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byblos)__ , who both wrote during the Hellenistic period. You could also include the works of the Egyptian [Manetho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho) and the Jewish philosopher [Philo of Alexandria](http://www.iep.utm.edu/philo/) as examples of Greek-language literature by colonized peoples in the Hellenistic world.

In the Roman period the well known Syrian writer __[Lucian of Samosata,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian)__  who archly described himself as “a barbarian” was a native speaker of Aramaic who learned Greek later in life although he became a master of Greek prose. The Neoplatonic philosopher __[Porphyry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyry_(philosopher))__  was a similar case — born in Tyre with the Phoenician name Malchus. Although the Seleucid ruling class was Greek-speaking, some of the examples above show that a Greek-sounding name does not necessarily indicate a Greek ethnic origin.*

__Archeology__ 

Again, there’s a lot of evidence to consider; it’s very hard to pick.

For a good metaphorical example you could consider the case of the Seleucid fortress of __[Dura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura-Europos)__ , founded about twenty years after Alexander’s death to guard a caravan route along the Euphrates. Although it was created exclusively to house a Macedonian garrison, the fortress quickly accumulated a town, which became a prosperous city with a very mixed population. From its founding until it was abandoned in the middle of the third century Dura housed speakers of Greek, Hebrew, several versions of Aramaic, [Palmyrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyrene_dialect), Arabic, Persian and eventually Latin. The city included Greco-Roman temples, but also a very Hellenistic-looking synagogue and Syrian temples, all of which borrowed motifs from one anotherˆ. In art-history circles Dura is almost a synonym for the complex mix of cultures in the Greco-Roman Near East.

_The Greek text on this plague from Dura reads: Hadadiabos son of Zabdibolos and grandson of Sillos dedicated this structure of the temple of Aphlad, who is called god of the village Anath on the Euphrates, as a vow for his own salvation and that of his children and his entire household.

However the most famous and spectacular example of the coexistence of Hellenistic and Syrian culture is the city of __[Palmyra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra)__ . This trading city in the Syrian desert was a nominal part of both the Seleucid and Roman empires at times, but for all practical purposes it remained in local hands. The continuity is well demonstrated by the fact that it retained — and still retains — its ancient name of _Tadmor,_ first attested in cuneiform tablets from the 18th century BC. In the Hellenistic period the city spoke a dialect of Aramaic and wrote with its own unique script, although the ruling dynasty could adopt Greek language and cultural trappings when it was convenient.

As a cultural and commercial entrepot, Palmyra reflected a dizzying array of different traditions; the city included every kind of deity from ancient Mesopotamian ([Nabu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabu)) to Canaanite ([Baalshamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baalshamin)) to Arab ([Al-Lat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Lat)).

_A Palmyrene statue of Al-Lat, the Arabian goddess, done in the finest Hellenistic style modeled after an Attic Athena . Photo:_ _[Marco Prins](http://www.livius.org/contributor/marco-prins/)_ 

It’s interesting to note that the dedication of the largest temple in Palmyra, to Bel — who may be the Mesopotamian [Bel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bel_(mythology)) or a Canaanite [Baal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal) — uses the Seleucid dating system as a reference (just like the Nestorians in China would, six hundred years later).

__Some famous names__ 

The most famous Palmyrene was the warrior-queen __[Zenobia](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-Zenobia)__ , who briefly conquered Roman Egypt in the third century; Zenobia is a Greek name but her given name was the Aramaic Bat-Zabbai. She perfectly embodied the cultural synthesis of Palmyra, speaking Greek, Latin and Coptic in addition to Palmyrene. She claimed (on flimsy evidence) to be descended from Cleopatra of Egypt. Her chief court intellectual was __[Cassius Longinus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassius_Longinus_(philosopher))__  a Syrian from Emesa with a Roman name and a penchant for Plato who lived most of his life in Athens. Her coins were inscribed in Latin, and featured the Syrian goddess [Atargatis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atargatis) done up as _Juno Regina_ , the Roman queen of the gods.†

Speaking of powerful Syrian women, a good place to end is the career of __[Julia Domna,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Domna)__  a Roman empress of Syrian origin. Her family were the hereditary priest-kings of [Emesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homs#Emesani_dynasty_and_Roman_rule), modern Homs. They were also enormously wealthy, which made her an attractive catch for Roman emperor [Septimius Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus).° Thus the entire __[Severan dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severan_dynasty)__ of the Roman empire was part-Syrian. The infamous bad-boy Severan emperor [Elagabalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus) got his name from the deity which Julia Domna’s family, served — and he scandalized Roman society by importing the cult to Rome and elevating it above the traditional Olympian rites.‡

_Coin of Elagalabus, showing the Stone of Emesa being brought to Rome._ 

On the other hand his successor, [Severus Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severus_Alexander), is the only emperor between Claudius and Julian who could be described as philosemitic; he is said [to have returned the Torah scrolls looted by Titus to the Jewish community of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severus_Scroll). This might reflect his connections to the semitic world of Syria.

In any event, the story of the Severans clearly shows the ongoing prosperity of the native Syrian people and culture through the Roman era.±

__TLDR__ 

So, to sum up: __no, Alexander did not depopulate the Levant, Syria, or Mesopotamia__ . There’s plenty of evidence for the ongoing coexistence of the new Hellenic population (concentrated mostly in big cities) and the indigenous population. No genocide here.

* During this period there were Jewish High Priests in Jerusalem with names like [Jason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_(high_priest)) and [Menelaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menelaus); the biblical Herod was an Edomite by ethnicity and a Jew by religion, but his children included a Philip, an Archelaos, and an Antipas.

ˆ Dura also hosted one of the oldest identified churches in the world. Another example of the Hellenistic-Mesopotamian cultural milieu is [Hatra](http://judithweingarten.blogspot.nl/2015/03/elegy-for-hatra.html) in Iraq — another treasure ruined by ISIS vandalism.

† We know that Atargatis is Juno thanks to Lucian of Samosata’s [The Syrian goddess](https://archive.org/details/syriangoddessbei00luciuoft)

° It’s interesting to speculate that Severus, who grew up speaking Punic, had an affinity for Semitic Syrian culture as well.

‡ The cult object was a black meteoric stone, which he had installed on the Capitol. Elagalabus was circumcised, an attribute that official Rome liked even less than his penchant for cross-dressing.

± Third century Syria produced a _lot_  of strong women: besides Julia Domna and Zenobia, Severan queen mothers [Julia Maesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Maesa), [Julia Soaemias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Soaemias), mother of [Elagabalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus), and [Julia Avita Mamaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Avita_Mamaea) were all at least as powerful as their imperial sons.
