It is usually assumed among scholars that Thucydides' speeches are not verbatim transcripts, although some readers believe that short bits or especially vivid phrases (such as Pericles' "Athens is the school of Greece") might be literal quotations.

The standard practice of most ancient historians was to put speeches into their character's mouths where a modern historian would have written an analytical essay in the third person. Unfortunately for us there is no obvious marker to distinguish between "I am using this character as a standin for my own analysis" and "I chose this character in particular because he is the main spokesman for this position at this time".

Thus, it is not easy to tell whether Archidamos' worries about going to war with Athens are a stand-in for a detached summary of the situation, provided for the readers by Thucydides, or represent Archidamos leading opposition to the war party in Sparta or at least as the main voice of a patient long term strategy.

My own guess in this case would be both. Thucydides is usually pretty consistent in portraying the Spartans as cautious: it may be important for him to make sure that this portrayal does not get glossed over in the lead up to the war. The war did, of course, turn out to be long and bitter and Thucydides - always the student of statesman-like balancing acts - would want to highlight the gravity of the decision to fight for his readers, no matter what was actually said in council. On the other hand, it's not unreasonable to think that Archidamos was in fact the leading exponent of a cautious approach to war with Athens -- it's certainly not uncommon for Spartan kings to have different agendas from each other and the ephors. Thucydides had some limited contacts in Sparta; it seems reasonable to assume he had good reason to cast Archidamos in a specific role as an advocate of caution rather than as a firebrand.

Unfortunately, there's not competing source material we can use to judge, so the strongest readings will have to come from an overall theory about how Thucydides composed his work. For myseld, I think he uses speeches for exposition, rather than documentation, so they are only 100% reliable indicators of things that he felt were in play (obviously, he puts different points of view into the mouths of different characters so its not wise to attribute any of their opinions directly to him). The speeches tell us "Thucydides believes this faction at this time had this general outlook" for sure. Beyond that it's very much guesswork.
