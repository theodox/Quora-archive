Unfortunately, this is the hardest part: the technical and artistic challenges of making a game are simple in comparison to getting your game noticed.

Some things you can do to help:

__Networking.__  The indie game community can be a bit clannish, but if you get the attention of influential indie game creators or bloggers that helps a lot. If you're in a place with a lot of other developers, look for meetups or social groups you can befriend -- even if this doesn't sell any copies you'll pick up useful information and you may attract the notion of somebody who can get you in good with popular bundlers or bring your game to the attention of influential bloggers or youtubers.

__Research.__  Find out whatever you can about the kind of people who play your kind of game. Every hit starts with a smaller fan-base with niche tastes and grows outward -- if you don't have zillions of marketing dollars you can't win by targeting "everybody". Strategy games and adventures, puzzlers and platformers, 4X games and art games -- to name just a few -- all have different communities. If you can find where "your kind" of gamer is hanging out -- which websites, forums, IRC channels or hashtags -- you'll have a big headstart on building word of mouth. Don't limit yourself to gamers only. If your game has a hook to some non-games community, whether it's motorcycle race fans or tropical fish collectors or Peruvians -- get into online communities there as well and let people know. Folks whose interests are underserved by the traditional game market are often _very_  enthusiastic about games in their areas.

__Create a community.__ As [Timothy Hartkorn](https://www.quora.com/profile/Timothy-Hartkorn) says, getting a bunch of fans in one place creates a lot of energy. Engage with people (probably people you found via 'research' ) in ways that make them feel like they have some investment in the game before it comes out: discuss ideas, take suggestions (even if you can't implement them you can certainly kick the ideas around: it's a great way to get fans feeling that you want them to have fun). This lets you benefit from their feedback, gives them good feelings about your project and creates a whole group of people who are happy to spread the word for you.

 __Be creative__ . Guerilla marketing is hard, but it can be very effective. A funny youtube series, a clever giveaway, or a compelling developer story that makes it onto social media can do a lot for your profile.

__Stay hopeful.__ It's really hard to get noticed. Indifference is the normal state of the world, moving people to be interested in your project is like starting a band or asking a lot of strangers on dates: you can't be too paralyzed by rejections, just shrug it off and keep moving. It's not you, it's them.
