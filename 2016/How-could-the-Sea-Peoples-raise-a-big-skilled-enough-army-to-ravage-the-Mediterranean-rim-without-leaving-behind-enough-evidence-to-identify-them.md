# How could the Sea Peoples raise a big/skilled enough army to ravage the Mediterranean rim without leaving behind enough evidence to identify them?

There's a couple of ways to look at it.

__Attackers__ 

From the perspective of the attackers, it's not entirely inconceivable for a fairly small number of motivated -- and above all, aggressive -- attackers to cause harm that's disproportionate to their numbers. 

There are plenty of examples from earlier and later history of less-settled groups defeating supposedly 'superior' civilizations with a combinations of ruthlessness and mobility: Like the Huns or the Mongols, you can wreak a lot of havok on societies that seem, on paper, to have all sorts of advantages as long as your warriors are able to live and fight on what they loot from the enemy -- those fields, after all, aren't going to move but your forces can. And all of your gains are losses to the other side, who somehow has to continue feeding and housing civilians and who also has to retain political legitimacy.

 If you have no ambition to settle down and actually take permanent possession you can field an army as big as a much larger, settled society full of disarmed peasants, craftspeople and other non-combatants. You may not have a big siege train -- but you can often steal one, along with the specialists needed to operate it -- as you go. It isn't really until the rise of firearms -- where technological advantages can translate into a significant jump in relative lethality for the forces of 'civilization' -- that settled peoples earned a decisive advantage over nomads and bandits.

Anecdotally, anyway, the Sea Peoples may have used their boats in much the same way as the Mongols used horses: they could appear without warning and attack cities that were unable to prepare for their arrival. The last king of [Ugarit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugarit) wrote desperately for help to Cyprus

> My father, behold, the enemy's ships came (here); my cities(?) were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots(?) are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka?...Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.

The land of Lukka is probably [Lycia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycia) in southwest Turkey -- this may suggest something like an organized anti-piracy campaign by Ugarit, since the southern coast of Asia Minor was a proverbial pirate's den all they way until Pompey the Great cleared it out in the 60's BC.

__Defenders__  

From the perspective of the defenders there's also the problem of resiliency. The loss of a single battle is not usually enough to destroy an entire civilization. However different kinds of societies show very different levels of resistance: The Romans, for example, were able to basically out-last Hannibal, who roamed the Italian peninsula for 15 (!) years: the [Fabian strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_strategy) of waiting it out worked because they had an extraordinary level of discipline and unusually strong links with their core allies. The Persian empire, on the other hand, was basically decapitated by Alexander's defeat of Darius at [Issus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Issus) : had the Persians had more resilient institutions their vast empire should have been able to outlast Alexander's much smaller force even despite it's tactical advantages.

Complex societies are, like complex machines, much more susceptible to breakdown. It's much easier to starve a city that depends on trade than a community of peasant farmers; it's easier to disrupt the workings of a highly stratified, caste-ridden society than those of a tribe with simple institutions. The [Palace economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_economy) which were common in the late Bronze Age were highly centralized and run by a small cadre of specialists (among other things, they depended on literacy and accounting skills that were confined to a tiny slice of the population).

 _A Linear B tablet accounting for bathtubs. The Palace economies where highly centralized, and thus vulnerable to decapitation:_ _[Linear B and production and consumption](http://www.bronzeage.org.uk/8.aspx)_ 

If attackers could disrupt those small sections of the populace those societies were poorly placed to rebuild. This seems most clearly to be the case in Mycenaean Greece, where the prosperous palace centers of the 13th century BC seem never to have recovered from the invasions that happened between 1200 and 1150 BC: more 9 out of every 10 were simply abandoned and eventually forgotten. In the Levant the job of rebuilding seems to have mostly been led by people from the interior: the [Arameans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arameans) , who lived inland, were better positioned to repopulate and re-civilize the coasts. But even there it took a long time, since the vibrant international economy of the late Bronze Age had been thoroughly disrupted and took centuries to reach its Bronze Age peak again.



On top of all there there are theories -- hard to prove or disprove -- that this period suffered from climate change or volcanic eruptions which disrupted the delicate balance of these finely tuned economies and societies. If true these theories certainly exaggerate the impact of the perennial competition between settled societies and mobile ones.
