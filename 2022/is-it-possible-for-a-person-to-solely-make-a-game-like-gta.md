Define “like”.

If you’re focused on production values, then it’s highly unlikely: GTA is a _very_ labor intensive franchise. I’ve worked on games where the entire team was smaller than just the group who painted the terrain on GTA V. GTA was one of the first games produced outside of Japan with more than a thousand contributors.

But if you are focused on the crazy crime sandbox do-it-your-way vibe, then one man can do it — to wit, [Brian Provenzano](https://twitter.com/briprov?lang=en), the developer of [Retro City Rampage](https://store.steampowered.com/app/204630/Retro_City_Rampage_DX/). This game is game frequently described as “GTA in 8 bits.” More [recent iterations of the game have included some art and music contributions from other individuals](https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/retro-city-rampage-dx/credits) (9 artists and sound folks and about a dozen playtesters) but I believe the original was as close to a solo effort as you’re ever going to see.
