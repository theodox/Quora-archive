If you’re just getting started, consider [Source Filmmaker](http://www.sourcefilmmaker.com/) — it’s free and has a large community so you’ll have no trouble finding advice and tutorials. Plus — unlike most software — it comes with a lot of existing models (granted, they usually come from Team Fortress II, so they are not equally applicable to all situations!) so you can get to work animating without having to learn how to model and texture a character too.

If you are interested in seeing the whole process from start to finish, including how models are created, how scenes are lit and composed, and how special effects are done try [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), which is also free. Blender has roughly the same feature set as professional software — without the pricetag.
