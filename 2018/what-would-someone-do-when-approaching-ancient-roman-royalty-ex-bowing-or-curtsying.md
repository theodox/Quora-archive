For the Roman kingdom (before 509 BC) we don’t have much to go on. Roman tradition depicted the kings — or at least, the later ones — as arrogant: the last king was Taquinius Superbus, “Tarquin the Proud” so you can assume that his manners were unlikely to be affable and democratic. However beyond that it’s mostly guesswork: no authentic accounts from that period survive. We do know that the king was accompanied in public by 12 [Lictors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lictor) — bodyguards armed with rods and axes that symbolized the right to punish or to execute. These were responsible for keeping common people away from the him — pushing them aside in a crowd, for example — and would only allow access with the king’s consent.

The imperial period began as a phony continuation of the Republic; the first few emperors generally affected to be nothing more than Roman aristocrats. In a civilian setting, therefore, there was no special behavior expected. At least in the beginning a social “equal” — a man of the Senatorial or equestrian class — could offer a handshake:

Somebody of lower status, however, probably would not. It’s not clear if a woman could do the same — the only depictions of men and women shaking hands are from weddings.

With close associates, Romans would offer an _osculum,_  a “kiss” — something like the Mediterranean ‘ear kiss’ or cheek-touch of today. This was also a part of the etiquette for a client paying their respects to a patron — the kiss could be exchanged with somebody of lower or higher status but not with a stranger. The emperors would offer the kiss to favored friends as a mark of public favor (when socially awkward Tiberius banned the custom, it was seen as proof of his arrogance; on the other hand emperors like Nero or Otho who were very free with their kisses were regarded as tacky). It’s probably safe to bet that the kiss was expected to be initiated by the emperor, but that’s not directly attested.

Social inferiors are frequently reported as kissing the hands of their superiors (soldiers, for example, might do this to an officer when expressing deep thanks or making abject request). It’s likely that an emperor might expect something like that from an inferior, particularly someone coming to beg a favor, though it’s not explicitly recorded as regular etiquette.

_The kiss of the hand in supplication survives today_ 

Another way for a lower status person to beseech favor was the gesture of _supplicatio_ ; falling to ones knees and beseeching with both arms raised. This is a gesture of desperation, and would not be used for ordinary occasions. However many lower-status persons approaching the emperor would be in precisely this kind of dire need.

_supplicatio_ 

Incidentally, the stiff armed “Roman salute” is [a modern invention](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-ancient-Romans-use-the-straight-armed-salute-as-asserted-by-the-Fascists-and-later-by-the-Nazis/answer/Steve-Theodore). We don’t know what, if any, gestures Roman soldiers might have used to acknowledge a superior as a matter of routine.

As the empire became increasingly autocratic, the charade of Roman Republican equality was finally abandoned. Eventually they began to expect the same gestures of respect offered to the gods. The first emperor to demand this was Caligula, but he gave the practice rather a bad name and it was not repeated, as far as we know, until the middle of the third century. It had definitively [become obligatory by the time of Diocletian](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-the-first-Roman-emperor-that-demanded-people-to-bow-before-him) in the late third century. Protocol became increasingly strict: within a few decades of Diocletian the formal gestures of worship were[ required even from relatives of the emperor](http://kuouohttps://books.google.com/books?id=sE4Ufw6QgbQC&lpg=PA314&dq=roman%20proskynesis&pg=PA314#v=onepage&q=roman%20proskynesis&f=false)

Exactly what gestures were involved changed over time. The old Republican Roman practice of _adoratio_ or “worship” was to cover your head with a fold of your toga, kiss your right hand, and turn in place (in less formal circumstances the kiss of the hand was enough). As time wore on the Romans adopted the Greek practice of _[proskynesis](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/proskynesis/)_ _,_  a broad term term for “obeisance” which could involve bowing, kneeling, or prostrating yourself. In the fourth century the mode seems to have been a bow of the head and a kiss of the hand similar to the old Roman manner. In the fifth century, high officials were allowed to take hold of the hem of the emperor’s robe and kiss it — this was a privilege, since actual physical contact with the emperor was by that point very strictly limited. Others were expected to drop to a knee (the Latin for this, _genu flexu_ , “on bended knee,” gives us our _genuflect)._

By the time of Justinian in the sixth century even Roman Senators had to literally kiss the foot of the emperor — and the empress, which Justinian’s enemy Procopius found scandalous) in court settings.
