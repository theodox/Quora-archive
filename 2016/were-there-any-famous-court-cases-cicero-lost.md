It's worth noting that a lawyer's 'score sheet' in the last generation of the Republic was not necessarily just an index of skill: Cicero's career peaked just as the Roman Republic slid into anarchy and civil war, with street-fights between rival factions, the triumvirate running the government behind the scenes, and eventually open war, proscriptions, and political terror.

That said:

Cicero's most significant loss was his defence of the political thug [Titus Annius Milo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Annius_Milo) on a charge of murdering the killing a rival political gangster, [Publius Clodius Pulcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Clodius_Pulcher) . Milo led a street gang allied with the _optimates_ , the aristocratic faction in the Senate; Clodius led the _popularis_  gangs. Clodius was killed by Milo's partisans in what seemed like an unplanned street affray in 52 BC.

Cicero -- who himself had been driven into exile by the same Clodius in 58 BC -- was happy to defend the man who had been the main opposition to Clodius' violent career, even though Milo wasn't much of a saint either.

However the trial was conducted under the threat of riots from Clodius' remaining supporters. Pompey, who had a tacit alliance with Milo during his own conflicts with Clodius, was serving as 'sole consul' to secure public order during the aftermath of the murder and seems to have wanted a conviction as a way of declaring that accounts were 'even' and neither side had a grievance that could spark more violence.

Cicero led the defense team. However his defense didn't live up to his reputation. We have a very eloquent written speech, which survives as the _[Pro Milone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Milone)_ -- but evidently it is a big improvement over what he actually said in court, being intimidated and harassed by a hostile Clodian crowd.

Milo was convicted and fled to exile in Massillia. Milo, in exile, joked on reading the transcription that he would never have been convicted had Cicero's court-room delivery been as good as the re-written version that has circulated ever since.



It's not known if the Gnaeus Plancius Cicero defended in the [Pro Plancio ](https://www.loebclassics.com/view/marcus_tullius_cicero-pro_plancio/1923/pb_LCL158.405.xml)was acquitted or not, though he turns up later living in Corcyra which would be consistent with conviction and exile.



As the other answer notes Cicero unsuccessfully defended his co-Consul, the rather sleazy [Gaius Antonius Hybrida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Antonius_Hybrida) on a corruption charge. Cicero owed Hybrida a big debt for his support during the [Catilinarian conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Catilinarian_conspiracy) but otherwise found him unpalatable -- it's not clear how vigorous the defence really was. The text does not survive and may never have been circulated - perhaps Cicero was only going through the motions on that one.
