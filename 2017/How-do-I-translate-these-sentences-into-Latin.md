___programma errata, quin non homo?___ ____ — “programs are wrong, so why not Man?” “Programma” is how they do it in the Vatican nowadays.

___morsi declamandi sunt___ _,_ “irritants (literally, ‘bites’) should be proclaimed publicly”

The first one’s harder, because of the cultural reference and the rhyme. My best shot is

___humores sui non rumores,___ where _humores_  is “moods” or “feelings” and _rumores_  is “the mutterings of the crowd”. To get the ‘don’t let’ in there, you might try ___humores sui non sint rumores___ _or “may your feelings not be the the mumblings of the crowd”_
