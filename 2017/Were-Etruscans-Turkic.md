Not exactly. There’s very [good reason to connect the Etruscans to Asia Minor ](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2007/06/lydians-etruscans/#.WeJGTxNSyg8)— but it’s the Asia Minor of the Bronze Age, two thousand years before ethnic Turks showed up. The genetic evidence is still hotly debated, but it at least can be made to fit in with the idea of a proto-Etruscan migration from Asia Minor.

If the Anatolian connection is true, the Etruscans were descendants the people we know from later history as Lydians or Phrygians (the [literary evidence](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=1:chapter=94), as opposed to gene studies, would place this migration some time between 1200 and 800 BC).

So, it's possible the Etruscans were “Turkish” — ie, with roots in modern Turkey — but not “Turkic” in the sense of belonging to a Turkic-language or Turkish ethnic group.
