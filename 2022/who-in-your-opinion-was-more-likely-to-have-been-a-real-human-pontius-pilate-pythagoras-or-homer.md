Pilate is archaeologically attested in his own lifetime:



We’ve even found a single [copper ring with the inscription ΠΙΛΑΤΟ](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/world/middleeast/pontius-pilate-ring.html) — unlikely to be his personal property (if nothing else, he’d probably notice the typo!) but perhaps belonging to a member of his staff or a servant.

He’s mentioned by the Jewish writer Philo in his [address to Caligula](http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book40.html), a few years later, in the context of general unrest in Judaea. He’s also mentioned in Tacitus (though given an incorrect title, at least, different from what’s attested on the inscription).

There are two, very brief mentions of Pythagoras close to his own lifetime: [a snippet from Xenophanes of Colophon](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Fragments_of_Xenophanes) and [another from Heraclitus](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Fragments_of_Heraclitus) (though both of these are from later quotations: neither original survives). Pythagoras is also discussed by Plato, writing in the early 4th century BC — somewhat more than a century after Pythagoras’ death. We do have a very detailed biographical material for Pythagoras — however most it dates from 600–700 years after his day (the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on the sources for Pythagoras ](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoras/#:~:text=The%20most%20important%20of%20these,of%20the%20fourth%20century%20BCE.)has a good, comprehensible roundup). Although Pythagoras accumulated a lot of somewhat dubious anecdotes over time, the early mentions make it quite likely that he was historic — if perhaps less interesting than his much later biographers make him out to be.

Homer has no contemporary mentions; they would be pretty surprising, since the traditional date for his lifetime is really before the dawn of Greek alphabetic writing. His name was very well known by historic times and there were a variety of oral traditions around him, but effectively there is no chance that his historicity could be verified. His existence or non-existence has been debated for centuries. [I tend to think he was historic, but for reasons that are frankly subjective.](https://www.quora.com/What-Who-inspired-Homerus-in-the-main/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=16289005&share=29bd7d4b&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer)
