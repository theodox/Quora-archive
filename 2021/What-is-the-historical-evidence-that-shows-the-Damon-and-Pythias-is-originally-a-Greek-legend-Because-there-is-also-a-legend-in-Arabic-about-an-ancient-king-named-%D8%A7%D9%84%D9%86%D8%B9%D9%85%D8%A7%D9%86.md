# What is the historical evidence that shows the Damon and Pythias is originally a Greek legend? Because there is also a legend in Arabic about an ancient king (named النعمان بن المنذر) and two persons, that resembles the one of Damon and Pythias.

The original version is believed to go back to [Aristoxenus of Tarentum](https://oxfordre.com/classics/classics/abstract/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-773?rskey=Ese8cP&result=39), a student of Aristotle’s who lived between about 375 and 300 BCE.

We don’t have Aristoxenus’ original version: the most common modern telling comes from a quotation of Aristoxenus by the philosopher Iamblichus (242–325 CE). There’s a [link here](https://archive.org/details/devitapythagoric00iamb/page/162/mode/2up?view=theater) — unfortunately only in Greek). However we can be sure the story was circulating a good bit earlier: it’s mentioned by two contemporaries of Julius Caesar, Diodorus Siculus (his version [here](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/10*.html), in English) and Cicero (in [De Officiis 38.10](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Officiis/3B*.html#Damon_and_Phintias) and [Tusculan Disputations, 5.22](http://www.attalus.org/old/tusc5A.html)— English again) in the first century BCE though they both use the alternate spelling “Phinteas” instead of “Pytheas.”

At the same period there was also a version of the same story under the names of Moeros and Seluntius in the _Fabulae_ of Hyginus ([257, English here](https://topostext.org/work/206)) .

So, we’re quite sure the story was popular as early as the first century BCE. There no strong reason to dispute the belief that it goes back a couple of hundred years earlier: Dionysius of Sicily was a historical figure and the complex relationship between Pythagorean philosophers and the Syracusan court is well known from the period. Aristoxenus was a popular author (though only two of his 453 (!) books survive today and a well known figure in Athenian circles.

On the other hand it’s not as clear that the story is really _true_ : the treacherous Sicilian court was notorious in antiquity and made a tempting place to set a moralizing tale, particularly one contrasting a philosophically-minded hero and a tyrant. This was the setting for the (probably unhistorical) “[sword of Damocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles)” story, the historic but murky [enslavement of Plato](https://aeon.co/essays/when-philosopher-met-king-on-platos-italian-voyages), and the tragic careers of the would-be liberators [Dion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_of_Syracuse#:~:text=Dion%20(%2F%CB%88da%C9%AA%C9%92,most%20trusted%20minister%20and%20adviser.&text=An%20indiscreet%20letter%20from%20Dion%20to%20the%20Carthaginians%20led%20to%20his%20banishment.) and [Timoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timoleon). It was the perfect time and place to set a morality story, so even if the story goes back to Aristoxenus it’s hard to know how literally to take it.

If the Arabic story is attached to one of the [Lakhmid kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakhmids#Lakhmid_rulers), it’s definitely much later — 3–500 years later than the popular versions and 5–700 years later than the date of the original story.
