Let's put a big bracket around Alexander III of Macedon, aka "Alexander the Great". Ancient opinion was pretty much universal that he was an exceptional leader, both on and off the battlefield. He wasn't omniscient and he seems to have been prone to either alcoholism or intermittent bouts of mania, or possibly both: but he was -- as results show -- an impossibly successful conqueror. Any definition of leadership where his career is not regarded as extraordinary is too tweaked to be generally useful. He was the most successful leader of his age, by far.

With that large exception out of the way, though, I'm not so sure that the Greeks really had superior leadership. Persians -- even in Greek sources -- were usually reputed to be honest, loyal and fair; Greek politicians were notoriously treacherous: not only to their enemies, whom they were happy to deceive, but also to their "friends" and certainly to their fellow Greeks. A few notable examples:

__[Themistocles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themistocles#Fall_and_exile)__  was incredibly daring and clever. He definitely deserves credit for the victory at Salamis which saved the Greeks from the superior Persian fleet. But we was a bit of slippery character — he was implicated in the plot of __[Pausanias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pausanias_(general))__  , who despite defeating the Persians at Plataea was widely believed to be planning to sell out the Greek cause and get himself made first man in Greece with Persian backing. Themistocles might not have been working with Pausanias -- but he was worried enough about the political optics to flee to the Persian court. The savior of Athens ended up as a powerful political adviser to king Artaxerxes (Plutarch's[ Life of Themistocles](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Themistocles*.html) tells the story well with typical dramatic flair).

Themistocles’ reputation for slipperiness is well deserved. For example, he warned the Persians about a Greek plan to break Xerxes' bridge over the Hellespont, which would have trapping the Persian army. It has been debated since antiquity if this was a form of treacherous insurance for his own fortunes, or a wise move preventing another bloody, all-out battle after Plataea. He also leaked news of the Greek navy's movements to the Persians in order (so he said) to bring on the battle in favorable waters at Salamis. Even if both cases were really clever statesmanship, the fact that both also provided Themistocles with a personal escape hatch is very typical of the man.

And Themistocles was one of the _good_  Greeks. He actually fought, and he willingly subordinated himself and Athens to the good of the Greek cause -- unlike rivals who hemmed and hawed, argued over precedence, or threatened to desert the cause when things looked bad or when they were spited (one of the reason Themistocles told the Persians where the Greek fleet was at Salamis was to prevent the timid Spartan admiral Eurybiades from withdrawing to a safer, but less strategic spot). Many Greek cities surrendered without a fight, and a few volunteered to fight for the Persians in order to settle grievances against their Greek neighbors (the Thebans, for example).

After war against Xerxes, the short-lived alliance among the Greeks collapsed quickly. The aforementioned Pausanias, who led the coalition’s land forces, was cashiered for mistreating the allies and plotting to make himself some kind of king. The Spartans lost interest in the great crusades. The Athenians took over the alliace — but they soon converted the [Delian League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_League) into a protection racket, and then into an empire. Both Athens and Sparta (and other self-seeking Greek cities) played footsie with various Persian kings or satraps when it suited their interests from the end of the war with Xerxes (480 BC) all the way down to the point where Macedon became the dominant power. Throughout this period the Greeks loved vague rhetoric about Greek freedom and unity, but they never actually pursued a united front, preferring to fight each other ferociously (most notably in the [Peloponnesian War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War)).

Along the way Greece produced a few more notable adventurers, notably [Alcibiades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades), [Lysander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander) and [Agesilaus II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agesilaus_II) — all of whom displayed great military talent married to political double-dealings and willingness to sell out their friends when it became advantageous. And, of course, that pattern reasserted itself with Alexander's death: Alexander's massive empire was torn apart in factional fights within two years of his death, and the Greek world spent the next 40 years in an endless series of pile-on-the-leader fratricidal wars.

By contrast, the Persian empire of [Cyrus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Greatoutlived) lasted more than 220 years. The Persians, too, had their own civil wars and misadventures (the worst being the revolt of [Cyrus the Younger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Younger)). The first Cyrus in was universally respected outside of Persia (he features in the Bible as _the Anointed of the Lord,_ and in an idealizing biography by the Athenian general Xenophon. In general, the Persians were easy masters who left their subjects alone, an amiable trait in imperialists. The only part of the Persian empire which really hated its masters was the Egypt, which revolted repeatedly.

The story of that revolt lays bare one the more pressing realities of why the Greek/Macedonians defeated the Persians. During the revolt of Cyrus the younger a Greek mercenary army (including Xenophon, the biographer-general) marched clear across the heartland of the empire from Sardis to Cunaxa (deep in Mesopotamia) and thence to the Black Sea:

This illustrates better than any thing else that the Persians never figured out how to defeat Greek heavy infantry: their heterogenous, mobile, cavalry-oriented army could not break a disciplined Greek hoplite army or a Macedonian phalanx. With the addition of Alexander's leadership and Macedonian cavalry to even the scales on the maneuvering front, the Persians were simply outclassed on the battlefield.

It wasn't until the Romans came along -- with more flexible infantry tactics and a much more resilient, stable political system -- that the Greek hegemony would be overthrown. If the Greeks really had had good leadership, it might still have gone the other way.

__Update:__ as [Mohammad Amin Khanpour](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mohammad-Amin-Khanpour) points out in the comments, the Persian leadership of Alexander's era was much shakier than in the 5th century
