You can’t read anything “by Socrates”— everything we know about Socrates is second hand.

We don’t have books by Socrates because he did not believe that philosophy could be transmitted in writing — at least, that’s what his student Plato, who is our major source for Socrates says.

There have been centuries of debate about how much of Plato’s portrait of Socrates is observation and how much is Plato putting words into Socrates’s mouth. Plato’s own thinking evolved over time, and so his Socrates seems a bit schizophrenic if you consider all of the things Plato has him say: in many dialogues he is a skeptical and cautious thinker who emphasizes the limits o human understanding — but in others (especially the Republic) he talks like a confident, programmatic thinker with ambitious positives plans to remake society. [Plato’s works are widely available](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/93) online. The most famous (the Republic) is unfortunately one where the character of Socrates is generally assumed to be a mouthpiece for Plato.

The other major contemporary source is [Xenophon](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0212), who was also a student of Socrates. His picture is a useful corrective for the idea that Plato’s view of Socrates is the plain truth, though it agrees with the general picture of a probing, skeptical but charismatic gadfly.

There are a couple of other contemporary references to Socrates, the most famous being a very silly caricature from the comic poet [Aristophanes](https://blog.oup.com/2015/12/birth-comedy-socrates-aristophanes/), who treats Socrates as a kind of Ancient Greek mad scientist.

There’s a great roundup of what these sources do and don’t teach us about Socrates the individual here: [Socrates : Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/#ThrPriSouAriXenPla)
