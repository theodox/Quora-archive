The scholarly convention is that he’s Gilgameš in Akkadian, and Bilgameš in Sumerian — though it’s really more complicated than that.*

You can write it a few ways in cuneiform (this is not an exhaustive list).

𒄑 𒉋 𒉽 𒂵 𒈩 GIŠ-bil2-pap-ga-meš

𒄑𒉋𒂵𒈩 GIŠ-bil2-ga-meš

𒄑𒂅𒈦 GIŠ-gin2-ma-maš

𒄑𒉈𒂵𒈩 GIŠ-ne-ga-meš

𒄑 𒉈 𒁺 𒈩 GIŠ-bil-mes-meš

Part of the confusion is just that cuneiform is not very consistent. There there are unspoken elements. There are signs with multiple contradictory pronunciations; for example the symbol 𒈦 here read as maš but in other contexts is read as the sounds “bar” or “par”. There are competing symbols for the same sound (such as 𒉋 and 𒉈 for “bil”) — that’s why you often see numbers in the transcription, they call out different glyphs of the same sound.

On top of all that, scribes could combine different “spellings” to achieve different effects or to impress other scribes or just because things had always been spelled a certain way. So the two-character sequences GIŠ-bil2, GIŠ-bil, and GIŠ-ne are all pronounced “bil” in Sumerian. Eventually, in Akkadian, this came to be pronounced “gil” — that’s how the name ended up as _Gilagamos_ ______ in [it’s one-and-only survival in Greek](http://www.argonauts-book.com/aelian-on-gilgamesh.html) and _Gilgamesh_  [in the Dead Sea Scrolls](http://www.oocities.org/tidbits4you/giants.html).

An interesting but probably unprovable theory is that the real original name was _Pabilgames_  or _Pabilgameš,_ which would mean “the ancestral hero” or something along those lines — that might explain the presence of the _pap_ glyph in the first spelling. There’s a related ordinary person’s name, _Pabilsag_ , “chief senior kinsman.”

If you really want to see what a puzzle cuneiform can be, you can dig a lot deeper here in chapter 2:
