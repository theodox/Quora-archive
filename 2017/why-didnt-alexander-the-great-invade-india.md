_This was originally written in answer to “_ ___Did Alexander the Great Conquer India”___ _— after a series of question merges I’ve reworked to match the current wording._ 

To some degree it depends on your definition of “India”.

Alexander ended up in nominal control of the Indus Valley. Some areas of modern Pakistan and Afghanistan which had been part of the Persian empire, switched allegiance to Alexander peacefully. In other areas — frequently in the mountains, where Persian control had been mostly nominal — he had to fight.

We don’t have great information on the precise nature of the Indian-Persian relationship before Alexander but we do know that the Persians regarded the Indus basin as tributary; the city of [Taxila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxila) seems have been the Persian headquarters in the region but it (like many parts of the Persian empire) it was administered primarily by locals. The Persians established themselves in the area around 515 BC.

Alexander tried to push the old Persian border east once he crossed the Hindu-Kush into the (geographical) Punjab, fighting and defeating king [Porus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porus) on the river Jhelum. However his troops — now 3,000 miles from home — soon mutinied at the thought of further conquests; they were also very worried by reports of the power of the [Nanda Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanda_Empire):

> Gangaridai, a nation which possesses a vast force of the largest-sized elephants. Owing to this, their country has never been conquered by any foreign king: for all other nations dread the overwhelming number and strength of these animals. Thus Alexander the Macedonian, after conquering all Asia, did not make war upon the Gangaridai, as he did on all others; for when he had arrived with all his troops at the river Ganges, he abandoned as hopeless an invasion of the Gangaridai when he learned that they possessed four thousand elephants well trained and equipped for war.

Most sources say he stopped even earlier, on the Beas river which is not far over the modern Pakistani-Indian border.

Evidently the Persians didn’t control the mouth of the river — its notable that the accounts of Alexander’s conquest change gears during the southward march to the sea. The most brutal of Alexander’s conquests in the east is the campaign against the [Mallians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallian_campaign) barred the way south. Some historians think that the recorded name of the Mallian capital, “Multan”, derives from the Persian word for “border” or “frontier” which might suggest that Persian influence ended near there.

About 150 years later, the Greek rulers of Bactria conquered parts of the same area and much of the Indus valley, which they ruled as the [Indo-Greek Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek_Kingdom) until around the beginning of our era. One of the Greco-Bactrian kings, [Menander I,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menander_I) is remembered in Buddhist literature as a pious convert to Buddhism.
