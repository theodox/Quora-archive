There are a lot of different cases, but the main enemy of records isn’t people: it’s time.

Fundamentally all written media have a half life: for cheap paper it could be 10 years and for well preserved, acid free paper it might be 400. Add in the accidents of fire, flood, worms and simple neglect and the loss rate is truly astronomical: way more than 9 of 10 books we know about from classical antiquity exist only in fragments or name-drops and most of the biggest, best preserved texts have missing segments. Until the invention of print only constant, laborious, expensive re-copying of existing manuscripts could preserve them. You don’t need a disaster or an invasion to wipe out a corpus of texts : you just need time and inattention. Annihilation is the default fate of information over time.

With that said, there are some commonalities to the things that do preserve texts.

First, the mechanics:

The “best case” scenario — for a given value of “best case,” of course, is if you write your official documents on clay tablets. When marauding barbarians burn your capital to the ground, the tablets are fired like pots in a kiln, preserving them for posterity even though, alas for you, you probably won’t be around to enjoy them. This is how we have such treasure troves of primary source material as the [Linear B archives of Knossos,](http://sirarthurevans.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/collection/linearb/images.php) the [Ebla tablets](http://www.ebla.it/escavi__gli_archivi_di_stato.html), and [The Great Libray of Ashurbanipal.](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/asbp/)

On a related note, you can always do your recording on s0mething really durable. You might do it to make a statement, or to make things open to public inspection, or simply because you didn’t want to worry about preservation. Some prime examples of carved-in-stone records include the [Athenian tribute lists,](http://classics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-6556?rskey=NBUKdf&result=135) the [Res Gestae of Augustus,](http://classics.mit.edu/Augustus/deeds.html) the [Behistun Inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_Inscription), the [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone), and innumerable bombastic records from Egypt and Mesopotamia. The line between ‘official archives’ and ‘propaganda’ is often a bit thin when this kind of show public presentation is used for recording.

Metal was also a popular recording mechanism — it’s durable and easier to work than stone. But it’s not actually a good choice: it’s too easy and tempting to recycle. The [Egyptian–Hittite peace treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%E2%80%93Hittite_peace_treaty), for example, was originally recorded on a silver tablet but exists today only in baked-clay copies. The [early treaties between Rome and Carthage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaties_between_Rome_and_Carthage#First_treaty_509_BC) were inscribed on bronze tablet which Polybius claimed to have inspected, 350 years later, but have long since disappeared; but the [Pyrgi Gold Tablets](https://www.academia.edu/1416974/Work_notes_on_the_Pyrgi_Gold_Tablets) give a good example of what they must have been like. A particularly distressing loss is the set of bronze tablets on which [Hanno the Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanno_the_Navigator) recorded his adventures in 6th century BC West Africa, which disappeared after the destruction of Carthage.

Another good case is desertification. If you live in a sufficiently arid climate, otherwise perishable materials don’t just rot away. The ordinary half-life of papyrus was something like a hundred years, but in a place like the Egyptian desert that century could stretch out to several, or even past the millenium mark. Desertification gives us occasional gems like [a 4500 year old Egyptian spreadsheet](https://theodox.quora.com/The-worlds-oldest-spreadsheet), the [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls), and above all the [Oxyrhnchus papyri](http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/VExhibition/exhib_welcome.html): a vast Romano-Egyptian landfill which gave us priceless (and utterly unique) insights into life in Roman Egypt that we get from no other source — not just literary manuscripts but things like tax rolls, court records, private letters, even playbills and advertising: the kinds of things nobody would bother to preserve, but historians crave.

In the end, though, nothing matters like __interest__ . Texts people want get copied and recopied; those they have no concern for die of their own accord or survive only — like those papyri mummified in the Egyptian desert — by happy accidents. Before print very few societies had the leisure to preserve things just for the curiosity of future scholars. Manuscript preservation is expensive and time consuming: most ancient governments were more interested in piling up paperwork for their own affairs than ensuring a legacy for the future. Before the age of print the historian operated primarily in the interval between utility and oblivion.

Thus, it’s texts with__practical utility__  which survive: that’s why we have lots of Greek astronomy and mathematics or Roman books on running and army or a legal system. And it’s worth noting that significant chunks of ‘Greek’ science are recycled Babylonian or Egyptian science: if its useful it doesn’t go out of circulation. The same principle governs archival material: tax records like the [Domesday Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book) or the Florentine [Catasto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catasto) survive because subsequent governments need them to collect money (and, regardless of the shape of government they all want to know who owes them: both of those examples survived many changes of regime before entering the realm of historical curiosity). Treaties survive as long as they might matter — does that boundary really sit on this river? Didn’t you promise you’d ask permission before enlarging your fleet? and Hey, wait, my claim that newly vacant throne is better than this joker’s!

This source bias is one reason early modern history was so overburdened with dry details of forgettable wars, dynastic dalliances, and esoteric ecclesiastical conferences: those things were all sitting in archives waiting to be read.

_The Domesday book has been cited in property disputes since 1085 — it was last referenced in court in the 1960’s_ 

The other way texts become immortal, of course, is ideological importance: if a text becomes something like a relic it will be preserved. This is obviously true for religious texts — most of what he know about the ins and outs of late Roman courts comes not from state archives but from the [Acta Sanctorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acta_Sanctorum) — the Catholic register of saints, which records the fate of 3rd and 4th century martyrs using dry paraphrases of court proceedings as well as flowery accounts of miracles and conversions.

But the halo effect is also true for texts that matter to the legitimacy of secular institutions: the Magna Carta or the original of the US Constitution are preserved because they are talismans of power. The piece of parchment which shows that the Pope exempted you from taxes, or the Emperor gave you the right to buy silk directly from Sicily is going to last as long as those rights have value — and high-value originals like that will often survive a regime change as trophies, not unlike the enemy battle flags which decorate a regimental mess.

And of course there are just happy accidents — the priceless bit of history left in the bottom of a chest for 200 years, the manuscripts sealed intact in a collapsed cellar, or the pretty picture that caught the eye of succession of bored scribes in medieval monasteries who wanted a change from copying out theological tracts.

_These Roman legion shield designs date to the late 4th or early 5th century; they’re part of the_ _[Notitia Dignitatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notitia_Dignitatum)_ _, a Roman manual describing the military and political divisions of the empire. Renaissance scholars found it worth preserving — it’s less clear how or why it survived the thousand years between its creation and this 15th century copy_
