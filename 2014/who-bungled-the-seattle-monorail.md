A lot of big landowners downtown didn't like it because elevated trains are usually a drag on real estate prices. They fought it with lobbying, lawsuits, and the dreaded "Seattle Process" which makes it notoriously difficult to get permits for anything.

Though it was voted in by the citizens, the monorail was never a popular darling. Much of the city really didn't care about it because it would not have benefited the semi-suburban parts of the periphery where most people actually live (there are way more people downtown today than there were back then). Once the bills started rolling in -- and the real costs started to appear -- a lot of support evaporated. Ironically the only reason it was merely an embarassment, and not a debacle, is that the land that was purchased for stations and rights of way went up so much in value (this was real-estate boom time) that the real estate gains covered much of the financial losses.

The real reason is: we're Seattle. We are _terrible_ at infrastructure. 

We rammed I-5 right through the middle of downtown. We sank the floating bridge. We built that damn ugly viaduct and then let it limp along for a generation past it's design date. It took 13 years to run a light rail line from downtown to the airport that takes twice as long as driving. We've spent a lifetime trying to fix Mercer street and its still a nightmare. We killed a nice little neighborhood by "forgetting" to repair the South Park Bridge. 

Let's not even talk about the Tunnel.

*sigh*
