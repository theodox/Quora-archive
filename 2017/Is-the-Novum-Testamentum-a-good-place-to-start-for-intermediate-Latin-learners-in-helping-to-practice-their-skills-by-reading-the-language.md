It’s good in some ways, because it’s got a lot of familiar subject matter which makes it less of a minefield. It’s going to be a better guide to post-classical Latin than to the language of Cicero and Virgil, since so much later Latin is steeped in the style of the New Testament. The diction tends to be simpler and you won’t run into a lot of those “100 words between subject and verb” monsters that you get in the capital-C classics, which makes it relatively easy to follow. The vocabulary is less difficult than some of the showier Roman authors — the main issue will be lots of unfamiliar proper names (often, indeclinable ones) but those are not too big a problem.

One thing to be careful about is that very familiar subject matter can be a bit too easy to gloss over. This is equally true for the gospels and for Latinized versions of things like [Hobbitus Ille](http://amzn.to/2xmWOEo) — its easy to fool yourself into thinking you’ve seen the structure of what you’re reading when you’re really just remembering the English you already know.

The whole New Testament is available online [here](http://www.vatican.va/archive/bible/nova_vulgata/documents/nova-vulgata_novum-testamentum_lt.html).
