It’s got a neat multi-layer etymology.

_Bible_  comes from the Latin _biblia sacra,_ which is literally “sacred books”, in the plural. Our modern usage is mostly a post-Reformation thing in which the idea of one Holy Book replaces the older idea of holy _books._ That shift reflects the idea that everything from the cosmology of Genesis to the ritual details of Leviticus to the love-poetry of the Song of Solomon and the bleak philosophical skepticism of Job are all part of one book, intended to be read as a whole — an idea that took many centuries to emerge.

_Biblia_  itself comes originally from the Greek βιβλίον, which also means “book” — but the word is almost an ancient brand name. It comes from the Phoenician city of [Byblos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byblos), which played a unique as an intermediary between Egypt and the rest of the ancient world. Egyptian papyrus was the primary writing medium of the Greek world, but the Greeks got their papyrus from the Phoenician traders of Byblos. The name stuck in the way same way that _Scotch_  stuck to whiskey from Scotland or _Turquoise_  to blue stones from Turkmenistan.
