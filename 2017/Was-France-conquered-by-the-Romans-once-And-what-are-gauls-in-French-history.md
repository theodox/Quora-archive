France, [aka Gallia, aka Gaul](http://www.ancient.eu/gaul/), was indeed a key part of the Roman Empire.

That’s why the French comic icon [Asterix ](http://www.asterix.com/)is always fighting Romans.

As far as the Roman were concerned, “Gallia” — the land of the Gauls — was a good bit bigger than modern France . I t included much of northern Italy. but there were related peoples in central Europe, Spain, and the British Isles. Gauls and “Celts” — the terms aren’t native, and they are not used with much precision today — were a big but loose group of peoples who formed the largest cultural grouping in Europe (more [here](https://www.quora.com/What-were-other-old-world-countries-Russia-England-Ireland-etc-Like-during-the-time-of-Alexander-the-great)).

Gallic cultures were very widely spread in this period, all the way from from Britain to Turkey, but they [never united into a large political unit](https://www.quora.com/Wy-didnt-an-empire-rise-in-non-Roman-Europe). Even so, the Romans generally had a serious fear of Gauls. In 390 or 387BC the Italian Gauls actually conquered Rome - the only time that would happen for the next 800 years.

So, the big thing about the Gauls from the Roman perspective is that they were scary. And _close:_ the reason Julius Caesar’s revolt against the Senate started when he “crossed the Rubicon” is that the legal border of [Italian Gaul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisalpine_Gaul) was that Rubicon river, near modern Florence.

The Romans conquered the Italian portion of Gaul for good around 222 BC as part of the long series of wars which eventually unified Italy under Roman rule, but the larger French portion was mostly left alone. For the next hundred and fifty years or so “France” picked up more and more contact with the Mediterranean world, largely from Greeks (modern Marseilles was a Greek colony) but also from serving on both sides as mercenaries in the wars between Rome and Carthage. Gallic tribes started turning into something like city-states.

They also fought each other, and their neighbors to the east in what’s now Germany and Switzerland, with increasing regularity. The frontiers of the region were very fluid — many Gauls and most Germans were pastoralists rather than settled farmers so they moved a lot, in search of better pastures or because of population pressure. This climaxed in the [Cimbrian Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimbrian_War) between 113 and 101 BC which a huge migration of Germanic peoples westward into Gaul set off a panic in Italy and southern Gaul. First defeating the Germanic invaders and then dealing with the political ramifications drew the Romans increasingly into Gallic affairs.

Finally, Julius Caesar arrived on the scene in the year 58 BC. In addition to Rome’s traditional worries about the Gauls and the security problems caused by the unsettled politics of the region, Caesar was an extremely talented general who happened also to be incredibly ambitious and flat-out broke. He [stretched his official duties as governor of Italian Gaul into what eventually became a decade-long conquest of pretty much all of modern France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars). Caesar’s military talents and the fact that the Gauls were all fighting each other as well as the Romans enabled him to conquer the region despite limited support from the Roman government.

From Caesars time until the collapse of the western Roman empire in 476, Gaul was a key part of the Roman empire. The Gauls adopted Roman ways and language (that’s why modern French is a “Romance” language — it’s derived from Latin). The Romans were good at assimilation — within a century of Caesar’s time there were [Gauls in the Roman Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon_Tablet), and Gallic units served in Roman armies all over the Mediterranean world. In the 3rd Century the Roman empire briefly fell apart and a short lived “[Gallic Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Empire)” operated as in independent state from 260 to 284, but it was peacefully re-absorbed into the Roman empire. In the 300’s and 400’s, many emperors used modern Arles (Roman [Arelate](http://www.livius.org/articles/place/arelate-arles/)) and Trier (French Treves, Roman [Augusta-Treverorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Trier)) as capital cities.
