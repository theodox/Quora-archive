# Why do Middle Persian sources like Arda-Viraf Namag and Karnamag-i Ardashir-i Papagan, never consider Alexander the Great as a Greek?

Authentic Persian-language sources are, unfortunately, quite distant in time from the events of the Achaemenid era. If there ever was an authentic Achaemenid historiographical tradition, it lapsed during the Seleucid and Parthian periods. By the time you get to the Sassanians in the third century of our era (and thus more than five hundred years after Alexander’s career) the written sources reflect a mishmash of folk tales, oral traditions, and (ironically) Greek literature. [There are a few glimpses, here and there, of Achaemenid-era realities — but for the most part the middle Persian view of the Achaemenid era is a tremendous muddle](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Sasanians-know-about-the-Achaemenid-empire-If-so-what-was-their-view-on-it).

Generally, sources which come from the Zoroastrian religious tradition are pretty hostile to Alexander. _Arda-Viraf_ describes him as a literal agent evil:

> the accursed Evil Spirit, the Wicked One… instigated the accursed Alexander, the westerner who was dwelling in Egypt, so that he came to the country of Iran with severe cruelty and war and devastation; he also slew the ruler of Iran, and destroyed the metropolis and empire, and made them desolate.

You’ll note that he’s rather vaguely described as a “westerner dwelling in Egypt” — this might just be hand waving, or it might reflect the _other_ strand in Persian retellings of the story.

That alternative tradition relies ultimately on the [Alexander Romance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Romance), an entertaining but very unreliable Greek text which was popular all over the Near East in a variety of languages. The Persian version is the [Eskandar-nama](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama) and it has Alexander as a half-Persian, the son of a Persian king “Darab” (presumably, Darius II) and a daughter of “Failakus”, emperor of Rum. By the time you get to a second version in the [twelfth century](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama-of-nezami), Alexander has conquered China, made a pilgrimage to Mecca, and defeated the vikings before becoming a prophet who sets out to convert the world to monotheism.

Alexander had a long afterlife in Persia but whatever else it was about, strict historical accuracy was not part of the package.
