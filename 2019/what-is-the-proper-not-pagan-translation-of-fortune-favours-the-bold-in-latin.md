There are quite a few versions of this floating around; it’s an eminently Roman sentiment and they expressed it more than a few proverbial ways.

The most famous is _audentis Fortuna iuvat,_ which shows up in the Aeneid, however alternative renderings include _fortis Fortuna adiuvat_ from the Roman poet Terence and _fortes Fortuna iuvat,_ which the Roman admiral Pliny quoted before sailing his fleet boldly — but unluckily — to rescue refugees from destruction of Pompeii.

Strictly speaking the closet rendering is ___fortuna favet audaci___ _,_ since “favet” is literally “favors” (_iuvat_  and _adiuvat_  are more like “helps”) and _audax_ — the root of our “audacious” — indicates boldneess. _Fortis_  has a secondary meaning of ‘brave’ but it’s primary connotation is strength rather than daring.

In any, there’s not really a good way to offer a ‘non pagan’ version, since Roman paganism tended to personify abstract nouns: the difference between _fortuna_  the translation of “luck” and _Fortuna_ the goddess of luck was never very clear in Roman usage. Lacking lower-case letters, they never had an easy way of distinguishing the two.
