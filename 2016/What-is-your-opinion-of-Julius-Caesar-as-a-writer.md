He's very good. In fact I'd qualify a lot of his writing as _scarily good,_ because it conveys the illusion of sincerity and directness very effectively -- even when Caesar is not being very sincere or direct.

Caesar's style is quite distinctive for his time and place; it's lean and muscular and makes a very definite contrast to the flowery fashion of his time. Cicero, who was the epitome of late-Republican Latin eloquence, is very windy and dramatic -- the bane of generations of schoolchildren who had to work their way through his long, convoluted sentences.* Caesar reads much more cleanly and doesn' t tax the listener with verbal gymnastics. Here's what Cicero had to say about Caesar's writings:

> [They] merit the highest approbation: for they are plain, correct, and graceful, and divested of all the ornaments of language, so as to appear (if I may be allowed the expression) in a kind of undress.... he has certainly prevented all sensible men from attempting any improvement on his plan.

Given how strongly Cicero's tastes ran in the opposite direction, that's very high praise. It's even more noteworthy when you realize the piece from which it's lifted is dedicated to [Brutus ](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcus-Junius-Brutus): the Brutus of _Et tu, Brute_ .

The reason I say 'scary' is that Caesar's simplicity can be very deceptive. In this regard he reminds me of Winston Churchill: they are both extremely capable writers, but both of them are apparently _incapable_ of saying anything entirely spontaneous. They are always on stage, always aware of the politics of what they write and say. Both men expend a great deal of effort to frame their narratives to put themselves and their labors in the most positive light. It's all the more dangerous because (unlike the wooden prose of your average political ghost-writer) their writing is so fluent and gives such a convincing illusion of first-hand witness. The "Caesar" of Alesia and the "Churchill" of the attack on the Dardanelles are carefully crafted literary characters designed to convince as well as to inform, posing the hero as a serious, but concerned man of action on a well-placed dramatic stage. Despite the illusion of intimacy this is not 'an eyewitness to history': you have to read Caesar with the same degree of skepticism you'd apply to Churchill's description of the Gallipoli campaign, and for the same reason: there is never an unguarded line in either book.

Cicero alluded to this guardedly in where I put the ellipses above:

> But while he pretended only to furnish the loose materials, for such as might be inclined to compose a regular history, he may, perhaps, have gratified the vanity of a few literary embroiderers

In the same way that people reading Hemingway sometime forget how much work went into his 'plain,' 'unvarnished' words of his it's always important to remember that Caesar is the opposite of artless. This is especially true of the _Gallic Wars_ , which were designed to be sent back from the field and circulated in Rome while Caesar was away on campaign. The _Civil Wars_  are less seamlessly tweaked in large part because they were composed in more complex and stressful circumstances -- and because Caesar's lieutenant [Aulus Hirtius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Hirtius) was responsible for much of the writing.



*Caesar is not above the occasional showy bit either. There's a [famously obtuse passage in the Gallic Wars](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Romans-of-antiquity-speak-with-adjectives/answer/Steve-Theodore) which is a single sentence of 139 words -- either a big lapse in stylistic judgement or a bored Caesar playing word games in his tent one night.
