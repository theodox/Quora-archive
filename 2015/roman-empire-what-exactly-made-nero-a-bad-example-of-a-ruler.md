The short version is, he was either an incredibly spoiled brat or borderline insane. As [Assaph Mehr](https://www.quora.com/profile/Assaph-Mehr) correctly notes the ancient sources definitely reflect the hostility of the next dynasty -- but even if you assume exaggerations, the picture is still pretty disturbing.

Here's a somewhat longer version:

Nero's rule actually started off reasonably well. His predecessor, [Claudius](http://www.ancient.eu/claudius/), became increasingly paranoid as his rule wore on, and the on-and-off spates of treason trials and secret denunciations left upper-class Rome on edge. Nero came on the scene as a well educated golden boy, surrounded by high expectations. His mother -- the notoriously ambitious and clever [Agrippina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippina_the_Younger) -- has campaigned for years to get him on the throne, despite the fact that he was not Claudius' son (to be fair, Roman succession [was not automatically hereditary](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires) ). Among her other maneuvers she hired the noted Stoic philosopher [Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger) as the boy's tutor to burnish up Nero's image, and played up the image of a young philosopher-prince who would restore the peaceful days of Augustus.

Claudius died in 54 AD (with help, allegedly, from Agrippina and a [dish of poisoned mushrooms](http://ancientstandard.com/2011/06/16/locusta-romes-professional-poisoner/)). Nero -- now 17 or so --- was ushered onto the scene amid much fanfare and general relief. He canceled some unpopular taxes, threw big public feasts, assiduously courted the Senate, and above all he proclaimed an end to the show trials and midnight disappearances which marked the last, bitter years of Claudius' reign. For a few months everything looked good.

_Nero and Britannicus in happier times_ 

There was, however, a lot going on behind the surface of this brief idyll.

Agrippina fully intended to rule through her son but Nero had other ideas. The angry mother threatened to depose her son and replace him with his half-brother, Claudius' son [Britannicus](http://Britannicus). Nero responded by first marginalizing, then demeaning the boy. A few months after Nero's peacable debut Britannicus died abruptly of what Nero claimed was a seizure, but what most contemporaries believed was poison. Some sources also allege that the emperor raped the boy shortly before his death; this seems unlikely but the fact that the story circulated gives a good idea of just how unpopular Nero became later.

With Britannicus out of the picture, mother and son descended into a bizarre Oedipal power struggle. There were furious fights and tearful reconciliations. Agrippina's supporters and Nero's growing coterie of hangers-on waged covert bureaucratic warfare and battled for influence; it wasn't long before secret denunciations and treason trials made a sudden re-appearance. The more sensational accounts of Nero's relationship Agrippina claim that the relationship was actually incestuous -- but even the most sober ones depict an epically screwed up mother-son struggle - part power-politics, part teenage rebellion and maybe part _[Psycho](http://Psycho)_  .

Four years of psychodrama culminated in 59, when the exasperated Nero finally had his mother murdered. Afraid to be seen as a matricide, tried to do it with a jury-rigged collapsing yacht. However, she survived; when she swam to shore he had her killed in a more reliable way. Her last words were _"Here! Strike my womb!"_

_Nero and Agrippina in happier times. She was the first Roman woman to appear on a coin._ 

Like many other troubled youngsters, Nero (now 22) found that rebellion was a hard habit to drop even when the target of his confused emotions was gone. Instead of flouting his mother, he started flouting social conventions. He liked to sneak out of the palace at night in disguise and frequent brothels and low dives, but that was comparatively tame. His most famous bit of edginess was becoming a stage performer. While respectable people _attended_  theaters and concerts in Rome, they most definitely did _not_  perform: traditional Roman opinion viewed an emperor on stage about the way we would view a president shooting heroin in the bathroom of a biker bar. It didn't help that Nero packed the amphitheatres with armed supporters to make sure the crowds were appreciative: undignified is bad enough, but undignified and needy is a bad combination.

Oddly, one way he rebelled against the blue-bloods of Roman society was to rule as a populist. He courted popularity by lowering taxes on working people, limited lawyers fees (most lawyers, of course, were from the respectable classes) and protected freedmen from efforts by their former masters to re-enslave them. These measures were very popular with the lower classes but got mixed reviews from the elite -- which, of course, was the class to which our sources all belonged. This aspect of his legacy is probably the only one on which his contemporaries were divided.

Things really began to come apart with the [Great Fire](http://Great Fire) of 65. The fire itself was (probably) not Nero's fault -- all ancient cities were firetraps to begin with, and in the immediate aftermath Nero did most of the right things: organizing relief, drafting plans to rebuild the city, and even allowing the public to sleep in his palaces.

However by this point in his troubled reign -- and with the body count he had accumulated -- he was dogged by hostile rumors. The story about him singing and playing the lyre (this was several hundred years pre-fiddle) circulated widely, and whether it was accurate it was believed widely enough to show up in many quarters. As the relief efforts bogged down -- and as it became obvious that a giant, showy new palace was a key part of the new civic plan -- the mood in the city got ugly. It began to be suggested that Nero himself had the fire started to make room for his new palace and the 100 foot high statue of himself that was its centerpiece:

_What, me issues?_ 

The scapegoating of the Christians -- accomplished with typically graphic Roman brutality -- was intended to deflect attention and focus popular anger on a vulnerable minority, a pattern later emperors would return to repeatedly in the endemic crises of the 3d century. The city did not rise in rebellion, but the gory persecutions didn't revive Nero's flagging popularity.

In 65 -- with the city still digging out of the ashes -- Nero's agents unearthed a [conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisonian_conspiracy) including several influential Senators more importantly the some of the leadership of the Praetorian guard. Nero's retribution was predictably gruesome, and nearly 50 prominent Romans were executed or obliged to commit suicide. The victims included the handful of relatively respectable statesmen who had tried to moderate Nero's behavior including [Seneca](http://Seneca), his old tutor and the closet thing he had to a father figure. They also included close friend and poetic mentor, [Lucan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucan).

This direct threat seems to have knocked the props out of whatever sense Nero still had. Having killed his mother, his brother and his mentor, Nero next [killed his pregnant wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppaea_Sabina) -- although it seems to have been in a momentary rage rather than for reasons of state. The familiar machinery of Julio-Claudian terror swung into full gear against real or imagined threats to the emperor. For the next three years his reign slid rapidly into the same orgy of paranoia, denunciations and Cultural Revolution-style head games that Claudius and Caligula had made infamous.

Nero himself avoided most of the unpleasantness traveling to Greece. He collected many awards in thoroughly rigged Olympics.

Finally, in 67, a tax revolt in Gaul (fueled by the taxes imposed to pay for Nero's new palace) turned into a genuine mutiny. Nero returned to Italy but found nobody was particularly eager to defend him. He eventually killed himself in the mistaken belief that Senate had acclaimed the rebellious general [Galba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galba) in his stead.

Interestingly, he was mourned -- apparently sincerely -- by some. His vendettas against the Senate endeared him to the urban proletariat and to disaffected youths among the nobility. Two of the four short-lived rulers in the [Year of the Four Emperors](http://www.unrv.com/early-empire/year-four-emperors.php) which followed Nero's death, ruled openly as "Neronians" (see [How did Nero's poem "The Sack of Troy" go?](https://www.quora.com/How-did-Neros-poem-The-Sack-of-Troy-go)) He remained popular in the Greek east, which cared little for the lives of Roman aristocrats but appreciated his infatuation with Greek culture. Three different pretenders, claiming to be Nero, cropped up at different times under Vespasian, Hadrian and Domitian.

Nonethless: you wanted to know why Nero has a bad reputation. It's because _he worked hard to earn it_ .

666 is a wierd bit of code: Although Revelations was written in Greek, 666 is what you get by transliterating "Neron Kaisar" into Hebrew letters and taking their numerical value; a practice called [Gematria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria).
