From the first century onward, the Romans did have a very large and sophisticated set of fixed defenses for their permanent frontiers. These included a mix of forts, walls, ditches and natural obstacles like rivers. However they never took the form a single, continuous wall.

Partly this simply reflects basic Roman military doctrine. They didn't want a wall to keep invaders out: they wanted a belt of defenses to provide early warning and to slow their enemies down, allowing time for mobile field armies to concentrate and crush the invaders. The Romans in general didn't rely heavily on fixed fortifications: most Roman cities didn't get serious walls until the chaos of the third century.

_There were stone walls in important spots -- but a lot of their job was just to funnel traffic into cross-border customs stations_

_That's a pile of logs and tinder at left: a signal beacon. The most important job of the frontier forts was providing early warning for mobile forces behind the border._ 

The Romans also faced a different mix of enemies, which made the tactics rather different. 

 In Europe their primary foes were primarily infantry armies, moving at foot pace. The Chinese had to face off against horse-mounted nomads who could outpace the traditional Chinese foot formations easily; the Great Wall was an effort to canalize the movement of horse-borne enemies to allow the more sluggish defenders to bring them to battle. The Romans didn't have that problem to solve until rather late; while Rome had experience with horse-nomads and horse-archers like the [Sarmatians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarmatians), the western groups usually contented themselves with border raids until things really got tough in the 4th century. The steppe-dwellers also faced competition from the Germanic tribes in Central and Eastern Europe so they did not range as far as their eastern counterparts did along the Chinese border. 

The only serious invasion of western Europe by steppe-nomads was that of the [Huns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns), whose army also included many Germanic foot-sloggers. They were finally caught and turned back by the last functional Roman army of the west at [Battle of the Catalaunian Plains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Catalaunian_Plains) in 451, but only after cutting a big swathe through Gaul. 

 The devastation of that war was worse than the results of previous barbarian incursions; had the imperial government of the day been less dysfunctional they might have drawn the lesson that a more solid line of defenses was needed. Certainly the [Theodosian Walls of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walls_of_Constantinople) , built around the same time, suggest that the late Romans were learning to depend more on fortifications.
