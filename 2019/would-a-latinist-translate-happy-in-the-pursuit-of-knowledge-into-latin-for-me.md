I’d try ___felix in studio sapentiae___ _._ You could put _felix_  at the end instead of the beginning without changing the meaning.

_[Felix](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dfelix1)_  is somewhere in a region between “lucky”, “blessed”, and “fortunate.”

Studio is from _[studium](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=studium&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059)_ _;_ it’s both the root of our “study” but also implies zeal, enthusiasm and devotion.

Sapientiae is from _[sapientia](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=sapientia&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059)_ _,_ “wisdom” or “learning”
