For most of Egyptian history, the Pharoahs ruled -- officially at least -- as living gods, or at least as semi-divine beings who attained full divinity on their deaths. The pharoah was supposed to be the vital intermediary who represented humanity to the other gods while safeguarding _ma'at,_ the eternal divine order, on earth.

We can speculate on how, exactly, this is to be interpreted. Many Hellenistic kings and Roman emperors were also technically "gods" -- but, having a much wider variety of sources for the Greek and Roman periods, we know that this was at often regarded as a polite fiction (one Roman emperor on his deathbed joked "dear me, I'm afraid I'm becoming a god!"). In Egypt, we don't have a lot of the kind of literature that would tell us if Egyptians felt the same way -- the sources we have, which are composed mostly of official pronouncements and temple inscriptions, take the idea very seriously. One assumes that there was a variety of personal opinions on the matter, ranging from devout belief to skepticism ; but it's much harder to those in context.

The exact theological justification for the pharoahs' position varied over time. At different points in Egyptian history pharoahs were identifed with Horus, Ra, Amun and Osiris. However the institutional fact the the pharoah was the pinnacle of the Egyptian religion -- 'the chief priest of all temples', as one of the royal titles had it -- was pretty much a constant. In actual practice there were tensions between the pharoahs and the temple hierarchies, which were powerful, entrenched interests which didn't always want to do pharoah's will, even if they were theoretically his servants. Perhaps more importantly the intense conservatism of Egyptian society imposed a lot of brakes on the power of the pharoah, even if he was theoretically a divine being who could do as he pleased: the power of convention and tradition was greater than even the most strong willed pharoah, as [Akhenaten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten) found out the hard way.
