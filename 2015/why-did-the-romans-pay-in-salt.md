It's a very old tradition. One reason Rome was an important local power was it's position on the _[Via Salaria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Salaria)_ _,_  the "Salt Road" from the mountain settlements to the salt marshes at the mouth of the Tiber. As the other answers point out, salt is a critical preservative in antiquity and hard to come by if you live in a mountainous area. However the 'salary' (that's where our word come from) was not the only pay the soldiers received: they got rations and ordinary currency in historic times.

By way of an analogy, similar arrangements existed in the middle east and India. In Arab cultures I think "eating bread and salt of X" is an expression for "being in the employ" X; in India the expression "eating the salt of the Sirkar" meant "being in the employ of the government."
