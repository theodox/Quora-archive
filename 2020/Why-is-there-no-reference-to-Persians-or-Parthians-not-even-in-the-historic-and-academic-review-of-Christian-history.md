Persians feature quite prominently in the early history of Christianity — the [magi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magi), after all, were there in the manger.

In a more conventional historical sense, [Syriac language Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_Christianity#:~:text=Syriac%20Christianity%20(Syriac%3A%20%DC%A1%DC%AB%DC%9D%DC%9A%DC%9D%DC%98%DC%AC%DC%90%20%DC%A3%DC%98%DC%AA%DC%9D%DC%9D%DC%AC%DC%90,of%20%22the%20three%20most%20important) was widespread in Parthian and Sassanid territories. It was one of the four largest components of early Christianity (along with Greek, Latin and Coptic). About 20 of the bishops at the council of Nicaea in 325 will have been Sassanid Persian subjects, though most of them were Syriac rather than Persian speakers.

The modern [Church of the East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_East) is directly descended from the legally-recognized brand of Christianity tolerated by the Sassanians. That community was the matrix from which the Christian communities of Central Asia, China, and India all sprang. The use of Syriac rather than Persian as a liturgical language tends to disguise the ethnic makeup of the communities — but that actually goes way back into Persian imperial history: the citizens of the Achaemenid and Parthian empires were more likely to be literate in Aramaic (the ancestor of Syriac) than in Persian. So its unsurprising that a Christian community anywhere along the Silk Road would use Syriac rather than Persian as its written language of record. For example this Eastern Christian monument from China is written in Syriac:

But it includes clergy with Persian personal names like Jazedbuzid and Izadsafas.

Parthian Persia was, for the most part, a very open culture with a mix of languages, cultures and religions. However, Sassanian attitudes towards Christianity ran the gamut from alliance to hostility. Some rulers (particularly [Shapur_II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapur_II) and [Yazdegerd II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazdegerd_II)) persecuted their Christian subjects, often fearing that they were too close to their coreligionists on the Roman side of the border. Other rulers were more tolerant. Christianity survived as a tolerated but legally circumscribed religion in Persia down to the Arab conquest, where it essentially retained the same legal-but-second-class status.

It’s true that English language sources — which tend to inherit a view of Christian history centered in Latin, Catholic Rome — don’t put Persia’s Christian heritage front and center. For both political and theological reasons the Christian communities in the Persian Empire eventually came to define themselves in opposition to Roman — that is, what we’d call Orthodox — Christianity. But even there it’s hardly fair to say that they’re forgotten. [Saint Maruthas](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09748a.htm), for example (Catholic feast day: December 4) was Syriac Christian from what’s today Tikrit in Iraq; his book _[Acts of the Persian Martyrs](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/acts-of-the-persian-martyrs)_ __ is a key resource for the early history of Persian Christianity.

The [Encyclopedia Iranica ](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/christianity-index)has a good rundown of the sources and history of Iranian Christian communities.

_This illustrates neatly the complexity of Persian Christian heritage: It’s a decoration from a church in Irinjalakkuda, in southern India but the inscriptions are in Iranian_ _[Pahlavi script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pahlavi_scripts)_ _; or more precisely, they’re garbled copies of a Pahlavi original.
