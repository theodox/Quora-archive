I think [Jon Mixon](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jon-Mixon-1)'s answer lays out the main points of the 'No' camp very well. However the key assumption behind all 'No' answers is that the US remains absolutely committed to victory and uses the allies' key advantages to the utmost. Because the war was won -- and because the post-war world has generally taught us to see the war as a mythological struggle with the fate of the world hanging in the balance, we assume that war to the death is the only possible outcome. 

But it isn't, not really. 

Even an America which completely detested the Nazis could be forced to make terms if the military situation -- and with it, the political situation at home -- were sufficiently dire. The Union held enormous strategic advantages over the Confederacy in the American Civil War, but that didn't prevent the [Copperheads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copperhead_%28politics%29) from mounting a powerful challenge to Lincoln's war policies -- even while Sherman's army was cutting through the heart of the South. Had Sherman's march ended in a debacle -- say, a fluke of the battlefield turning [Kennesaw Mountain](http://www.civilwar.org/battlefields/kennesaw-mountain.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/) into another [Fredericksburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fredericksburg) -- things might have turned out differently.

Both the Western and Soviet halves of the WWII alliance worried obsessively about the possibility of a 'separate peace', and there's no question that either half of the alliance would have fared far worse without the other. Had the Soviets dropped out of the war (say, had the rumored [Stockholm meetings](http://www.historyandtheheadlines.abc-clio.com/contentpages/ContentPage.aspx?entryId=1145376&currentSection=1130224&productid=3) borne fruit) there would also be the question of how their friends in the west would react: while Stalin was fighting, the official line among communists in the west was of course in favor of fighting to the last ditch; but had Moscow changed it's mind, there is at least an open question as to what directives would have gone out to party apparatus in the west (the fate of France, which had the bad luck to fight the Germans while the Soviets were collaborating in the dismemberment of Poland, shows that at least some western Communists were willing to collaborate with the Nazis if ordered to by Moscow). 

Had the Nazis succeeded in forcing the Russians out of the war, the western appetite for a direct attack on France would have been diminished. Combine that with a catastrophic failure in Normandy, for example -- a scaled-up [Dieppe Raid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieppe_Raid), with the loss of 100,000 killed or captured -- would at the very least have discredited the military leadership of the western theater and set the stage for another two years of buildup, gloomy anticipation, and war-weariness. Would an American public watching the casualty counts mounting up on Okinawa be full of fire for a campaign in Persia against a Nazi satrapy in the Caucasus? Or would somebody come along to say "we have to focus on the war with Japan and shoring up our navy to protect us from Europe and all of its age old hatreds?" No amount of leadership -- however committed -- can stand against a people that becomes convinced a war is unwinnable. Luckily for us the Nazis had run out of astonishing victories early (indeed, they never scored another of their miraculous early-war successes after El Alamein and Stalingrad), but the God of Battles is fickle. 

So, TLDR: it was unlikely the Germans could win, but not impossible. A completely committed alliance did, definitively have the materiel and manpower to win the war. But complete commitment in politics is a fleeting, temporary thing that can be upset by events on the field or at home.
