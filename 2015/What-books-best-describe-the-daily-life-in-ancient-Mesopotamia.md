[The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character by Samuel Noah Kramer](http://www.amazon.com/Sumerians-History-Culture-Character-Phoenix-ebook/dp/B004LE97NC/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=) covers a lot of daily life because the unique nature of our cuneiform sources -- which often include things like legal contracts, accounting records, and even private correspondence -- give us a good first-hand look at Mesopotamian life which is often more intimate than the records of later cultures.

[Babylon: Mesopotamia and the Birth of Civilization by Paul Kriwaczek](http://amzn.to/1IVnZqd) is a pretty good general reader's history of the region (focused more on Babylon, obviously) with some social history interwoven. In a similar vein [Mesopotamia: The Invention of the City](http://amzn.to/1HQFrIt) by Gwendolyn Leick covers a lot of territory. Both books sometimes rely on a bit too much hand-wavey "must have been..." "one can imagine..." kind of speculation, which is inevitable to some degree but a bit much for my taste.

I haven't read [Everyday life in Ancient Mesopotamia](http://amzn.to/1IVoosT), but Jean Bottero was a highly respected author in the field so I'd assume its pretty good.
