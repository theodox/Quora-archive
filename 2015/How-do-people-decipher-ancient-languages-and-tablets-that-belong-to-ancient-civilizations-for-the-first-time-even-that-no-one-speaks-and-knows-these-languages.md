S0me great books on the topic include:

[Empires of the Plain: Henry Rawlinson and the Lost Languages of Babylon ](http://amzn.to/1Lu9BYc)

[Breaking the Maya Code ](http://amzn.to/1TT6fSg)

[Cracking the Egyptian Code: The Revolutionary Life of Jean-Francois Champollion](http://amzn.to/1TT6lJp)

[The Decipherment of Linear B](http://amzn.to/1fLlLQr)

You'll notice they frequently use the language of 'code cracking' which really means two things: 

First, you need a guess about which known language the script really relates to: like Coptic for Egyptian hieroglyhs, modern Mayan for the Maya glyphs, Greek for Linear B etc). Without a living -- or at least a known, dead language to work from -- you're pretty much stuck, as we have been with 
[Linear A](http://www.ancientscripts.com/lineara.html)

Then using a mixture of lucky correspondences (like [the Rosetta Stone](http://thehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) or the [Behistun Inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_Inscription)) and statistical analysis you find more and more plausible matches between symbols and sounds or ideas. This can be easy if the language is fairly well known, or hellaciously complex if the writing system is weird (Cuneiform was extremely hard because it sometimes syllabic like Japanese kana, sometimes ideographic like Chinese, and also is used for several unrelated languages). Usually it's a long, slow process that involves a lot of painstaking work.
