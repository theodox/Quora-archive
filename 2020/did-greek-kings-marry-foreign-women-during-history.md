There’s a lot of history to cover here, so the answer is not easily summed up into a single yes or no.

__Mythologically__ , there’s a good deal of intermarriage: for example [Perseus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus)married [Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(mythology)), who was an “Ethiopian” princess*, but he himself was 4 generations removed from Aegyptus, a king of Egypt; [Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theseus) married two foriegn royals, the Cretan princess [Phaedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedra_(mythology)) and the Amazon queen [Hippolyta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolyta); Achilles’ son [Neoptolemus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoptolemus) married (or at least, fathered children with) Hector’s wife [Andromache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromache). None of this is easy to read as real history, but it suggests that at the least in the oral traditions which preceded the revival of writing in Greece there was a general memory of Greek kings being part of an international web of alliances and relations in which marriage played a part. It’s certainly evidence that ideas about “racial” exclusivity would have been alien to pre-Classical Greece.

Monarchy mostly died out in Greece in the [Archaic period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Greece) (roughly, 800–500 BC) — during this era traditional kingships were mostly replaced by[ city-states with a limited form of republican government](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-explain-the-Political-structure-of-Ancient-Greece-in-layman-s-terms/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=748c66c1&srid=zLvM).

In __Sparta__ and __Crete__ monarchy survived but in a limited form; in both of those places the monarchs tended to act like other Greek aristocrats: They married mostly within their own social class and within their own city (rather than marrying foreign princesses for diplomatic reasons).

On the northern fringes of the Greek world, however, more traditional kinds of kingship survived in __Epirus__ and __Macedon__ . In both of these cases the monarchs did marry foreign women. Both of these kingdoms practiced polygamy (at least for royals) so their eventual makeup was quite complex: Two or three of Alexander the Great’s step-mothers** were foreign. Alexander himself married two foreign women, the Bactrian [Roxana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxana) and the Persian [Stateira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateira_II).

However in the wake of Alexander’s career attitudes changed: as his successors carved up his empire into a series of successor states in the [Hellenistic period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period#:~:text=The%20Hellenistic%20period%20covers%20the,Ptolemaic%20Egypt%20the%20following%20year), their attitudes towards royalty became increasingly exclusive. The most extreme example was the __Ptolemaic dynasty__  which ruled Egypt, where brother-sister marriages were the norm: this family tree of Cleopatra with the names removed makes the point very eloquently:

The __Seleucid__ dynasty was less extreme (and our records for them are less detailed). It appears that they didn’t practice Ptolemaic-style incest but — given the very limited pool of female names in their history— they seem to have limited their marriages to members of the Macedonian military aristocracy of their kingdom. There were two dynastic marriages with the Ptolemies and the Seleucids: Ptolemy II’s daughter [Berenice ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenice_(Seleucid_queen)#:~:text=Berenice%20(Ancient%20Greek%3A%20%CE%92%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%BA%CE%B7%2C,romanized%3A%20Berenik%C4%93)%20(%20c.&text=Around%20252%20BC%2C%20following%20the,the%20succession%20to%20Berenice's%20children)married [Antiochus II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_II_Theos), and Seleucid princess [Cleopatra_I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_I_Syra) married [Ptolemy V.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes)*** In __Macedon__ , the kings seem to have continued the older Macedonian practices of polygamy and diplomatic marriages. They Ptolemaic and Seleucid princesses both married into the Antigonid royal house, along with some aristocratic Greek women and at least one Illyrian princess.

Marriage diplomacy was more common in the smaller kingdoms on the fringes of the Greek world — “Greekified” kings like the royal house of [Bithynia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bithynia#Kingdom_of_Bithynia)and Greek dynasties ruling over a less-Greek population, like the kings of [Pergamon](https://www.livius.org/articles/dynasty/attalids/), tended to adopt much more flexible marriage strategies.

So, as a __TLDR__ : _some_  Greek kings were happy to marry foreign women; others went to rather extraordinary lengths to avoid doing so.



*The linked wiki article confidently assigns her to the Kingdom of Kush — at best that’s a modern interpretation. 
** [Audata ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audata)and [Meda ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meda_of_Odessos)for sure, and [Phila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phila_of_Elimeia) pronably came from a mixed family.
*** At this point the royal incest norm was so strong that Cleopatra was “promoted” to being a “sister” so she could marry Ptolemy.
