We lose track of the descendants of Cleopatra some time in the first century. She had four known children, but only one of them — her daughter with Marc Antony, known as [Cleopatra Selene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_Selene_II) — is known to have had children.

Cleopatra’s last clearly identifiable royal descendant is [Gaius Julius Alexio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Alexio), the priest-king of the Syrian city of Emesa. Alexio was Cleopatra’s great-great-great-grandson through Cleopatra Selene and King [Juba II of Mauretania.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II) Alexio lived at least until the 70’s of our era. Alexio had a son named Gaius Julius Fabia who may or may not have become king on his fathers death, but he is the last person who can be connected back to Cleopatra with no guesswork.

About two centuries later, [Queen Zenobia of Palmyra](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-Zenobia) claimed — on what evidence, we are not sure — to be a descendant of Cleopatra. She was connected with the royal family of Emesa in some fashion, but we don’t have any evidence for the family tree of the Emesan kingdom in the two centuries after Alexio. Since she (briefly) conquered Roman Egypt during the war, there’s reason to be sceptical: it could quite easily be a propaganda move to appeal to local sentiments — or it could simply be the kind of genealogical frippery which many rulers indulge in for reasons of prestige. Another reason to be sceptical is that one of the least popular Roman emperors, the notorious [Elagabalus, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus)was also connected to Emesan royal family — and nobody ever connected him to Cleopatra (for better or for worse). That suggests that the original line probably died out sometime in the second or early third century.

Cleopatra Selene had a twin brother, [Alexander Helios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Helios). He survived the loss of Egypt, but there is no evidence for what happened afterwards. A younger brother, [Ptolemy Philadelphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_Philadelphus_(son_of_Cleopatra)), is also said to have survived the war but likewise leaves no further traces in the historical record.

Cleopatra’s son with Julius Caesar, [Caesarion, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarion)disappeared after his mother and Mark Antony lost their kingdom in 30 BC. Some sources say he was killed in the aftermath, but others claim he escaped to India with part of the royal treasury. If he did, and if he had children there, there could be millions of people in India who are descendants of Cleopatra. It’s a good bet, however, that none of them have any idea of that.
