We don't have a complete one, but it's pretty certain that one (or more likely) several were made in antiquity. We know that the Aeneid was sometimes used as source material for Greek students trying to learn Latin; we've found few [papyrus fragments](http://enriqueta.man.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/ManchesterDev~93~3~23783~100438:Aeneid-fragment) of interliner or side-by-side translations that appear to be school editions. There are enough of these (dating up until the 5th century) that the text must have been reasonably accessible in Greek at that time.

However, a lot changed over the next 500 years. "Virgil" does not even show up in the [Suda, ](http://www.stoa.org/sol/)the great 10th century Byzantine encyclopedia except as Οὐεργίλιος: ὄνομα κύριον: "Virgil: a proper name". A bit earlier [Photios.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photios_I_of_Constantinople) the greatest scholar of 9th century Byzantium, could not read Latin but knew at least, who Virgil was.

The dating of the decline is probably significant: political and theological tensions between east and west were accelerating rapidly from the 9th century onwards so whatever Latin knowledge remained in Byzantium was probably regarded as outre, if not actually politically suspect.
