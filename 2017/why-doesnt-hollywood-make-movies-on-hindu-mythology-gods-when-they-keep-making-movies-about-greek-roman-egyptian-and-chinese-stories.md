You really don’t have to worry much about offending the Ancient Egyptian or Greco-Roman demographics — although the endless controversies involved in casting Egyptian-related movies have almost certainly guaranteed a slowdown in that genre for a while.

Nowadays Chinese-themed stories produced in the west have to tread very lightly — China has a booming movie business of its own, and zero hesitation in censoring depictions of China and Chinese culture they don’t like. Hollywood is rarely wiling to risk displeasing their second-largest market.

Creating a movie with Hindu deities that is both entertaining for a world-wide general audience and not going to create a serious backlash in India is at best a very, very tricky creative problem. You just need to consider the ongoing controversy — almost 30 years later — over [Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,](https://www.quora.com/Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom-What-do-Indians-think-of-this-movie) which was banned in India at the time of its release.
