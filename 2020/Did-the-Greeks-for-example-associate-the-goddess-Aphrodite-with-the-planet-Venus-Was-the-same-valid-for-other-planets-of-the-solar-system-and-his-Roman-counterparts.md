The associations all come from Babylonian astronomy. The Greeks just borrowed the idea and swapped in the name of gods and goddesses in their own pantheon who seemed like they corresponded to the Babylon originals â€” Aphrodite for [Ishtar](https://www.ancient.eu/ishtar/), Ares for [Nergal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nergal), and so on. The Romans did the same thing, using their local equivalents of the Greek gods.
