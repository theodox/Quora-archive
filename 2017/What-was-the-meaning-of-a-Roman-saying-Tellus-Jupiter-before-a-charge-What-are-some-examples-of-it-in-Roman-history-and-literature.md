The reference is to an ancient ritual recorded in the [Saturnalia of Macrobius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/3*.html#9), a 3rd century work (it’s more or less a critique of Vergil, but more like a rambling antiquarian blog).

Macrobius quotes what he says is an ancient ritual of _[devotio](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/devotio/)_ _,_ a kind of Roman banzai-charge in which a Roman “dedicated” — that is to say, sacrificed — himself and his enemies to the infernal gods for the good of the city. The most famous example is [Publius Decius Mus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Decius_Mus_(consul_312_BC)) who sacrificed himself in this way in battle against the Gauls in 312 BC (an event commemorated in [Livy](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=liv.%2010.28&lang=original) and in a [series of paintings by Rubens](http://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/peter_paul_rubens_the_decius_mus_cycle)). This theme of self-sacrifice is a key piece of Roman myth-making, appearing in Cicero, Livy and other accounts.

_Decius Mus (in red) receiving the consecration at Sentinum, according toRubens_ 

The exact text of the ritual is long and involved (our own [User-13584768854815474418](https://www.quora.com/profile/User-13584768854815474418) provides it in [User-13584768854815474418's answer to What were the most common prayers said by Roman citizens before Constantine?](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-most-common-prayers-said-by-Roman-citizens-before-Constantine/answer/User-13584768854815474418)) but it culminated in

_Tellus mater teque iuppiter obtestor,_ “you, mother Earth, and you bright Father (=’Jupiter’) bear witness” . Macrobius adds

_Cum Tellurem dicit, manibus terram tangit: cum Iovem dicit, manus ad caelum tollit: cum votum recipere dicit, manibus pectus tangi_ 

Having said “Earth”, he touched the earth with his hands; having said “Jove”, he lifted his hand to heaven, when said “receive the vow”, he touched his chest with his hands. And then - at least in the case of Decius Mus, he mounted his horse and charged headlong into the enemy ranks.
