# When victims of the Mt. Vesuvius eruption in Pompeii were killed by the lava, did the intense, sudden heat petrify or sear only the outside of their bodies and preserve their insides or did their whole bodies literally turn into hardened lava stone?

In the first stage of the eruption, the biggest danger was __asphyxiation__ . Huge volumes of ash produced by the eruption settled on the town — though probably 3/4 of the population fled before this reached dangerous levels. For those who stayed, however, collapsing roofs and suffocating levels of particulates in the air were very dangerous. Here’s a how Pliny the Elder died in Stabiae at the edge of the eruption zone — this actually happened on the second day of the eruption but it gives a sense of what was happening earlier closer to Vesuvius.

> They placed pillows on their heads and secured them with cloths, as a precaution against the falling bodies. Elsewhere the day had dawned by this time, but there it was still night, and the darkness was blacker and thicker than any ordinary night. This, however, they relieved as best they could by a number of torches and other kinds of lights. They decided to make their way to the shore, and to see from the nearest point whether the sea would enable them to put out, but it was still running high and contrary. A sheet was spread on the ground, and on this my uncle lay, and twice he called for a draught of cold water, which he drank. Then the flames, and the smell of sulphur which gave warning of them, scattered the others in flight and roused him. Leaning on two slaves, he rose to his feet and immediately fell down again, owing, as I think, to his breathing being obstructed by the thickness of the fumes and congestion of the stomach, that organ being naturally weak and narrow, and subject to inflammation. When daylight returned - two days after the last day he had seen - his body was found untouched, uninjured, and covered, dressed just as he had been in life. The corpse suggested a person asleep rather than a dead man.

The final extinction event, however, was more more sudden and violent.

About 12 hours after the eruption began, the volcano began to release a series of __[pyroclastic flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow)__  — superheated gasses reaching temperatures near 1,000 °C / 1,830 °F. These slid down the mountain at very high speeds, as much as 80 km or 50 mi / hr. Lava tends to be much heavier and much slower — it’s generally easier to for humans to avoid. Pompeii’s flows were several meters deep — impossible to escape if you were in their path.

There were twelve of these flows at irregular intervals over the next day. Each one killed everyone in its path: even people who had taken refuge in solid buildings — now cushioned by a meter or more of ash — were killed by the intense temperatures and lack of oxygen in the path of the flow.

The surge that hit Pompeii was relatively weak: probably about 300 degrees centigrade and not carrying enough solid material to wipe away buildings but enough to kill unprotected people outside and suffocate those trapped indoors. Others, like the one that hit Herculaneum, were hotter — hot enough to fuse a basket of coins, say, into a solid mass.

Despite the heat, the lack of oxygen within the flow meant that many of the bodies didn’t actually incinerate. They were still more or less intact when the subsequent ash falls buried the city 7 meters (21 feet) deep.

When the bodies eventually decayed their positions were still imprinted in the ash, which eventually solidified. The most eloquent memorial of the victims are the many __plaster casts which archaeologists have made by filling the human-shaped cavities in the ash layer__ .
