The original is in Boswell and it makes the intent pretty clear:

> Damages will be given to a man who is calumniated in his lifetime, because he may be hurt in his worldly interest, or at least hurt in his mind : but the law does not regard that uneasiness which a man feels on having his ancestor calumniated. That is too nice. Let him deny what is said, and let the matter have a fair chance by discussion. But if a man could say nothing against a character but what he can prove, history could not be written ; for a great deal is known of men of which proof cannot be brought. A minister may be notoriously known to take bribes, and yet you may not be able to prove it." Mr. Murray suggested that the author should be obliged to show some sort of evidence, though he would not require a strict legal proof ; but Johnson firmly and resolutely opposed any restraint whatever, as adverse to a free investigation of the characters of mankind.

Johnson believed that applying the kind of strict libel standards which then (and to some extent today) prevailed in English law would have a chilling effect on the discussion of people and history. It’s hard to produce a judgement on another human being’s whole life that meets the evidentiary bar you’d expect for a trial.

It’s like what would happen to Quora if you banned all generalizations.
