Never underestimate people's ingenuity and determination just because they lived long ago. 

You don't need aliens or the supernatural, you just need human willpower. Consider what we know about how the Egyptians quarried and moved their obelisks: these massive stones , as heavy as 500 tons, had to from their quarries to distant cities and the placed upright without shattering or toppling. Here's a Greek description of how it was done in Ptolemaic Egypt (a thousand years or more after the real Egyptian golden age, but more than two thousand years ago):



>  PtolemÃ¦us Philadelphus had one erected at Alexandria, eighty cubits high [about 150 feet] which had been prepared by order of King Necthebis:... For this purpose, a canal was dug from the river Nilus to the spot where the obelisk lay; and two broad vessels, laden with blocks of similar stone a foot square, the cargo of each amounting to double the size, and consequently double the weight, of the obelisk, were brought beneath it; the extremities of the obelisk remaining supported by the opposite sides of the canal. The blocks of stone were then removed, and the vessels, being thus gradually lightened, received their burden. It was erected upon a basis of six square blocks, quarried from the same mountain, and the artist was rewarded with the sum of fifty talents [300 pounds of silver].



Here's the same task, Renaissance style: [Moving an Obelisk](http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi370.htm)

It's certainly "miraculous" that these projects were done -- in the Egyptian case, by people without even steel for tools or gears for machinery. But the miracle isn't the movement of the stones. It's the problem solving skills of very smart, very determined people. 

It's cool to speculate on levitation, alien astronauts, etc -- life would be more fun if it were true. But it's also a dis-service to our ancestors, who achieved amazing things with far fewer resources than we have. Don't confuse our wealth and our access to information as evidence of our being smarter than our forebearers.
