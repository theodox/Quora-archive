It allowed the first really serious step forward in [deciphering Egyptian Hieroglyphics. ](https://www.quora.com/How-were-the-Hieroglyphics-deciphered/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=391c9e0f&srid=zLvM)Since the stone contained the same text three time — once in Greek, once in hieroglyphics, and once in another form of Egyptian called Demotic.

There are [actually several other multi-lingual inscriptions](https://www.quora.com/How-would-our-understanding-of-the-ancient-world-Egypt-change-if-the-Rosetta-Stone-was-never-discovered/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=2c0bc5fd&srid=zLvM) in Egypt which would have worked just as well — but the Rosetta stone was the first one which made its way into the hands of scholars who had enough information to put the pieces back together.
