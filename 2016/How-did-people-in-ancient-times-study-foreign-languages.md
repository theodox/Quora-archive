They did it “the old fashioned way.” That is to say, we know at least that they had parallel vocabulary lists and did sentence-by-sentence translation pretty much exactly the way I did in school.

_A bilingual Akkadian-Sumerian word list for students_ 

This goes pretty much _all the way back_ , too: one reason we know Sumerian fairly well — despite the fact that it’s a completely unique language with no known relatives, living or dead — is that countless generations of Akkadian speakers cranked out word lists and even school exercises which have survived: Here’s a little bit of schoolboy Sumerian practice from a Babylonian _edubba_  or “tablet house”, ca 2000 BC:

> Young man, are you a student?

> I am a student.

> If you are a student, do you know Sumerian?

> I speak Sumerian

> You are young, how do you speak it so well?

> I have listened carefully to my teacher’s instructions

This should be instantly familiar to most modern language learners; evidently the stilted practice dialog is an eternal form. Even the trendy technique of “full immersion,” had a Babylonian analogue:

> The teacher of Sumerian said, “He spoke Akkadian!” Then he caned me.

Ok, so a little has changed.

Typically once a Babylonian or Assyrian student had basic Sumerian vocabulary and grammar down they would write out model essays (probably from dictation rather than copying).

A similar strategy was used by Greeks trying to learn Latin and Latin speakers learning Greek. A few of these texts have survived, mostly thanks to Irish monks who copied them out during the depths of the dark ages for their own language learning programs.

_Greek (left) and Latin (right) conjugation of the Greek verb χαρίζομαι — this bit was for Latin speakers learning Greek, since it’s transliterated into Roman characters. “I give, You give, he/she/it gives, we give…” and so on._ 

In addition to word lists and dialogues we also know that grammatical works were prepared. The grammar of [Dositheus Magister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dositheus_Magister), for example, was a Greek edition of a Latin manual made to aid Greek students.
