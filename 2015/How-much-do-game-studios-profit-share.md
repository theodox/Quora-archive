Here's a good look at a nice way to do it (there's a link there to the actual scheme) : [In Bad Times And In Good Times](http://undeadlabs.com/2010/12/news/in-bad-times-and-in-good-times/)

I'd say about a quarter of companies try to be this good (though few are as transparent). About half of all companies mix profit shares into the general bonus scheme, which is not awful but can easily be gamed by office politics and technicalities about seniority or assignment (does the IT person get as big a share as a designer? What about the receptionist?)

The remaining 25 percent of companies are basically not sharing profits in any way - usually be setting impossible targets for what constitutes 'sharing'

Of course, there are similar ambiguities in the relationship between developers and publishers about what constitutes "profit" for purposes of royalties. Moderately successful games may not actually earn a lot of royalties over their development advance. Games that don't do well may not see any "profits" to share.
