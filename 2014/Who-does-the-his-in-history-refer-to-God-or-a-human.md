Neither. It comes from _historia_ , Greek for 'researches' or 'inqiuiries'. Herodotus, the Greek writer referred to as "the father of history", used that word to refer to his book about the Persian Wars, and it stuck.

Ironically, one of Herodotus's weaknesses as a historian was his habit of guessing at the etymology of words... one that humanity has not outgrown :)
