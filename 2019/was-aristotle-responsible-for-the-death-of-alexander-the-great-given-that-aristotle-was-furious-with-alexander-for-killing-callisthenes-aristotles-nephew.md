It’s very unlikely.

__Sources__ 

There are two primary sources source for the story, and they are both highly skeptical.

The first is [Arrian](https://archive.org/stream/L269ArrianAnabasisOfAlexanderI57/L269-Arrian%20Anabasis%20of%20Alexander%20I%3A5-7#page/n305/mode/2up), 7.27:

> I am aware that much else has been written about Alexander's death: for instance, that Antipater sent him some medicine which had been tampered with and that he took it, with fatal results. Aristotle is supposed to have made up this drug, because he was already afraid of Alexander on account of Callisthenes' death, and Antipater's son Cassander is said to have brought it. Some accounts declare that he brought it in a mule's hoof, and that it was given Alexander by Cassander's younger brother Iolas, who was his cup-bearer and had been hurt by him in some way shortly before his death

The context in which he mentions this, however, is dismissive: he lists a couple of other theories as well, and concludes:

> I have recorded these things in order so show I know of them, not because they are trustworthy accounts

The other is [Plutarch](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/10.htmlhttp://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/10.html):

> And as for suspicions of poisoning, no one had any immediately, but five years afterwards, as we are told, upon information given, Olympias put many men to death, and scattered abroad the ashes of Iolas, alleging that he had administered the poison. But those who affirm that Aristotle counselled Antipater to do the deed, and that it was entirely through his agency that the poison was provided, mention one Hagnothemis as their authority, who professed to have heard the story from Antigonus the king….

But he goes on to say

> Most writers, however, think that the story of the poisoning is altogether a fabrication; and it is no slight evidence in their favour that during the dissensions of Alexander's commanders, which lasted many days, his body, although it lay without special care in places that were moist and stifling, showed no sign of such a destructive influence, but remained pure and fresh.

Other accounts — most notably the [Roman historian Trogus](http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/english/trans12.html), but also “Alexander Romance”, the highly fictionalized biography that circulated in the Middle Ages— blamed Antipater and Cassander without mentioning Aristotle.

__Modern views__ 

Modern historians are as skeptical as Arrian and Plutarch.

Poisoning was a common explanation for high-profile deaths in antiquity, [but the accounts of Alexander’s death don’t strike most modern toxicologists as poison](https://blog.oup.com/2014/02/death-alexander-the-great-poison/). Most ancient accounts show Alexander exhibiting a high fever, which would not be characteristic of most of the poisons which were common in Greece. Moreover Alexander was ill for more than ten days before he died — a slow death for a poison that was supposedly so toxic it had to be carried in a hollowed-out mule’s hoof.

__Origins__ 

There are, however, a couple of clues which might explain how this story spread.

The story first appears in connection with Alexander’s mother Olympias and her arch-rival, the viceroy Antipater. Each hated the other while Alexander was alive; after Antipater’s death Olympias fought a war against his son Cassander. The ‘five years’ in Plutarch’s mention corresponds exactly to the brief period in 318–317 when she had the upper hand in the struggle. The story about her spreading Iolas’ ashes — and the deaths of ‘many others’ — reflects a purge of Antipater’s supporters during her brief ascendancy. Blaming Antipater’s family for her son’s death would have been a natural PR choice for Olympias: it was intended to rally support to the royal family (Alexander’s wife and son were with Olympias at the time) and to turn the Macedonian people against Cassander.

In Plutarchs’ version “Hagnothemis” — otherwise unknown — claimed his authority for the story is [Antigonus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigonus_I_Monophthalmus), another of Alexander’s warring field marshals. During the time when Olympias and Cassander were first fighting, Antigonus was also an ally of Cassander against Olympias. But, by 315, Antigonus and Cassander were themselves at war — a conflict which would come and go for the next decade and a half. In that context, the already-circulating poisoning accusations were a valuable propaganda tool both for blackening the reputation of an enemy and for distancing Antigonus from his former ally.

After 310–309, the poisoning story took on another overtone. In that year Cassander ordered the deaths of [Alexander’s wife, his legitimate son and his illegitimate son](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-the-descendants-of-Alexander-the-Great/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=01040a68&srid=zLvM). Macedonian opinion was horrified at Cassander’s extinction of the royal house, so Antigonus had every reason to spread the poisoning story: it helped distance himself from an unpopular former colleague as well as painting an enemy in the darkest tones possible.

Since Cassander had also been a student of Aristotle’s, adding the philosopher as a co-conspirator lent a touch of circumstantial detail (like the mule’s hoof) to spice up the tale. It also made a political point: Antigonus was older than Alexander and was associated with the feudal, military side of Macedonian life dating back to the days of Phillip II, not the urban culture represented by Aristotle. Including the philosopher in the plot emphasized a contrast that played well with the opinion of Macedonian military. The fact that Aristotle was not around to deny it — he died only a year after Alexander, well before the rumors began to become widespread — was an added bonus.

The military and political conflict between Cassander and Antigonus turned into a generational affair: after many twists and turns, Antigonus’ son [Demetrius the Beseiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_I_of_Macedon) murdered Cassander’s son [Alexander V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_V_of_Macedon) and replaced him on the throne of Macedon, ensuring that the Antigonid version of events would not be forgotten — even if later generations viewed it with jaundiced eyes.
