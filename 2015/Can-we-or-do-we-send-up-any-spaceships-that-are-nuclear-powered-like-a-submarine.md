On the "who thought that was a good idea?" Front there is also [Project Orion](https://what-if.xkcd.com/7/). a cold-war era plan to propel spacecraft by -- I kid you not -- pushing atomic bombs out of the back hatch and detonating them.

The British had their own version as well, [Project Daedalus](http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/projects/project-daedalus), but they took the manly option and wanted to usion hydrogen bombs

Daedalus also gave birth to [Project Icarus](http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/projects/project-icarus), an international design along similar lines bringing the modern, global spirit to bouncing along through space on an H-bomb shockwave.
