The recorded instances of inter-communal fighting in Alexandria date from the Roman, not the Ptolemaic period. But they were quite serious — the riots in 38 are frequently known as the “[first pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandrian_riots_(38)).”

Jews occupied an interesting, ambiguous place in Egypt. The Jewish community there predates Alexander; the [Elephantine papyri, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantine_papyri)for example, show a sizable Jewish settlement in Upper Egypt that predates the Persian conquest. Its usually believed that Alexander invited Jews to Alexandria when the city was founded, though the sources which say that clearly are about 300 years after the fact. On the other hand it’s definitely known that Ptolemy I imported large numbers of Jews — as captives: he conquered Palestine in 320 BCE.

Despite that unpromising start, Ptolemy used Jewish soldiers as garrison troops in Egypt (this is less surprising than it seems; Roman armies, for example, were always full of former enemies). Relations warmed up further under Ptolemy II, who famously [commissioned the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible](http://www.livius.org/sources/about/septuagint/). For the next 300 years, more and more Jews moved to Egypt; for a while Egypt even boasted [a rival to the Temple in Jerusalem](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9772-leontopolis). The Jewish writer [Philo](http://www.iep.utm.edu/philo/), who chronicled the riots of the year 38, claimed there were a million Jews in Egypt in his time; if true that would make them about 12% of the population.

_Alexandria, with the Jewish quarter to the northeast_ 

In many ways the Jews of Egypt did well for themselves. Philo himself was clearly the product of an elite education, writing elegant philosophical Greek for an international audience. His nephew [Tiberius Julius Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Julius_Alexander), served as Roman Procurator (which means he had the substantial property qualification of a Roman _eques_ ). Nonetheless, Alexandria was not a happy multicultural melange: it was a segregated city with separate quarters and institutions for its Greek, Jewish and Egyptian residents. The city’s official culture and civic institutions were only for Greeks and those who were both willing and able to pass as Greeks. This was a colonial society with the tensions and contradictions inherent in a segregated world. Supremacists, assimilationists and rejectionists all jostled for position on a very unequal playing field where only a “Hellene” —a status the other Hellenes could offer or deny as they wished — could be a full citizen. Voting right, high office, and the economic advantages that came with political equality were jealously guarded privileges for Greeks alone.

This messy situation got nastier after the Roman conquest. The Romans in this period were also suspicious of the Jews — they were suspicious of any strong national consciousness among their subjects (Tiberius, for example, expelled the Jews from Rome in the year 19; Claudius would do so again around 49). The Alexandrian Greeks, on the other hand, were smarting from the discovery that their wealth and culture didn’t carry much weight with the new overlords: after three centuries on top of the social pyramid they were suddenly just another bunch of provincials. Over the next hundred and fifty years they would go on to develop a [lively literature](http://amzn.to/2hPv5ZA) featuring stories (some apocryphal, some not) in which bold Alexandrians speak truth to Roman power and (usually) end up dead.

__The riots of 38__ 

The first major outbreak of violence came shortly after Caligula ascended the throne in 37. He began experimenting with the enforcement of the imperial cult. Augustus and Tiberius had allowed provincials to offer sacrifices and offerings (which were [part and parcel of a lot of Hellenistic politics](https://www.quora.com/Why-were-Roman-emperors-considered-to-be-gods-or-godlike)) but Caligula demanded them. The Roman governor of Egypt, [Aulus Avilius Flaccus ](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6163-flaccus)was in disfavor with Caligula, and he seems to have decided to coerce the Jews into emperor-worship as a means of securing his position with a new emperor — even though there was a policy dating back to Augustus’ day that allowed the Jews to offer sacrifices “on the emperor’s behalf” rather than to him. [Caligula was not impressed](http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book40.html):

> “Granted,” said he, “that this is true and that you have offered sacrifices. But it was to another God, even if it was on my behalf. What is the good of that? You have not sacrificed to me.”

> _Embassy to Gaius, XLV_ 

However, Philo [claimed that the ultimate origins of the violence were with the Alexandrian Greeks](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Philo/in_Flaccum*.html). He describes Flaccus being courted by his Alexandrian advisors:

> you have no chance of favour with the emperor, therefore we must find another advocate, by whom [Caligula] may be made propitious to us, and that advocate is the city of Alexandria, which all the family of Augustus has honoured from the very beginning, and our present master above all the rest; and it will be a sufficient mediator in our behalf, if it can obtain one boon from you — and you cannot confer a greater benefit upon it than by abandoning and denouncing all the Jews

> _Against Flaccus, 22_ 

There were several Alexandrian freedmen at Caligula’s court, so it’s possible that there was some serious political calculation involved.

However, there was a darker undercurrent as well. One of the envoys the Alexandrians sent to Gaius in the aftermath of the riots was [Apion](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1641-apion), a popular author but also an outspoken anti-Semite given to circulating dubious stories, such as that the Jews worshipped a golden donkey’s head — and, more seriously, that the Jews performed human sacrifices and conspired against all Greek everywhere. Several of the scurrilous stories attributed to Apion clearly go back to the [Maccabean Revolt](http://www.ancient.eu/article/827/) of a hundred and fifty years before, which suggests the existence of an organized body of anti-Semitic opinion in the Greek world of the first century. This provided a fertile ground for this and future outbreaks of violence.

__Street warfare in 66.__ 

The [second major outbreak of violence was in 66](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/pogrom-in-alexandria/). This began with street violence (initiated, its said, by the Greeks) it ended when Tiberius Alexander — Philo’s apostate nephew — brought in the two legions to “enforce the peace,” leaving 50,000 Jews dead and the city’s Jewish quarters in ruins.

Our sources are not clear about how this related to the outbreak of the [First Jewish–Roman War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War) in Judea, which happened the same year. It’s possible that the riots reflected rising Jewish xenopobia in the run-up to the war, or if the riots happened after hostilities had started, it could be that Greek extremists saw the war in Judea as an excuse for violence at home. In either case Alexander’s reaction was so bloody because he had to prove his own bonafides as a Roman loyalist. He made it so clear where his loyalties that he eventually served as second in command of the Roman army at the taking of Jerusalem.

__Ethnic cleansing in 116__ 

The cycle of violence reached its bitter climax fifty years later, with the [Kitos War. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War)This was the last and most violent of the Greek-Jewish conflicts in Alexandria.

The conflict began in 115 with a violent anti-tax protest, but it quickly escalated into a full scale guerilla uprising. Emperor Trajan was fighting the Parthians in Mesopotamia where there were significant Jewish communities, generally loyal to their Parthian overlords. These rose up behind the Roman armies, inspiring violence among embittered Jews in Roman territory. The memory of the destruction of the Temple made this conflict particularly brutal, and the fighting spread through the diaspora.

In Cyprus there was a rising so violent that in later times Cypriot law said that not only were Jews forbidden to set foot on the island, even any Jew were shipwrecked and cast ashore he would be put to death. In Libya, the rebel Jew [Lukuas ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lukuas)proclaimed himself king and launched another bitter campaign against the Greek and Roman settlements there. Greek historians embroidered tales of Jewish cruelty with literary excess — but the archaeological record confirms a swath of destruction and after the war several cities in Libya had to be repopulated by Hadrian.

Lukuas’ forces headed east and found support in the Egyptian countryside. All over Egypt there was fighting between local militias and Jewish rebels, and the Jews seems to have had the upper hand in the first months of the fighting. The viciousness of the conflict (and, perhaps, the persistence of older accusations) is captured in a [fragmentary letter from a Greek woman to her son ](http://www.papyri.info/hgv/19426)praying “with the will of the gods, above all Hermes the invincible, _may they not roast you._ ”

While the fighting continued in the hinterland, the Greeks of Alexandria massacred the city’s Jewish community.

The war in the countryside ground on for another year, but a Roman expeditionary force stamped out the rebellion in 117. As measured by the receipts for the _fiscus Iudaeorum_ , the special head-tax Jews were required to pay, it seems as if the Jews of Egypt were basically wiped out. The Greek writer [Appian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appian)of Alexandria — who narrowly escaped Jewish fighters himself — speaks simply of “Trajan having extinguished the Jewish nation in Egypt”.
