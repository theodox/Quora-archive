He’d probably have been able to figure it out, though he might find it irritatingly Ionic or Attic in it’s choice of spellings. He would presumably have some experience with the typical Doric vs Ionic/Attic dialectical differences; Koine was [mostly based on a mix of Attic and Ionic.](https://www.quora.com/Who-created-the-Koine-Greek-Writing-Why-was-it-written-more-like-Hieroglyphics-and-Demotic-than-its-mainland-Greece-dialectic-writing-Why-were-most-ancient-mainland-Greeks-not-able-to-read-Koine/answer/Steve-Theodore) For the most part these were [familiar differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doric_Greek#morphology): Attic _μἡτηρ_ versus Doric ματερ and so on, with a few localisms and some minor differences in verb forms; all told, maybe less of a delta than between London and Glasgow today.

The traditional letter forms would be mostly familiar with a few substitutions that he would probably recognize from Attic:

his theta was a__𐤈__ rather than __ϴ__ 

his ksi was __Χ__  rather than __Ξ__ 

correspondingly his chi __Ψ__  rather than __Χ__ 

his eta might have been __𐌇__  rather than __Η__ 

Additionally , he might not recognize __Ω__  — his writing would have just used __O.__

_This Spartan inscription from Delos, in a Koine version, would be ΚΑΙ ΤΩN ΧΡΕΜΑΤΩΝ ΤΩΝ ΤΟΥ ΘΕΟΥ ΕΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΟΝ ΑΓΙΣ ΠΑΥΣΑΝΙΑΣ ΕΦΟΡΟΙ ΗΣΑΝ. It shows a mix of Doric and Ionic spellings, the melding that would eventually become koine. Photo:_ _[Scuola Normale Superiore](http://mnamon.sns.it/index.php?page=Esempi&id=12&lang=en#20)_ 

A lot would depend on the age of the manuscript too: the later Ptolemaic period and the early Roman era saw a large expansion of the use of papyrus as a writing material. This, in turn, encourage the development of a more fluid style of handwriting which would further confuse him. He came from a world where scratching on potsherds was the most common form of writing; cursive penmanship would definitely be alien to him.

_Leonidas could probably read the Greek text inscribed on the Rosetta Stone (leftmost column) but the gradual evolution of round forms in the next columns, which start in the second century and end in the 10th) would probably puzzle him a good deal.

Since the language would still be familiar (though many aspects of the mental background of the Septuagint might not be) it would not take more than a little help with letter forms and orthography to get Leonidas started. At least in Alexandria he’s have been able to find a scholar or two who were familiar with his Laconian dialect to help him out; in first-century BC Alexandria, for example he could look up Philoxenus, who literally wrote the book on Spartan dialectical peculiarities.



And heck, __[as a Jew, Leonidas would obviously have a built-in advantage in reading the Bible](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-facts-about-Spartans/answer/Steve-Theodore)__ . A Passover seder matching the famously taciturn author of _μολὼν λαβέ_ and his infinitely prolix “coreligionist” [Philo of Alexandria](https://www.quora.com/Did-Philo-of-Alexandria-create-Jesus-Christ/answer/Steve-Theodore) is the funniest idea since [Lysistrata](https://www.worldhistory.org/Lysistrata/).
