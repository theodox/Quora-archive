My read is _very_  tentative — there are bunch of ways you could divide the words and with so little context it’s hard to know. I think the words are

_Σεμνη ὤρα πρώτου ὡς_ 

___[Σεμνη](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=semnos&la=greek#lexicon)___ __ is probably “revered” or “holy”

__[ὤρα](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=w%29%2Fra&la=greek&can=w%29%2Fra0)__ ____ is probably “care” or “concern” . If I’m dividing this right _Σεμνη_ is grammatically a modifier on _ὤρα ,_ something like “sacred care”. However there’s no verb so it’s hard to be sure

__πρώτου__ means“of the first” or “of the earliest” (in an earlier version of this I incorrectly transcribed it as _προ του, “of the” —_ thanks to [Evangelos Lolos](https://www.quora.com/profile/Evangelos-Lolos) for catching that).

___ὡς___ ____ would be “as” if it’s a complete word.

From the design this is almost certainly an early Christian grave marker.
