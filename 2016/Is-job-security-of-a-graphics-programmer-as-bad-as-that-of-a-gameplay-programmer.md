Graphics is generally regarded as a harder, more esoteric job than gameplay programming. To be a good graphics person you need more math skills, a deeper knowledge of hardware details, and the ability to work in very restrictive langauages like HLSL instead of general purpose languages like C++.

For all these reasons, there are fewer graphics programmers than gameplay coders by a pretty wide margin. They are usually more sought after and better paid- though they are also expected to perform at a high level: if your shaders or your renderer don't run fast or look good it will be obvious to everybody.

Graphics has been one of the highest-status jobs in games for a decade or more. That may decline now that so many rendererd use the same basic architecture and physically based shaders. For now, though, it's a plum job if you can do it.
