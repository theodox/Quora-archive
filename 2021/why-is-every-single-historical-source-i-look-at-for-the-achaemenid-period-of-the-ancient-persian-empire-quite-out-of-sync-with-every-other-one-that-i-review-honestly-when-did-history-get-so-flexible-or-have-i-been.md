# Why is every single historical source I look at for the Achaemenid period of the ancient Persian empire quite out of sync with every other one that I review? Honestly. When did history get so flexible? Or have I been missing something all along?

Unfortunately the contemporary source material for the Achaemenid era is very scarce. Persian language sources are extremely rare — you can find almost all of them here;



however they aren’t generally great reads; they are mostly royal inscriptions of the ‘l defeated king so-and-so’ variety. The only contemporary sources that read like history are all Greek — mainly Herodotus and Xenophon. They were outsiders, and of course they saw the Persians through a lens tinted with fear and envy. There are some later Persian sources that talk about Achaemenid matters but they of centuries later than the events they describe — they show the kind of murkiness that comes from a historical tradition being passed down orally for several hundred years.

The scarcity of the sources, combined with the obvious limitations of the few we do have, leaves a lot of room for interpretation.

It also doesn’t help that the glories of ancient Persia have modern implications— not just in Iran but in the wider Persian cultural sphere from India to Central Asia. It’s not hard to find people who want to boost or denigrate the Achaemenids for reasons that little to do with historical accuracy.

if you need a solid starting place, the Cambridge History of Iran (volumes 1 &2) is a good, if dry place to start.



for individual items the Encyclopedia Iranica is a great online reference
