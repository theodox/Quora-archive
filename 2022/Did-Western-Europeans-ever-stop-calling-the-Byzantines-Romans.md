Not really, although by around the 9th century the term had already become one that could be deployed sarcastically as well as respectfully. The perfect example is the notorious “diplomat” Liutprand of Cremona, an ambassador of the Ottonian emperors to Constantinople. [Here is his way of using the word Roman ](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/liudprand-embassy-excerpts.asp)In 963:

> History tells us that Romulus, from whom the Romans get their name, was a fratricide born in adultery. He made a place of refuge for himself and received into it insolvent debtors, runaway slaves, murderers and men who deserved death for their crimes. This was the sort of crowd whom he enrolled as citizens and gave them the name of Romans. From this nobility are descended those men whom you style 'rulers of the world.' But we Lombards, Saxons, Franks, Lotharingians, Bavarians, Swabians and Burgundians, so despise these fellows that when we are angry with an enemy we can find nothing more insulting to say than -'You Roman!' For us in the word Roman is comprehended every form of lowness, timidity, avarice, luxury, falsehood and vice.

Proof, if proof were needed, yet that Twitter merely commodified rather than inventing a strain of nastiness that has been around forever. Generally “Roman” was the proper formal form of address when speaking to or about the Byzantines. Using “Greek” instead was a calculated insult in most contexts — Liutprand intentionally used it to rile up his Byzantine host, Nicephorus.

That pattern tended to remain down to the end: “Romans” for politeness and “Greeks” for insults, though there are exceptions. As far as I’m aware no one ever used “Byzantines,” a [coinage of the 16th century.](https://byzantium.gr/history.html)
