The last public number I know of was about 40,000 in 2007, but that was a period of expansion and also before the explosion of smaller independent games. Today's number in North America is in the ballpark of 50,000, but that's a very fuzzy number. The traditional big AAA game industry has contracted from a peak around 2010, although it's on the mend right now; meanwhile many small independent developers have joined the business without joining the industry, so to speak. If you count everybody who makes a game and hopes to sell it that number could be several tens of thousands higher; if you only count people who actually pay their rent by being developers the number might only be 45,00 or so. 

There there many thousands, if not tens of thousands, who try the to make games for a living for a few years and then drop out -- the average indie developer only makes about $11,000 a year, per the [Game Developer Salary Survey](http://www.gamasutra.com/salarysurvey2014.pdf). Retention in the industry has improved but it's notoriously been bad for a long time: even though the crunch-time horror stories in the news 10 years ago have lessened, the business still involves long hours, high stress, and has a relatively flat career path: for an average developer the 'career ladder' may only have 3 rungs: grunt, lead, and director -- there is no game programming or art equivalent of 'assistant regional vice president', apart from a few people who do central tech direction for big worldwide companies. All that adds up to a high dropout rate, particularly one people reach child-bearing age.
