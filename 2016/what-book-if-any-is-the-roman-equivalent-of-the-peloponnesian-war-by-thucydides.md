 [Sallust ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallust)is sometimes compared to Thucydides for both his very terse style and his philosophical and moral pessimism (and like Thucydides, his practical career was pretty checkered). His subjects are less grandiose but he shares Thucydides' interest in the effects of passion and conflict on political decision makers.

[Tacitus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus) is another example of the jaded, detached view associated with Thucydides... They've been lumped together as [historians of disillusionment](https://classicsvic.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/whitehousevol20.pdf).

Among Greek writes of Roman history, [Polybius ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius)is probably the most Thucydidean historian of Roman history -very analytical and schematic on his approach.

Much later, [Ammianus Marcellinus ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammianus_Marcellinus)was a Thucydides fan, but unfortunately is also sometimes as prone to clunky phrasing. His reputation has fluctuated a lot over time but he is still clearly trying to put himself in the Thucydidean tradition.
