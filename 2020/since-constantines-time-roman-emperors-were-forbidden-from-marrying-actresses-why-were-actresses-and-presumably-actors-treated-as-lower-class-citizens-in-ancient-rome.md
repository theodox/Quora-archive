# Since Constantine's time, Roman emperors were forbidden from marrying actresses. Why were actresses (and presumably actors) treated as lower class citizens in ancient Rome?

For most of the Hellenistic and Roman eras, acting was legally and socially in the same bucket as prostitution.

It’s not quite clear exactly when this stigma emerged. It may ultimately go back to the association between Greek drama and the cult of Dionysus, which included a lot of excesses of all kinds (and which was briefly, but violently suppressed by the Roman government around the time of the second Punic War). There was certainly some guilt-by-association with related crafts: musicians and dancers were commonly associated with a louche, partying lifestyle (“[sending for the flute girls](https://theconversation.com/elite-companions-flute-girls-and-child-slaves-sex-work-in-ancient-athens-89306)” meant your dignified Athenian symposium was about to turn into an orgy). Above all, it didn’t help that male actors played most female roles well into the imperial period. In a culture where “manliness” was a key part of public self-presentation, cross-dressing was seen with deep suspicion.

In any case, the identification of actors as shady characters was firm in the Roman mind by the Later republic. “Theater people” were stereotypically un-Roman; associating with them made you look raffish at best. You can hear this sniffs in [Plutarch’s depiction of Sulla,](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Sulla*.html) for example:

> he consorted with actresses, harpists, and theatrical people, drinking with them on couches all day long. For these were the men who had most influence with him now: Roscius the comedian, Sorex the archmime, and Metrobius the impersonator of women, for whom, though past his prime, he continued up to the last to be passionately fond, and made no denial of it.

Romans were also extremely sensitive to the class-politics involved in public performance. The were well aware that comedy (which had always had a strong community aspect, going all the way back to Aristophanes in Athens) allowed the otherwise disenfranchised to poke fun at the ruling class. For example [Suetonius records this about Augustus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html), right after noting his sponsorship of the theater:

> … he was so strict in curbing the lawlessness of the actors, that when he learned that Stephanio, an actor of Roman plays, was waited on by a matron with hair cut short to look like a boy, he had him whipped with rods through the three theatres and then banished him. Hylas, a pantomimic actor, was publicly scourged in the atrium of his own house, on complaint of a praetor, and Pylades was expelled from the city and from Italy as well, because by pointing at him with his finger he turned all eyes upon a spectator who was hissing him.

Those social liabilities explain why Roman actors and dancers were legally lumped into the same legal category as pimps, prostitutes, gladiators, convicted adulterers, or males who acted the passive part in homosexual sex — all individuals who operated outside the traditional Roman view of family probity. They were _[infames](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:id=infamia-cn)_ , the word which gives us “infamous” (in Latin, it’s roughly “unspeakables”). An _infamis_ could not hold public office, vote, serve in the military or testify in court. The concept of _infamia_  goes back at least as far as the second century BC, and probably farther; it’s really a routinization of the traditional power of Roman [censors ](https://www.ancient.eu/censor/)to stigmatize “un-Roman” behavior.

The explicit legal connection of _infamia_  and actors goes back much farther than Constantine: it became law in the reign of Augustus, in the _[Lex Julia de maritandis ordinibus](https://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/AugMarriage.html)_ _,_ in 18 BC.

> (_[Epitome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitome)_  13-14) By the terms of the Lex Julia, senators and their descendants are forbidden to marry freedwomen, or women who have themselves followed the profession of the stage, or whose father or mother has done so; other freeborn persons are forbidden to marry a common prostitute, or a procuress, or a woman manumitted by a procurer or procuress, or a woman caught in adultery, or one condemned in a public lawsuit, or one who has followed the profession of the stage....
