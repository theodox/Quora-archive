Many times. Here’s a not exhaustive list:

410: to the Goths
455: to the Vandals
546: to the Ostrogoths
1084: to the Normans
1527: to the Holy Roman Empire*
1870: to Italians (or more precisely, to the House of Savoy)
1944: to the Allies



* Sort of. [It’s complicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(1527)).
