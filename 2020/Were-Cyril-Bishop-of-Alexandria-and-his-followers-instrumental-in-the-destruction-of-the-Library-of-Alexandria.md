No. The Library was long gone and forgotten in Cyril’s day.

The Libray was destroyed in an accidental fire during the war between Julius Caesar and Ptolemy XIII in 47 BC. In fact, even the neighborhood where the Library had once stood was a memory in Cyril’s day — it was destroyed in fighting between Roman emperor Aurelian and queen Zenobia of Palmyra in 273, and much of the ruins were then submerged by a tremendous tsunami in 365 (two years before Cyril was born).

The only way for Cyril to have destroyed the Library would have been time travel; the time gap is about as wide as that which separates us from Christopher Columbus. The last recorded mention of the Library — a note by Aulus Gellius discussing its destruction in Caesar’s day — is about two centuries before Cyril was born.
