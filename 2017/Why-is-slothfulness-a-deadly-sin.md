The sloth started off his life in the academic tradition via the Portugese _Preguiça,_ which is is basically a non-theological word for “laziness.” In Latin it’s _pigritia_ .

Traditionally _pigritia_ is a venial sin — not a virtue, certainly, but a but not one of the big 7; what our Portuguese explorers would know as a _pecadilho_ . The deadly version is a different word: _acedia._ One assumes those Portuguese explorers in Brazil knew enough Aquinas to avoid levelling such a serious accusation at poor old _Bradypus_  when they first met him.

When the name was brought over into English, it got upgraded from the venial laziness to the mortal sloth; that might have just been a lazy translation, or perhaps it was a whiff of Puritanical attitudes about work and the importance of appearing busy.

_Acedia_ is supposed to be much more serious than a mere lack of enthusiasm or willingness to work; it’s more like “giving it all up” or “surrendering to despair”. The idea covers a lot of the same territory as what we’d call clinical depression but there is a traditional distinction between acedia and the blameless, medical condition (usually _melancholia_ ). Melancholia describes the _experience_  of sadness, fatigue, and passivity. Acedia describes deciding not to give a damn, which may look a lot like depression but is really more like nihilism. Which is how it ends up on the Big List.
