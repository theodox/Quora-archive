The _horae_ were just divisions of night or day. The 12 hours of day and the 12 hours of night expanded or contracted as the seasons changed. The proportions remained the same: the third hour of the day was always half-way between sunrise and noon, the 10th was always 2/3 of the way between noon and sunset.

The fact that that the “hour” could vary between about 45 and 75 of our minutes was not very important for most purposes. Where precision was necessary a [clepsydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock) — a water clock — or a candle with a known length would provide repeatable timings regardless of the movement of the sun, but there were few things in the Roman world which required by-the-minute precision: interestingly, one of the first examples was the use of clepsydra to make sure that clients at brothels did not overstay their appointments.

Greeks and Romans were definitely aware of the changing length of the days. The Greek engineer [Ctesibius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesibius) designed a clepsydra with dials that accounted for the changing length of the day as early as the 3rd century BC. There are even a few examples of [portable sundials with precalculated offsets for different cities ](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/early-tech-adopters-ancient-rome-had-portable-sundials-180962225/):

These devices would let you derive a pretty good “absolute hour” — a 24th of a day — from the variable-length hours of daylight. However, very few people needed, or could afford, precise absolute timepieces. The needs of most people could be served by sundials in public places which would only show the varying divisions of the day with some simple markings appropriate to the season.

_A sundial base from Pompei, marked (in Greek). The vertical lines are the hours, the curved horizontal lines are the reference for different months. The topmost line is θέρος,_ summer, _the bottom most is χειμών,_ winter.

Among other examples, emperor Augustus set up a[ giant sundial in the Campus Martius,](http://www.livius.org/articles/place/rome/rome-photos/rome-horologium-augusti/) using an obelisk captured during his war with Cleopatra as the gnomon. Portions of the marking were recently found by an archeologist who reverse-engineered where the hour-lines would have to have been placed.
