In 400 BC they’d be speaking what we’d technically call “Middle Demotic Egyptian” — but it would really be a waypoint on the direct line between the language of the New Kingdom and Coptic. There’s not a hard line of demarcation because the same spoken language was written in the traditional Egyptian casual script, [Demotic ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)#:~:text=Demotic%20(from%20Ancient%20Greek%3A%20%CE%B4%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82,Late%20Egyptian%20and%20preceding%20Coptic), and would in a couple of hundred years be written in a new “Coptic” script derived from Greek with the addition of a few characters from Demotic.

During the Roman era in Egypt up to the Arabic conquest, Egyptians borrowed some words from Greek — and a little bit of Latin and Syriac — but Coptic is fundamentally just the linear evolution of Demotic Egyptian. A modern Coptic speaker would nevertheless still find a Copt from 2400 years ago difficult to understand: even though the modern form of Coptic reflects the way the language ossified about 500 years ago, there is still a millennium and a half of gradual evolution separating a modern Copt from his or her ancestor of 2400 years ago. The gap is not quantifiable but impressionistically, it’s similar to that separates modern Greek from classical Greek.

We know that Egyptians from Upper and Lower Egypt had a hard time understanding each other, the dialectical differences were strong enough to generate jokes but they didn’t show up strongly in writing. That suggests that somebody from a thousand or more years into the future might have a particularly tough time if their time machine dumped them at the wrong end of the Nile.

In 400 BC an educated Egyptian might also be literate in, and verbally familiar with “Late Neo Middle-Egyptian” — which is to say, the language of the Middle Kingdom, which in 400 BC had been effectively a “dead language” for a thousand years. Late Egyptian was at least as different from Middle Egyptian as, say, Italian from Latin; an ordinary person in the street from 400 BC would probably recognize set phrases but couldn’t carry on a conversation in Middle Egyptian.
