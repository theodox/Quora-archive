It depends on how you define "same." 

In historic times, at least, there was a fairly standard canon of deities in every Greek city -- we usually say '12' but [that's a big oversimplifcation](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-estimated-population-of-the-Ancient-Greek-pantheon/answer/Steve-Theodore) -- which were were recognizably the same. 

However, the ancient world was hyper-local; every city had unique traditions, often of great antiquity and so obscure that even the locals didn't really know what they meant, Therefore it was very common for the local version of the familiar Olympians to acquire extra attributes, nicknames, or myths which were unique. Different cities placed greater or lesser emphasis on different gods, though the general attitude was that it was always wiser to err on the side of inclusiveness (in the New Testament, Paul points out the existence of an altar at Athens specifically to "the unknown God" -- ie, a catch-all for anybody who might feel offended at being left out of the city's regular devotions).

The ancient world was one of bewildering cultural complexity, since information travelled so much more slowly than it does today; every remote valley was practically a unique culture. In order to cope with the barriers of culture and language the Greeks made a big point of assimilating foreign deities into their pantheon: thus Marduk, the king of the Babylonian pantheon, is just "Zeus" when the Greeks talk about him; Melqart, the Phoenician hero, became Hercules; in Ephesus the virginal Artemis somehow assimilated a pre-Greek fertility goddess; and so on. 

All of which meant that two Greeks from different cities could happily agree that they both worshipped 'Zeus' with fairly little actual common ground beyond that -- while they could also visit a foreign temple from a completely alien tradition without feeling too out of place. The most famous example is probably Alexander the Great's [proclamation of himself as son of Zeus](https://www.quora.com/To-which-religion-did-Alexander-the-Great-belong/answer/Steve-Theodore) at the temple of Amun in Siwa, Egypt (rather than, say, at Olympia or Delphi). The core of common beliefs was primarily literary: the poets like Homer and Hesiod were known everywhere Greek was spoken so their stories were universal. Many details of religious practice and tradition, however, were unique to different locales.
