[Code Review Stack Exchange](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/) is a good place if you have working code and would like it to be commented on by others. It's not as macho as regular StackExchange : it's a site for style and organization questions instead of the regular "how do I do X" questions on regular StackExchange.
