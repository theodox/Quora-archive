# Can anyone list the members of the Greek pantheon and their Roman equivalents? I've tried looking on Google but can only, at most, find the 12 Olympians.

An accurate accounting of all the various Greco-Roman deities is going to be impossible, for reasons spelled out at greater length [in this question](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-estimated-population-of-the-Ancient-Greek-pantheon).

All that said, here’s a fairly long list in two columns: [Encyclopedia Mythica: Roman vs Greek](http://www.pantheon.org/miscellaneous/roman_vs_greek.html) .

However, these pairings are often much less exact (and much less like two names for the same thing) than they seem. The “Greco-Roman” pantheon was a product of politics and literary tastes, not of a shared religious tradition. It suited the educated elites of both cultures to pretend that their respective traditions were much closer than you or I might think if we witnessed them first hand. Over time the two traditions did more or less fuse — though, in a way characteristic of ancient Paganism, they never really achieved a stable body of doctrine or lore. That was a long, spotty process however and before it was complete other religious trends — the cults of Isis and Cybele, Mithraism, Judaism and Christianity to name a few — played increasingly large roles in belief in both the Greek and Latin speaking parts of the empire.

The [process by which Greeks and Romans decided how their respective traditions should be lined up ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretatio_graeca)was very complex and in no way systematic: different observers could decided that their own god X was somebody else’s god Y based on any number of criteria.

Area of responsibility seems like a natural fit. So: Zeus, king of the Gods and master of the heavens must be the same as Jupiter. That’s actually a pretty good matchup (the names are actually distantly related, [both going back to an Indo-European root word meaning “bright” or “shining”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_religion#Sky_Father)). But not all matchups work so neatly. Ares the war god, one assumes, must be Mars. However the old Italian Mars was a serious, sober fellow: he was the god of the Roman citizen soldier who divided his time between fighting and farming, so his rituals and responsibilities involved agriculture as well as war. Ares, by contrast, is basically a psychopath: his name means “ruin” and he’s the patron of bloodlust and nihilistic violence and he also seduces the wife of another god. Yes, they both cover warfare — but in _very_  different ways.

Another way the matchups can be difficult is when there’s more than one fit. There seem to have been three different gods of the underworld in the old Italian tradition. [Dīs Pater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C4%ABs_Pater) was a god of death but also of renewal and the cycle of life. [Orcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orcus) on the other hand handled punishments in the afterlife, a role with no single Greek equivalent. The familiar [Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto_(mythology)) is a kind of wildcard: Greeks would refer to Hades as _to plouton_ , “the wealthy one”_,_ to avoid naming him directly. Greek mystery cults like the [Eleusinian Mysteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries) made a distinction between Hades — who Homer called “hated by all mortals” — and a benevolent god of the afterlife also called Plouton. So, when Latin speakers adopted Plouton as Pluto, they could be thinking of their own Dis Pater; of the original Hades, or of the Eleusinian Plouton. Or of _Ploutos_ , a different Greek god of underground mineral wealth.

Sometimes the Greco-Roman matchup could effectively erase an existing god. [Liber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber#Liber.2C_Bacchus_and_Dionysus) and [Libera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libera_(mythology)) were the Italian god and goddess of wine, fertility, and freedom (the root of “liberty” is also the word for drunkenness and fornication, as many college kids can tell you). However as were assimilated to the Greek [Dionysus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus) (usually Latinized as Bacchus) they lost their connection to politics and fertility. Libera was matched up with the Greek [Persephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone) (daughter of [Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter) and goddess of annual renewal), but the Roman government deliberately encourage the Greek version with it’s apolitical atmosphere over the native one, which which was connected to the a political challenge to the Patricians. Interestingly though the Greek cult of Bacchus was regarded with suspicion and was even [suppressed for a time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senatus_consultum_de_Bacchanalibus).

Lastly there is the very large category of gods with no matchup at all. Rome had several distinctive religious traditions with no easily found Greek equivalents — some of the most famous are [Janus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus) the two-headed god of doors and transitions; [Terminus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminus_(god)) the god of boundaries and borders; and [Quirinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirinus), the god who protected the Roman citizen body.
