The Latin verb would be [illuminare](http://latindictionary.wikidot.com/verb:illuminare). Telling one person would to light it up would be _hoc illumina_ and telling lots of people would be _hoc illuminate._ You could probably drop the ‘hoc’ since the form of _illuminare_  tells a hearer that it is a direct action and Latin allows you to drop an implied object in this kind of case.

However if you want something punchier you could use _fiat lux_ , “Let there be light,” — although in that case you’re competing with the motto of several dozens of colleges and universities all over the world

__edit @Alberto Yagos’__ suggestion of _accendere_ would be better if the idea is ‘to light it on fire’ , like a torch or a the fireplace
