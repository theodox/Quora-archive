This is a nice scanned version from 1552 which I think once belonged to John Adams:

[Ton Dionos tou Kassiou Romaikon historion biblia pente kai eikosi = Dionis Cassii Romanarum historiarum libri XXV : Cassius Dio Cocceianus](https://archive.org/details/tondionostoukass00cass)

Here’s a competing edition from [Les Bibliotheques Virtuelles Humanistes](http://www.bvh.univ-tours.fr/Consult/consult.asp?numtable=B372615206_7587&numfiche=485&mode=3&ecran=0&offset=4), published in Paris in 1551 covering the epitome of [John Xiphilinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Xiphilinus) which starts with Dio’s book 36 (Pompey).

I doubt these are the only ones, bilingual Greek-Latin editions were as common before the 19th century as bilingual Greek-English or Latin-English ones are today.
