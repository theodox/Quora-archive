It's not exactly "no fun" -- if it's no fun when you ship it, you should have either killed the project or moved on to another job.

However, as [Ernest W. Adams](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ernest-W-Adams) points out, your experiences of the game is extremely different from that of an ordinary player. You can never forget the game you wanted to make -- which is _never_  the game you ended up making in the real world where time, technology and money constrain what you can accomplish. Where another player sees a cool view or an interesting mechnanic, you see see remember how good it looked before lots of textures and polygons had to be stripped out for performance reasons, and you can't help but see all the little shortcuts and compromises that make the real, finished product less glorious and less all-encompassing than the fantasy product you set out to make. And, of course, you don't ever get the experience of discovery that a regular player would: you learn the game slowly, in fits and starts with many revisions and backtrackings, over several years, where the usual player experiences it in few dozen hours without all the crises, changes of direction, and lost opportunities that every dev has to live with.

On the other hand, you also get to experience a lot of nostalgia while you play. Development is stressful. It might be disrespectful to say it's "like combat", but like combat it really binds a team together in ways that few other experiences can. You will know the secret story behind that puzzling piece of grafitti, or the outrageous hacks needed to pull off that cool effect, or what your cube-mate looked like when he woke of from a catnap at his keyboard with keycap impressions all over his face the night before the E3 build dropped. 

So, what we see and what you see are very different, but both have their virtues.
