The last Roman-Sassanid war was a crazy seesaw, with each side scoring major wins and suffering crushing defeats. The Persians captured Egypt (621) and beseiged Constantinople (626), both times with Shahrbaraz in command.

After the failure of the attack on Constantinople, however, Shahrbaraz fell out of favor with his emperor. [Khosrow II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosrow_II) sent a letter to Shahrbaraz’s second-in-command, [Kardarigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardarigan_(7th_century)), telling him to kill Shahrbaraz and take control of the army. However the message was intercepted by the Byzantines and shown to Shahrbaraz. He, not surprisingly, decided he had no future in the Persian service. He took his army out of the war and began to spin a conspiracy with other disaffected Persian nobles to dethrone Khosrow.

In 627 — after Heraclius defeated Khosrow’s forces at [Nineveh ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nineveh_(627))— the conspiracy placed the Khosrow’s son on the throne as [Kavad II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavad_II). After Khosrow was killed, a civil war ensued: not only was the empire tired of the Byzantine war, the conflict also reawakened tensions between the Parthian and Persian nobilities. The result was a weakened empire that had to come to terms with the Byzantines, returning all of the territory captured in the past decade and paying a heavy tribute.

After Kavad died (630) Shahrbaraz took the throne for himself, with Heraclius’ backing. However Shahrbaraz was assassinated at his own coronation. It’s interesting to speculate how the events of the next half-century would have played out differently if he had survived. [Yazdegerd III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazdegerd_III) — only twelve years old — was theoretically a Roman ally at the time of the decisive battle of [Yarmouk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Yarmouk) in 636, but he was just a child. If the forceful and competent Shahrbaraz had been emperor instead, things events might have played out differently.

All of this side-switching seems strange to us, but it was common in this era. Khosrow himself had been placed on the throne with the backing of Roman emperor [Maurice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_(emperor)). Maurice himself was deposed by the rebellion of [Phocas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocas) — Khosrow’s pretext for attacking the Romans in 602 was to avenge the death of his ally. The Roman emperor [Heraclius, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclius)who convinced Shahrbaraz to abandon Khosrow, had himself overthrown Phocas.
