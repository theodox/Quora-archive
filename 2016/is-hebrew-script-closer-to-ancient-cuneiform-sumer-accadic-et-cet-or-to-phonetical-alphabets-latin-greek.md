Hebrew is derived from Phoenician characters, which in turn derive ultimately from [Ugaritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugaritic_alphabet).

Hebrew gets its letter forms from [Phoenician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet) and thence [Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_alphabet), but the switch to “letters” from the complex mixture of syllabic and ideographic rules that marked cuneiform goes back to Ugaritic which dumped all of the complexity in favor of a 30-character alphabet (written, like Hebrew, without vowels)

Phoenician, starting around 1050 BCE
