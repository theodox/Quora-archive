It's a bit tough to come up with a good modern analogy that doesn't sound too sinister. Saddam's Republican Guard, perhaps? The NKVD? The Praetorians were not quite as scary as the Waffen-SS, but they played the same basic role: the were the personal army of the ruler, rather than the army of the state. And, like such units throughout history, they were a hotbed of political repression and intrigue.

The name _praetorian_  dates back to the Republican period, where it was used to refer to the troops who provided the immediate protection for the commanding general who was usually a [praetor](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/praetor/) (although the consuls were the supreme military commanders, a praetor or pro-praetor had the rank to command an independent force in the field). The _cohors praetoria_  in Republican armies usually 'picked men', regarded as reliable and paid more than ordinary troopers, but they weren't trained or equipped any differently than other legionaries as far was we know. They were essentially similar to the 'household troops' which accompanied later kings onto the battlefield.

However when people talk about the Praetorian Guard, they usually mean the private army of the Caesars, which was permanently stationed at Rome and which functioned primarily as a political security force. In the early Republican period Rome was extremely cautious about allowing military power to reside in the city: even a victorious army returning from a foreign war was required to wait outside the city before celebrating its triumph, and was disbanded immediately: the soldiers had to hand in their weapons and reverted to citizens the next day. But, after the Republic tore itself apart in the civil wars of the first century BC it was obvious that the era of civilian control of the military was over. When [Octavian](http://www.roman-empire.net/emperors/augustus.html) solidified his position as the de-facto ruler of Rome, he was too canny to trust his own safety and the fragile peace of the new empire entirely to majesty of the law and the goodwill of the Senate.

So Octavian -- now renamed [Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus), but still ultimately a victorious warlord -- maintained a permanent force in and around Rome to make sure than nobody else would attempt what he himself and his adoptive father, Julius Caesar had both done and march on the capital.* Augustus general policy was to maintain a veneer of Republican respectability, so he stationed the troops in small detachments -- only three 1,000-man cohorts were within the city itself, and six more dispersed in central Italy where they were easily accessible, but less obviously oppressive. Since Augustus had the _imperium maius_  -- effectively, permanent supreme command of the Roman military -- calling his private army a 'praetorian cohort' preserved a figleaf of continuity wth tradition. Every general, after all , has his praetorians.

The figleaf, however, was not much of a disguise. Augustus was genuinely popular -- ending a century of vicious civil wars has a way of excusing your other faults -- and he didn't need to rely very much on the Praetorians for either protection or coercion. However his successor, [Tiberius,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius) didn't have Augustus' popularity or his foresight. He leaned very heavily on [Sejanus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejanus) the commander of the Praetorians, who quickly transformed a loyalist military force into a secret police -- adept at sniffing out (or, equally often, imagining) plots against the emperor. And, as such, they were always deeply implicated in the murderous maneuverings of the imperial court.

_This coin of Claudius tells the story of his accession: the reverse reads IMPER[IUM] RECEPT[UM] -- "power received" and depicts the Praetorian camp. According to gossip, Claudius was found hiding behind a curtain in the palace when Caligula was assassinated and obliged to accept the throne by Praetorians -- who promptly demanded a healthy payoff._ 

So, between Tiberius and Diocletian the Praetorians, were quite literally, the kingmakers of Roman politics. It was acclamation by the Praetorians, rather than decrees of the Senate or the force of law which usually determined the imperial succession. The first act of any new emperor's reign was always to grant the Praetorians a [donativum,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donativum) a cash payment -- either in recompense for their support or to secure their loyalty. Inevitably the Praetorians began to regard this as a right, rather than a gift: the short lived [Pertinax ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertinax)was murdered by the guards when his payments were deemed insufficient in 193; they then turned around and_auctioned off the empire_ (for a price of 25,000 sesterces per man**) to [Didius Julianus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didius_Julianus) Perhaps it's not surprising that [Septimius Severus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus)-- the Syrian general who overthrew Didius -- gave his sons this advice on his deathbed _"Be harmonious, enrich the soldiers, and scorn all other men"***_ Although the nominal function of the Praetorians was to protect the emperor, in practice they were more dangerous to the throne than any outside force: between 17 and 312, Praetorians were implicated in the murders of at least 13 emperors.

_Coin of Caligula, addressing the troops.... who are probably Praetorians, since Caligula never led armies in battle. The Praetorians are said to have murdered Tiberius in his sleep, paving the way for Caligula's accession in 37. His first official acts included a big bonus for the Praetorians - setting a pattern that would bedevil the empire for another three centuries._ 

Like many primarily political military units, the Praetorians enjoyed good funding and an 'elite' reputation, but they were usually not a prominent feature on imperial battlefields. It's notable that, for example, the same Praetorians who auctioned off the empire to Didius mounted no military opposition to Severus when he descended on Rome with actual battlefield troops. When the praetorians [forced emperor Nerva to adopt the powerful general Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casperius_Aelianus) as his colleague, the new co-emperor casually executed the leaders of the putsch that brought him to the throne because he was secure in the backing of the frontier legions. In the [bad days of the third century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century), when rival military commanders fought openly for control of the empire, barracks intrigue counted for less; the Praetorians of a given emperor were more likely to be his proven battlefield companions (and thus, "real" soldiers) rather than pampered paramilitaries -- but, unfortunately, they quickly inherited the former's penchant for assassinations and political intrigue.

_This coin of Trajan Decius celebrates the liberalitas augusti -- the "generosity" of the emperor_  

The Praetorians faded from the scene after the civil wars of the third century, as Rome finally abandoned all pretense of continuity with the Republican past. Diocletian reduced their establishment, and -- since he never resided in Rome -- took away the real key to their power. Constantine eventually disbanded them for good when they sided with his rival, Maxentius. 

In the later empire, the praetorians' security role was assigned to different household troops over time: the [Ioviani and Herculiani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jovians_and_Herculians), the [Domestic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticus_(Roman_Empire))i, the [Scholae Palatinae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholae_Palatinae), and eventually the [Varangian Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varangian_Guard). However the secret police functions tended to center on a new, less clearly defined group known as [agentes in rebus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentes_in_rebus) -- nominally agents of the imperial treasury, but essentially an intelligence service.



_* It's worth pointing out that when Caesar crossed the Rubicon with only a single legion, there was essentially no military force in Rome to oppose him: Pompey and the loyalist Senators had to flee and raise troops in the provinces._ 

_** It's extremely hard to come up with a modern monetary figure for this amount._ _[This article](http://thecampvs.com/2006/03/21/the-relative-value-of-ancient-coinage/)_ _would suggest that's about $32,000 but in purchasing-power-parity terms based on wheat a sestertius would be about $0.75 so the total would be more like $18,750. It sounds like a bargain -- but that investment only bought Didius the empire for nine weeks before his defeat and execution by Septimius Severus._ 

_*** They didn't listen: Caracalla, backed by the Praetorians, murdered his brother Geta within months of Septimius death._
