it wasn’t exactly ‘created;’ it’s more accurate to say that it was adapted.

The Greek alphabet is ultimately just a modified version of the Phoenician alphabet, which came to Greece thanks to Phoenician traders in the late ninth or early 8th century BC.

This graphic illustrates the relationship quite nicely; you can see that most Greek letters are copies — sometimes flipped or rotated — of Phoenician characters.*

The Greeks themselves were aware of this connection though — in typical Greek fashion — a slow, erratic ad-hoc improvisation was attributed to a single individual’s actions. Here’s [Herodotus’s version of the story:](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/5c*.html)

> These Phoenicians who came with Cadmus… at their settlement in this country, among many other kinds of learning, brought into Hellas the alphabet, which had hitherto been unknown, as I think, to the Greeks; and presently as time went on the sound and the form of the letters were changed. At this time the Greeks that dwelt round them for the most part were [Ionians](https://www.livius.org/articles/people/yauna/); who, having been taught the letters by the Phoenicians, used them with some few changes of form, and in so doing gave to these characters (as indeed was but just, seeing that the Phoenicians had brought them into Hellas) the name of Phoenician.​[4](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/5C*.html#note4) Thus also the Ionians have from ancient times called papyrus-sheepskins, because formerly for lack of papyrus they used the skins of sheep and goats; and even to this day there are many [foreigners](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/barbarians/) who write on such skins.

> I have myself seen Cadmean characters in the temple of Ismenian Apollo at [Thebes of Boeotia](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/thebes-greece/), graven on certain tripods and for the most part like Ionian letters.

Later on, by the early years of the Roman Empire, some writers ascribed the creation of the alphabet in whole or in part to [Palamedes](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Palamedes-Greek-legend), nominally a hero from the era of the Trojan War. Here’s[ the Roman writer Pliny’s version,](https://www.attalus.org/translate/pliny_hn7c.html#192) writing in the first century of our era (and about five centuries after Herodotus):

> I am of opinion that the [Assyrians](https://www.attalus.org/translate/rd.htm#Assyria) have always had writing, but others, for instance [Gellius,](https://www.attalus.org/translate/rd.htm#Gnaeus_Gellius) hold that it was invented in Egypt by [Mercury,](https://www.attalus.org/translate/rd.htm#Mercury_(mythology)) while others think it was discovered in Syria; both schools of thought believe that [Cadmus](https://www.attalus.org/translate/rd.htm#Cadmus) imported an alphabet of 16 letters into Greece from [Phoenicia](https://www.attalus.org/translate/rd.htm#Phoenicia) and that to these [Palamedes](https://www.attalus.org/translate/rd.htm#Palamedes_(mythology)) at the time of the [Trojan War](https://www.attalus.org/translate/rd.htm#Trojan_War) added the four characters ΖΨΦΧ, and after him Simonides the lyric poet added another four ΥΞΩΘ, all representing sounds recognised also in the Roman alphabet. [Aristotle](https://www.attalus.org/translate/rd.htm#Aristotle) holds that the primitive alphabet contained 18 letters, and that Ψ and Ζ were added by [Epicharmus](https://www.attalus.org/translate/rd.htm#Epicharmus_of_Kos) more probably than [Palamedes.](https://www.attalus.org/translate/rd.htm#Palamedes_(mythology))

This version is unlikely to be correct on the details — if Palamedes really existed and really was an Achaean warrior at Troy he’d be about four hundred years older than the oldest examples of alphabetic Greek. The Bronze Age Greeks of the twelfth century BC did have a writing system, but it was not alphabetic and it went extinct during the [Bronze Age collapse. ](https://www.worldhistory.org/Bronze_Age_Collapse/)Here is [a roundup of the variant versions](https://crewsproject.wordpress.com/2017/05/22/writing-gods-and-myths-i/) of Palamedes and other late candidates for “inventor of writing” in Greek tradition.

Nonetheless Palamedes story and is based on a solid observation: the mature Greek alphabet added signs which didn’t exist in Phoenician. However it misses the most important point: the Phoenician alphabet is strictly speaking an [abjad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#Abjads_and_the_structure_of_Semitic_languages) — a script that encodes only consonants, rather than consonants and vowels. In Semitic languages like Arabic and Hebrew this helps emphasize the way that most words are derived from consonantal roots with different vowels providing grammatical information that is relatively easy for a reader to infer. Greek is a much more vowel-heavy language, so the Greeks adapted some symbols from Phoenician to write vowel sounds, creating the first true “alphabet”. The Greek Α,Ε,Ι,Ο and Η (the last being a long “e” sound) were repurposed from Phoenician consonants into vowels; the Greeks also added two new symbols Υ and Ω for “u” and long “o”). This change expanded the appeal of alphabetic writing compared to other systems and became the basis of many modern scripts including our own.

One other thing worth mentioning is the fact that the mature form of the Greek alphabet really owes a lot to Athens. Right after the end of the Peloponnesian war the Athenian government formally adopted the Ionic letter forms in place of its own local variant. This turned out to be a historic change for Greek overall, because Philip of Macedon and his son Alexander recruited primarily Athenians to staff their bureaucracies. When Alexander suddenly became master of a vast empire, it was administered using the Ionic-Attic alphabet, which quickly eclipsed its many local competitors. [This new alphabet and the simplified, genericized speech forms that emerged in its wake became the Koine or “common” speech of the Greek world](https://www.quora.com/Who-created-the-Koine-Greek-Writing-Why-was-it-written-more-like-Hieroglyphics-and-Demotic-than-its-mainland-Greece-dialectic-writing-Why-were-most-ancient-mainland-Greeks-not-able-to-read-Koine/answer/Steve-Theodore), the language of the eastern Roman empire and the early church.



* Not everywhere in the Greek world adapted the characters the same way — the Greek cities in Italy adapted their Phoenician characters with a few different flips and sometimes different repurposing of the originals. This is why the modern Latin alphabet has a few important differences from the modern Greek one: they are based on different branches of the ancient Greek experiments. The Wiki article does a good job on the regional differences.
