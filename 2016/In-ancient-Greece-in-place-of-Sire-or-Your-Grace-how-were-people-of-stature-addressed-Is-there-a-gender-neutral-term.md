# In ancient Greece, in place of "Sire" or "Your Grace," how were people of stature addressed? Is there a gender neutral term?

There really isn't a good analog. Most of the titles of nobility we're used to -- the 'your grace' or 'your highness' kinds of stuff -- seem to be products of the later Empire (and, originally, of Latin: even fairly late you'll see Byzantine Greek titles like νωβελίσσιμος, _nobilissimus,_ "most noble" which are clearly of Latin origin.) 

Early Greek, by contrast, didn't have a vocabulary appropriate to finely gradated social distinctions: there was no Greek equivalent for the different 'ranks' of nobility we recognize in feudal Europe. Even actual kings were fairly rare before Alexander's day; and the nobility, such as it was, tended to be lumped together into vague abstractions: the _oligoi,_ "the few", the _aristoi,_ "the best people", the _kaloi k'agathoi ,_ "the good and beautiful" (they weren't feudal but that didn't make them modest!).

Accordingly, they also didn't make much use of formal titles when speaking to each other. Even a pro-Macedonian politician like [Isocrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isocrates) could start of a (pretty fawning) address to Philip of Macedon with nothing fancier than ὦ Φίλιππε, "O Phillip".

In classical Greek the closest thing to a generic term for a superior would be kύριος, which could mean something between "person in authority" and "lord." In earlier usage --which leans very heavily on democratic Athens -- the former meaning is more common; through the Hellenistic period the second one gains ground. Κύριος is usually how the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint) and the New Testament refer to God; most Christian services still use it in Greek as the[ Kyrie Eleison. ](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08714a.htm)Like everything else in Greek it has grammatical gender so a female authority figure (not, it should be pointed out, an easy concept for the Greeks) would be κυρια, _kyria._ In modern Greek it is a generic 'mister' or 'ms.' but there really wasn't an ancient analog for our habit of adding a rank-marker to people's names in classical time. 

In some times and places you might use [δεσπότης, ](#)_despotes,_ "master." However that's the word you would use for a slave-owner: not something a free person would say to another lightly. The feminine would be _despoina._ __ 

When classical-era Greeks addressed one another directly they often began with an "O!" (actually ὦ_)._  I suspect it filled something of the social role later European titles: the intonation and emphasis in that "O!' probably held a lot of social status information. 

An important vehicle for offering status -- or groveling -- in Greek is the use of _epithets:_ the sort of adjectives applied so often in Homer: "shining Achilles", "great-hearted Achilles", "loud-thundering Zeus" and so on. In formal contexts -- like an embassy or a court panegyric -- you could lay on adjectives to smooth things out. That habit wasn't common in classical times but picked up steam after Alexander's era. You would not ordinarily do this in regular conversation however: it was a part of public oratory.
