In many ways, your instinct is correct: on a legal and political and ideological level this particular division was no more complete or invidious than any of the [dozens of similar arrangments](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-causes-of-the-split-of-the-Roman-Empire-into-Western-and-Eastern) dating back even before Diocletian; indeed, since it was a planned arrangement from the start it was less messy and contentious than many previous divisions which more practically resembled cease-fire agreements between rival generalissimos than the majestic process of the law.

_If you want to see a really dysfunctional division of the empire, consider the checkered career of_ _[Licinius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licinius)_ _, who at various times between 308 and 324 fought both with _and_ against Maximinus, Constantine, and_ _[Valerius Valens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerius_Valens)_ _. (He's also the only person to be an Augustus of the West and of the East at different times)._ 

The main reason that Theodosius' division of the empire was so fateful is the series of disasters which unfolded in the west during the reign of Honorius. Institutionally it differed little from the previous divisions. However this time the division would end up more like an amputation. Had the Western empire lasted another century the “division” of the empire by Theodosius would be just another footnote. As it happened, though, Theodosius handed his two incompetent sons a terrible scenario: increasing barbarian pressure, collapsing finances (especially in the west), an apathetic civilian population and a political system rife with intrigue. They did not rise to the challenge.

Neither of Theodosius' sons had any particular talent as rulers. Arcadius was a non-entity whose court was a model of corruption and intrigue: a pattern that would become wearily familiar in later Byzantine times. Honorius was petulant and suspicious, his only notable achievement being a natural death -- something of surprise given the times. Honorius' fecklessness and paranoia were proximately responsible for the sack of Rome: not only did he murder his ablest general, [Stilicho,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho) while the Visigoths were massed in the Alps — he also connived in a pogrom against the families of the Germanic auxiliaries who formed a large part of the peninsula's defenses. Not surprisingly many of the survivors fought for, rather than against Alaric and the Goths shortly thereafter. Honorius also did nothing notable to save the city during the two-year long Gothic investment of the city. Perhaps more significant for the long run than the Gothic invasion was the [crossing of the Rhine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_of_the_Rhine) in 406, which permanently undermined Roman sovereignty in Gaul and began the wholesale settlement of intact barbarian tribes within Roman borders.

With all of that dire and dreary background (and few other indignities, like hiring the same Visigoths who sacked Rome to fight another of his own rebellious commanders) it's no surprise that Honorius' reign seems particularly fateful. But that isn’t really due to this particular division: it’s a combination of the gradual decline of the West, increasing external pressure, and the confluence of two incompetent rulers at the same time.

Theodosius' died only 4 months into his reign as 'sole emperor.' This meant that both halves of the empire ended up under weak rulers at the same time — and they were 10 years old in the west and 18 in the east, to boot. Court intrigue and palace politics occupied more of the two courts' attention than administration or defense. This factionalism meant that cooperation between the two realm was strained and half-hearted at best. The reigns of Honorius and Arcadius saw the revolt of [Gildo ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gildo)in Africa, who seems to have plotted to exchange his Western master for a more distant Eastern one. They also saw the Eastern court ordering Stilicho and his army not to fight the Goths who had invaded the Balkans: evidently Constantinople was more worried about the Western troops than the Goths who were plundering Greece and Macedonia. It's also possible that Stilicho conspired in the death of Rufinus, his opposite number at Arcadius' court — and/or that Rufinus had invited the Goths in for his own reasons. This kind of backstabbing and disunity was already a regular feature of Late-Roman life well before Theodosius but in the 5th century it would prove to be a luxury the Empire could no longer afford.

_Theodosius and sons_ 

One way in which the succession and division was somewhat unusual was that it was a rare case of hereditary imperial succession (and succession by children who lived to adulthood). The Roman Empire was [never formally a hereditary monarchy](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires) — a situation which produced more than a little tragedy but did tend to ensure that only the most able and ruthless wore the purple for long. Theodosius himself was no mean infighter, but he failed to pass on his ability to his children. On the other hand it's worth pointing out that the Theodosian dynasty would hang on for another two generations on both sides of the Adriatic: [Valentinian III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentinian_III) -- who gave Honorius serious competition for the title of 'Worst Roman Emperor' was the last Theodosian in the West in 455 ; [Marcian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcian)in the east in 457 . As you can see, the family remained in power on both sides of the Adriatic - and Valentinian in the West was a grandson of Arcadius, not Honorius. The Theodosians clearly saw it as a single entity even if they managed it poorly, like a big family doing a bad job of keeping up grandpas summer house.

So, to sum up: the division was merely another in a long series of similar events. It looks more significant than the others only because it coincided with the rapid dissolution of the West. Marcian at least managed to salvage the fate of the East, by effectively abandoning the West completely. Valentinian on the other hand presided over another sack of Rome, having (like his grand-uncle Honorius) [murdered his best general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavius_Aetius) on the eve of a barbarian invasion. The family blood ran true in that regard, at least.
