# After the Roman conquest of Egypt, the Egyptians started to venerate the reigning Roman emperor as pharaoh. What did the emperors think about that practice? Did any emperor officially adopt the title of Pharaoh?

They used that title with their Egyptian-speaking subjects, but they didn’t adopt it in other languages.

In Latin it took a long time for the imperial office to really acquire a stable title at all: “Caesar” provided[ a handy euphemism that at first helped to avoid questions about whether Rome was really a monarchy.](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Caesar-come-to-mean-emperor-Why-did-all-Roman-emperors-call-themselves-Caesar-of-Rome/answer/Steve-Theodore) “Imperator” described the emperor’s military authority, “Augustus” eventually came to represent his more-than-human dimensions. It was very common to accumulate victory titles: defeat the Germans, add “Germanicus” to your names; defeat the Parthians in a big way, become a “Parthicus Maximus,” and so on. But the Romans did not share the later European habit of accumulating a laundry-list of territorial titles.*

In Egypt, the emperor had two very different sets of subjects.

For his Greek-speaking subjects he was, essentially, a Hellenistic king. Ptolemaic rulers had always been kings (βασιλεύς) and queens (βασίλισσα) to their Greek subjects, but the early emperors were careful not to position themselves as heirs of the Ptolemies. For a while, Greek Egypt borrowed the Latin euphemisms: Αυτοκρατορ (“imperator”), Καισαρ (“Caesar”) and _Σεβαστος (“Augustus”)_ were the preferred Greek titles in earlier Roman Egypt. After the third century, however, the Greco-Egyptian bureaucracy stopped pretending and starting using βασιλεύς.

In Egyptian, however, the line between bureaucratese and sacred text was hard to find: the intense formal conservatism of Egyptian religious art militated against a faithful translation of the subtle politics embedded in the difference between “Caesar” and “king.” Even during Augustus’ own lifetime — when no Roman would dare say the word “king” out loud — Egyptian art had already slotted the new conqueror seamlessly into the tradition of the pharoahs in both artistic and literary terms. Here’s Augustus as he appears on the temple of Dendur, built around 15 years into his reign:

In this image Augustus is identified by name in the two cartouches at top right, which are hieroglyphics transliterations of Αυτοκρατορ Καισαρος, Imperator Caesar. The cartouches already tell an Egyptian reader that we are talking about a pharaoh (they are symbolic versions of a royal seal ring). But elsewhere in the same temple you can see the Egyptian artists have cut to the chase:

If you compare the two sets of cartouches you’ll notice that the name inside is different:

The cartouches on the left simply say [”pharaoh” (pr-ˤ3), represented by the traditional glyphs 𓉼 for “great” and 𓉐 for “house”](https://www.quora.com/Was-pharaoh-used-by-any-other-ancient-people-besides-the-Greeks-Did-the-ancient-Egyptians-used-this-word-for-their-kings/answer/Steve-Theodore).

This duality continued as long as Roman emperors continued to sponsor hieroglyphic inscriptions: sometimes the imperial name appears in a cartouche but sometimes it’s just “pharaoh.” In Coptic, it’s common to call a Roman emperor [ⲣⲣⲟ (roughly “erro”) or ⲟⲩⲣⲟ (“ouro”),](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E2%B2%A3%E2%B2%A3%E2%B2%9F#Coptic) both descendants of “pharaoh.”**



*Even Justinian, the wordiest of Roman Emperors, would have trembled before Franz Josef II, _Seine Kaiserliche und Königliche Apostolische Majestät von Gottes Gnaden Kaiser von Österreich, König von Ungarn und Böhmen, von Dalmatien, Kroatien, Slawonien, Galizien, Lodomerien und Illyrien; König von Jerusalem, Erzherzog von Österreich; Großherzog von Toskana und Krakau; Herzog von Lothringen, von Salzburg, Steyer, Kärnten, Krain und der Bukowina; Großfürst von Siebenbürgen, Markgraf von Mähren; Herzog von Ober- und Niederschlesien, von Modena, Parma, Piacenza und Guastalla, von Auschwitz und Zator, von Teschen, Friaul, Ragusa und Zara; Gefürsteter Graf von Habsburg und Tirol, von Kyburg, Görz und Gradisca; Fürst von Trient und Brixen; Markgraf von Ober- und Niederlausitz und in Istrien; Graf von Hohenems, Feldkirch, Bregenz, Sonnenberg etc.; Herr von Triest, von Cattaro und auf der Windischen Mark; Großwojwode der Woiwodschaft Serbien etc., etc_ 

_**_ So, for example, a martyr: ⲙⲡⲉϥⲑⲩⲥⲓⲁⲍⲉ ⲛⲛⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉ ⲙⲡ__ⲣⲣⲟ__  ·_he would not worship the gods_ ___of the Emperor___ _._ Coptic speakers heard the “P” sound in “pharaoh” as their version of “the” — and dropped it, turning the word into “rro” or “erro” or “ouro” depending on dialect. Coptic also has ⲫⲁⲣⲁⲱ, which is the Coptic clone of the Greek φαραώ — but it almost always is reserved for Pharoahs in the Bible.
