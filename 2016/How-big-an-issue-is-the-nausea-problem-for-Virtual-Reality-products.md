It's a big deal, because the core of the solution is likely going to be fairly expensive. And if you don’t solve it, a lot of people are only going to experience VR in very negative ways.

We’re essentially trying to hack several of the most highly tuned parts of the human nervous system. We’re not just fooling the eyes with pretty graphics.; we’ve also got to make sure to spoof our inner ears and all of the other systems in our brains which allow us to calibrate our movements in the real world without falling over or breaking things. Simulator sickness basically happens when visual, auditory, inertial and haptic feedback don’t agree: our brains expect them to reflect the same reality and ‘nausea’ is what we call it when our brains are yelling ‘Hey! I can’t make sense of this! Stop!.’

There may be a few clever solutions, like infamous [Virtual Nose](http://www.wired.com/2015/04/reduce-vr-sickness-just-add-virtual-nose/). It might be [possible to spoof signals from your inner ears.](http://www.engadget.com/2016/03/31/mayo-clinic-vr-sickness/) But the big drivers of sickness are framerate and latency, which means that core of the problem is just performance. We need the VR hardware to be so beefy that it can keep up with out beautifully tuned, highly evolved nervous systems. That basically means faster hardware and software, which are both pretty expensive propositions in the near term, with the additional constraint that there’s a functional upper limit for how big and beefy a headset people will wear.

To top it all off, VR sickness tends to be more prevalent in women. That will make it harder for it to be really mass medium — and thus harder to justify big investments in performance.

It will get better, of course — just not right away. Over time each generation of hardware will push more frames and make the experience accessible to more people. I think, though, it’s going to be a long while (in computer time, anyway) before it’s really a mass medium.
