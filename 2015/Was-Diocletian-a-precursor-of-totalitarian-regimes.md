There's two ways to read _totalitarian._ 

Used loosely, it's just a synonym for _intrusive:_ A powerful state which tries to micromanage the affairs of society for its own ends. In that sense most ancient regimes were totalitarian, since the modern theory of rights (really a product of the 17th century, or more exactly a 17th century codification of a medieval ideas) did not exist: Athens and Sparta, the Roman republic, the Principate, and the soldier-emperors all reserved the right to tell people exactly how to live their lives. Long before Diocletian, Rome could tell you who you could marry, what clothes you could wear, what businesses you could or could not operate, what religions you had to practice or to shun, and so on. If you go with the loose definition Diocletian was definitely a totalitarian - but so was Augustus. The main distinction there is that Diocletian was vastly more ambitious in his efforts to run people's lives on his own terms.

The more restrictive definition of _totalitarian_  stresses the quality of the obedience demanded by the state. In this version the state asserts total control over the lives and property of the individual citizens, but more importantly it does so with with no fixed limits to its claims. Not only can the state impoverish you or put you to death, a real totalitarian state reserves the right to kill you tomorrow for doing exactly what it told you to do today: one of the things that set the Hitler and Stalin apart from run-of-the-mill dictators was their knack for demanding absolute obedience to a series of completely fluid principles: The only fixed point was obedience itself, not obedience to a cause or a fixed set of ideals that might constrain their power. Augustus, for example, wasn't a real totalitarian in this sense, because despite possessing the power of life and death over everyone in the empire he made a public point of constraining his use of that power in very conventional Republican forms: he was willing to be constrained by law and precedent even though -- as the personal leader of the only military forces that mattered -- he could do whatever he wanted.

On that second, more restrictive scale Diocletian is right on the borderline. He clearly thought of himself as a defender of Roman tradition (his favorite title was _restitutor orbis, '_ Restorer of the world'). He did try to create a binding legal structure that would create an orderly and legitimate succession of power (the [Tetrarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrarchy)). He sponsored a very far-reaching and systematic codification of legal procedure and precedents and promoted the idea of a regular, predictable and uniform code across the empire.

On the other hand he completely demolished whatever was left of the Republican heritage, ruling frankly and openly as a _dominus:_ the word which earlier Romans would only use when speaking of a slave-owner and never for a their political leaders. He centralized power to a far greater extent than any of his predecessors, not even pretending to take account of the sensibilities or criticisms of civilian elites. Above all, he tried harder than any previous Roman emperor to focus loyalties of his subjects onto an idealized image of himself. That was a tradition that went back to Augustus (even farther back in the eastern provinces) but Diocletian's commitment to his own divine right was much more far reaching -- and enacted with far more violence --- than any other emperor before or afterwards. There's good reason to see this as being more of an effort to enforce conformity to the imperial ideology than an a purely theological pursuit.

All that said no ancient state possessed the kinds of resources that 20th century totalitarian regimes -- both for detailed supervision of peoples lives but also for propaganda and control of public discourse. So -- TLDR -- I wouldn't classify Diocletian as a totalitarian, just as a very autocratic authoriarian: more Francisco Franco than Hitler, more Chiang Kai-Shek than Mao.
