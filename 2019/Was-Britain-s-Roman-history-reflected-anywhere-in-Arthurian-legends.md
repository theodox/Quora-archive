Yes, in a couple of ways, but the transmission of detail is murky and essentially unreliable. The [Matter of Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_of_Britain) is a perfect example of a distorting mirror: while it’s remarkable that anything escaped the ruin of Roman Britain at all, trying to match the Arthurian canon with what we know from literary and archaeological is a maddening game of guesswork.

__British Usurpers__ 

Although the Roman legacy in later British tradition was deeply submerged, the does preserve a strong folk-memory of the tumultuous politics of the declining Roman empire, when Romano-British military commanders took their troops to the continent to establish their own claims to the imperial throne. The years 383–411 saw Roman generals [Magnus Maximus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus), [Gratian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratian_(usurper)), and [Constantine III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_III_(Western_Roman_Emperor)) all fighting to seize the Roman throne. Constantine briefly succeeded in winning a share of the throne, though his “reign” only lasted two years — but clearly this series of adventures left a lasting impression on the Romano-British population. A distorted version of these events ends up forming a large part of Arthur’s adventures.

The sixth-century monk [Gildas](http://www.vortigernstudies.org.uk/arthist/vortigernquotesgil.htm) more or less has the history correct: Here’s his version of the career of Maximus:

> the island retained the Roman name, but not the morals and law; nay rather, casting forth a shoot of its own planting, it sends out Maximus to the two Gauls, accompanied by a great crowd of followers, with an emperor's ensigns in addition, which he never worthily bore nor legitimately, but as one elected after the manner of a tyrant and amid a turbulent soldiery. This man, through cunning art rather than by valour, first attaches to his guilty rule certain neighbouring countries or provinces against the Roman power, by nets of perjury and falsehood. He then extends one wing to Spain, the other to Italy, fixing the throne of his iniquitous empire at Trier, and raged with such madness against his lords that he drove two legitimate emperors, the one from Rome, the other from a most pious life. Though fortified by hazardous deeds of so dangerous a character, it was not long ere he lost his accursed head at Aquileia: he who had in a way cut off the crowned heads of the empire of the whole world.

However the history was eventually mixed with romantic fantasy. The eleventh century Welsh [Dream of Maxen Wledig](https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/mab/mab28.htm) depicts Maximus as a legitimate emperor who came _to_  Britain to wed a bride he saw in a dream. [Geoffrey of Monmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_of_Monmouth) who is the most important of the Arthurian sources, rather splits the difference: his Maximus is a Roman Senator (mis-named Maximianus) and a descendant of emperor Constantine who weds a British princess, though Geoffrey correctly has him fighting and dying against the legitimate emperors* in Italy. However Geoffrey adds a new twist: here Constantine III appears as a rescuer who comes from the continent to relieve the Britons from barbarians. And — most importantly — to connect the “imperial line” of Constantine I and Maximianus with king Arthur.

> When they had made all necessary preparations, they embarked, and arrived at the port of Totness; and then without delay assembled together the youth that was left in the island, and encountered the enemy; over whom, by the merit of the holy prelate, they obtained the victory. After this the Britons, before dispersed, flocked together from all parts, and in a council held at Silchester, promoted Constantine to the throne, and there performed the ceremony of his coronation. They also married him to a lady, descended from a noble Roman family, whom archbishop Guithelin had educated and by whom the king had afterwards three sons, Constans, Aurelius Ambrosius, and Uther Pendragon.

In most of the classic version of the Arthur story we actually get a peculiar mix of these different stories. Arthur goes to war against the (fictional) emperor “[Lucius Tiberius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tiberius),” conquering Rome and making himself emperor in the process. However it’s alright, because the Romans are portrayed as arrogant and in any case Arthur’s is descended from Constantine III and thus Constantine I, the first Christian emperor . Here’s Malory’s version of Arthur telling off the envoys of emperor Lucius:

> the demand grieveth me sore, for truly I will never pay truage to Rome, wherefore I pray you to counsel me. I have understood that Belinus and Brenius, kings of Britain, have had the empire in their hands many days, and also Constantine the son of Heleine, which is an open evidence that we owe no tribute to Rome but of right we that be descended of them have right to claim the title of the empire.

_Arthur (crowned, right) fighting Lucius of Rome (crowned, center). Note the anachronistic imperial double-eagle flown by Lucius’ troops._ 

By this point (Malory, writing in the 1400’s, is a thousand years distant from the fall of Roman Britain) things have gotten quite confused on several levels. [Belinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belinus) gets his name, at least, from the Celtic sun god [Belenus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belenus); [Brenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brennius) is a refererence to the historical [Brennus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brennus_(4th_century_BC)) who did in fact sack Rome in 390 BC. However the wobbly literary tradition has transformed him into a “king of Britain” who conquered Rome.

So, by the time of the classic Arthurian romances the messy politics of late-Roman Britain have been transformed into a dynastic saga; Arthur has been grafted into the family of emperor Constantine, and the abandonment of Roman Britain has been symbolically redeemed by a British king subduing the continent — even though the reality of the fifth and sixth centuries was quite the reverse.

__Roman Resistance__ 

Another theme which survives, though again in a very tenuous fashion, is the resistance of the Christian Romano-British society to the[ invasion of the pagan Saxons and Angles ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_settlement_of_Britain)after the end of Roman power in the islands. The withdrawal of the legions at the end of the fourth century and the subsequent retreat of urban, Roman, Christian Britain is part of the background of the Arthur stories but the details are poorly preserved.

Gildas says that the Saxons were invited to Britain by an unnnamed “proud tyrant” who wanted their help against the Picts. The Saxons, however, wanted more money than the “tyrant” would or could provide and began to take the east of England by force. We don’t have much other material against which we can check his account but this is still basis of most standard accounts today.

Gildas records a battle between Romano-British forces and the invading Saxons at [Mons Badonicus](http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/celts_18.html), around the year 516. Most scholar accept this as a historical event, since Gildas himself says it happened in the year he was born. Gildas never mentions the leader of the Britons, but depending on who you read it it may be that Gildas assigns the credit to a Romano-British nobleman name [Ambrosius Aurelianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrosius_Aurelianus):

> [Ambrosius Aurelianus] was a man of unassuming character, who, alone of the Roman race chanced to survive in the shock of such a storm (as his parents, people undoubtedly clad in the purple, had been killed in it), whose offspring in our days have greatly degenerated from their ancestral nobleness.

_Late-Roman cavalry carried the Draco, a dragon-shaped standard, into battle. This 9th century Carolingian manuscript shows king David, anachronistically equipped as one of Charlemagne’s counts, following the Draco. Image:_ _[Wikimedia Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Psalter_of_St._Gallen#/media/File:Psalterium_aureum_140_Ioab.jpg)_ 

By the ninth century, the [Historia Brittonum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Brittonum#Vortigern_and_Ambrosius) attributes this victory at Badon to Arthur. Ambrosius has become a quasi-magical figure who rules the western parts of Britain. Ambrosius is also described as a “son of a consul” — which is unlikely to be historical in the most literal sense, but its not unreasonable to think that the provincial upper classes formed the core of Roman Britain’s rearguard actions. In the fully-blown 12th century version of Geoffrey, “Aurelius Ambrosius”, is the brother of Uther Pendragon, and those Arthur’s uncle.

Between Gildas and the classic 11th and 12th century sources there are many confusing details about the arrival of the Saxons and the wars that accompanied them. Trying to reconcile them with anything like real history has been a cottage industry since the 19th century.

One of the most plausible — though it should be stressed, _far_ from the only! — historical model for Arthur’s kingdom is the kingdom of [Dumnonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumnonia), a Romano-British state in Devon and Cornwall which held out against the Saxons until at least the seventh century. Dumnonia was only peripheral to Roman Britain proper — [Isca Dumnoniorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isca_Dumnoniorum), modern Exeter, is literally at the end of a Roman road — but Roman or perhaps more accurately semi-Roman culture in lingered in Dumnonia longer than in the east of England. The rulers of that region were still using Roman names such as [Clemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemen_ap_Bledric) (obviously “Clemens”) and [Constantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_(Briton)) and supporting the Christian church against the pagan Saxons. By the 12th century Geoffrey makes Constantine into Arthur’s successor, though he’s unclear on the family relationship. This of course also reflects Geoffrey’s muddled connection between the emperor Constantine, the usurper Constantine III, and Arthur; it might (might!) reflect a kind of legitimizing claim by the post-Roman but still Roman-inflected kingdom of Dumnonia.

Many of famous Arthurian sites are located in Dumnonian territory: [Tintagel,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintagel) where Arthur was conceived and Glastonbury Abbey, where he was supposedly buried are both in the traditional Dumnonian realm. Arthur’s less famous court was at [Caerleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerleon) (from _castra legionis_  “camp of the legions”) across the Bay of Cornwall, and it’s worth pointing out that in this period sea travel was easier and faster than overland journeys. Mark of Cornwall and Tristan are from Cornwall, as was Arthur’s mother Ygraine. Athurian legends are frequently connected to Brittany, and the Breton kingdom of [Domnonée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domnon%C3%A9e) (in Geoffrey of Monmouth, Ambrosius and Uther Pen2dragon are spirited out of England to Brittany to escape from Vortigern).

However it’s important to remember that the Dumnonian connection is only one conjecture; there are plenty of others. What they all share — alas for the historian — is vagueness and confusion. It is safe to say that some dim memory of the rearguard fight of Christian, Roman culture in Britain is embedded in the Arthurian mythos. It does say a lot about the continued vitality of this “British” (as opposed to Anglo-Saxon) culture that so much of Arthur’s mystique has a distinctive Celtic tinge. Nobody knows for certain how that very Atlantic subject matter ended up in the hands of the French troubadours like [Chrétien de Troyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chr%C3%A9tien_de_Troyes); perhaps it was the influence of the Irish monasteries which studded northern Europe in the Carolingian period, or perhaps it spread outward from Brittany. In any case the classic Arthur of courtly love, round tables, and Holy Grails is very far removed from any embattled Romano-British aristocrat trying to hold the Saxons at bay, but the retains a few tenuous links to fading days of Roman Britain.
