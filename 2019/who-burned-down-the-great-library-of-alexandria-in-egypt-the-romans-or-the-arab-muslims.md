It was the Romans. [The best evidence suggests that the library was mostly destroyed in the fighting between Julius Caesar’s troops and various Ptolemaic factions in 47 BC.](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-responsible-for-the-destruction-of-the-library-of-Alexandria/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=b1c501af&srid=zLvM) The surviving accounts depict this as collateral damage — a side effect of the [siege of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Alexandria_(47_BC)) and not a deliberate act of vandalism.

The story about the Arabs burning the library is a [very late, dubious fiction](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Muslims-burn-the-Great-Library-of-Alexandria/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=5a942709&srid=zLvM). In fact, all the stories about people _deliberately_  burning the library are fairly late and they all seem to share a common desire to paint somebody as a fanatical villain, though the “somebody” in question varies depending on who you ask.
