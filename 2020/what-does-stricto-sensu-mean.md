Almost what it sounds like in English — “in a strict sense”. You’d use it to indicate that you’re talking about the most narrow and precise meaning of a phrase.

For example, many people toss the word “literally” around simply for emphasis when, _stricto sensu_ , it ought only to be used to distinguish between the way something was written and how it is being interpreted.
