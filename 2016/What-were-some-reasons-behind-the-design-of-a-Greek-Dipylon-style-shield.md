We've never found one intact as far as I know so it's going to be guesswork. There's an attempt are reconstructing one here: [RECONSTRUCTION OF DIPYLON SHIELD](http://koryvantesstudies.org/studies-in-english-language/page205-2/)

 The authors, at least, think that the outsize shield made body armor unnecessary. The lateral gaps would work for proto-hoplite tactics, which involved a lot of shield-to-shield pushing -- a notch would allow the user to thrust a spear without compromising his own protection too much.

As long as the shield were used in something like the historical hoplite phalanx the off-side cutout would offer the same protection and opportunity to thrust to the next guy in line.



 It's also suggested that the cutouts made it more comfortable to wear slung over one's back - otherwise the wearer's elbows would be banging into it while walking. 

The style is a historical descendant of the Mycenean era figure-8 shield:

 So there may be 'style' considerations as well. The Hittites evidently used the same shape as well. 



You can apparently buy one for yourself and do some experiments on your own: [Ασπιδα τυπου "Διπυλου"](http://hellenicarmors.gr/products.php?pageId=17)
