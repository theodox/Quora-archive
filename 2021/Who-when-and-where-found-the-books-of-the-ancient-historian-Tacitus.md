Tacitus was not widely known in the Middle Ages or the early Renaissance: even somebody like [Petrarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch) knew Tacitus merely as a name. The last ancient mention of Tacitus by name comes in the sixth century, apart from two citations of the _Germania._ Otherwise, his work was basically forgotten for the next millennium and only became widely read again during the heyday of Italian classicism.

What we call the _Histories_ is really part of a larger work which included, or at least used to be circulated alongside, the _Annals_ . Another manuscript in Florence, [Plutei 68.2](http://mss.bmlonline.it/s.aspx?Id=AWOItV6GI1A4r7GxMMC1&c=Cornelius%20Tacitus,%20et%20Apuleius%20longobardis%20characteribus%20exarati#/book), contains books 11–16 of that original 30 (Annals is books 1–6). It comes from the abbey of [Monte Cassino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Cassino) and was done sometime in the 11th century (both easily visible from the handwriting, a style known as [Beneventan ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneventan_script)which was widely disliked by later readers). After about the 14ht century this manuscript and copies of it circulated among Italian scholars intent on retrieving examples of “pure” classical Latin. It somehow ended up in the private library of [Boccaccio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Boccaccio), and later [Niccolo de Niccoli ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_de%27_Niccoli)seems to have “borrowed” it . Tacitus’ reputation in this period however was not high; he was seen as inferior in style to Cicero and less entertaining than Livy. Nonetheless there was a high premium on all things Roman, so a [printed edition](https://data.cerl.org/istc/it00006000) appeared in 1471 in Venice from the press of [Vindelinus de Spira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_and_Wendelin_of_Speyer).

The surviving texts of the _Annals_ all seem to derive from a different manuscript [Plutei 68.1,](http://mss.bmlonline.it/s.aspx?Id=AWOIt4y5I1A4r7GxMMW5&c=Cornelius%20Tacitus#/book) now in the Laurentian library in Florence. There’s some debate about the dating of the manuscript: the Laurentian official date is around the year 1000, but other people date it as far back as 850 based on the style of the handwriting. It was probably copied at the abbey of [Fulda ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_Abbey_of_Fulda)but at some point ended up in the library of the abbey of [Corvey,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_Abbey_of_Corvey) where it seems to have been ignored for several hundred years. It finally ended up in the being published in printed form in 1517.

Machiavelli, who identified strongly with the suppressed Republican idealism of Tacitus, helped revive interest in Tacitus — there’s debate about whether or not he had actually read the _Annals,_ which appeared in print only after _The Prince_  was already published but which were known while he was writing. In the early modern era Tacitus would be a central figure in the European debates about monarchy, republicanism and liberty.

The essays we know as the _Germania_ , _Agricola_ , and _Dialogus_ were even more obscure. The only surviving original is [Codex Aesinas Latina 8 ](http://digitale.bnc.roma.sbn.it/tecadigitale/manoscrittoantico/BNCR_Ms_VE_1631/BNCR_Ms_VE_1631/135)(since it was sold to the Italian government is’s also now “Cod. Vitt. Em. 1631.11”) which looks to be a Carolingian copy from the 9th century, with additions — including the beginning and end of the _Germania_ — added by hand in the 15th century by the scholar Stefano Guarnieri. The additions came from a manuscript — now lost — from the abbey of Herzfeld in the 9th century ; there are good contemporary descriptions of [the lost manuscript](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Hersfeldensis). The [Aesinas narrowly escaped being stolen by the Nazis](https://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2015/04/22/some-notes-on-the-modern-history-of-the-codex-aesinas-of-tacitus-germania-c/): Hitler was extremely interested in obtaining the oldest existing record of the _Germania_  but Mussolini put him off; after the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy the SS tried to find the manuscript but failed.

_The lovely Carolinigian chapter heading of the_ Codex Aesinas 8_at the end of the_ Agricola _and the beginning of the_ Germania

Interestingly it does appear that the _Germania_ at least was quoted in the Carolingian era (by Rudolf of Fulda) and by Guibert of Nogent (in the 11th century). Both were Benedictine monks, so this ms. might originate in Fulda and have been discussed among the Benedictine communities elsewhere.
