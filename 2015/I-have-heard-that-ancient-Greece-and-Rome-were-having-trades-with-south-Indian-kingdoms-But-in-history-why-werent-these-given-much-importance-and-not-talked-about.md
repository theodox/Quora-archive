# I have heard that ancient Greece and Rome were having trades with south Indian kingdoms. But in history, why weren't these given much importance and not talked about?

It's pretty important for specialists, but it tends to get less attention from general readers.

After Alexander, the Greek world's main route to trade with India was an overland through the [Seleucid Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire), which shared a border with the Mauryans:

This was a very old route, going back to early Bronze Age if not before -- but because it was overland it was slow, dangerous and expensive. Only very valuable commodities were worth taking. The Seleucids had a monopoly on the western end of the trade and kept prices high. They also monopolized the trade in elephants to keep them out of the hands of their rivals.

The [Ptolemaic dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty) in Egypt -- who were deadly rivals of the Seleucids -- was always interested in a sea route to India. For centuries there was a trickle of trade along the coasts. Finally a few decades before the Roman's conquered Egypt (under Caesar in 60BC) the Ptolemies figured out how to use the monsoons to create a regular annual convoy directly across the Indian Ocean. From Arsinoe (modern Suez) and Berenike (near the border with Sudan) there were regular sailings in large numbers in the 1st and 2d centuries AD, using specially designed ships.

It was a pretty brisk trade:



> There are imported into this market-town ([Barigaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barigaza)), wine, Italian preferred, also Laodicean and Arabian; copper, tin, and lead; coral and topaz; thin clothing and inferior sorts of all kinds; bright-colored girdles a cubit wide; storax, sweet clover, flint glass, realgar, antimony, gold and silver coin, on which there is a profit when exchanged for the money of the country; and ointment, but not very costly and not much. And for the King there are brought into those places very costly vessels of silver, singing boys, beautiful maidens for the harem, fine wines, thin clothing of the finest weaves, and the choicest ointments. There are exported from these places spikenard, costus, bdellium, ivory, agate and carnelian, lycium, cotton cloth of all kinds, silk cloth, mallow cloth, yarn, long pepper and such other things as are brought here from the various market-towns. Those bound for this market-town from Egypt make the voyage favorably about the month of July, that is Epiphi.


The Romans were especially fond of spices and silks; the Indians of Roman glass, metalwork, and precious metals. The Romans also imported exotic animals; its how they got this tiger for the arena:

The trade seems to have declined during the 3rd century (this was a very bad period for Rome, with many civil wars; I'm not sure how much the slowdown in trade reflects developments in India at the same time. However it picked up again after the 4th century and continued down until the Arab conquests finally cut the Romans (by then, the Byzantines) off from the Red Sea and Indian Ocean for good in the 8th century. [Cosmas Indicopleustes ](http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962) , an Alexandrian merchant, left an account of his travels as far as Sri Lanka in the 6th century.
