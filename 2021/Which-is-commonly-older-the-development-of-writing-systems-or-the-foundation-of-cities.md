Urbanism is way more common than literacy — there have been quite a few illiterate civilizations. The oldest cities predate the oldest writing systems by several thousand years.

Though there are arguments about who gets the prizes for both “oldest city” and “oldest writing system” the gap between, say, Jericho (roughly 9500 BC) and cuneiform writing (around 3500 BC) shows how unambiguous the answer is.
