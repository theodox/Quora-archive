Ἆρ΄ἐρωτᾷς τίς μὲν ἐγώ, τίσ δ΄ ὁ Φίλιππος;

Then, you ask, who am I and who is Philippos?

Ἆρ΄ or ἄρα if followed by a consonant is a particle for introducing a new idea that follows an earlier one. Sort of like “Then…” or “so…” in English.

ἐρωτᾷς = “you ask” it’s second person verb, the “you” is implied by the ending. In this case it could also be translated as ‘you may ask…’ but that’s a quirk of this particular verb, usually _I xxxx_ and_I may xxxx_ are differentiated by slightly different endings.

τίς μὲν… τίσ δ΄ (the δ’ is shortened for δε) is a very Greek construction for two parallel things - sometimes its translated as ‘on the one hand… on the other’.

ἐγώ is just “I” and ὁ Φίλιππος is “Philippos”, a person’s name. They are both nominatives, so they are should go with a verb — but there is not one for them since the “you” that goes with ἐρωτᾷς is the subject of the sentence. In this kind of situation Greek let’s you skip “am” and “is” , as in English “Who’s he? the cable guy.” with no verb.
