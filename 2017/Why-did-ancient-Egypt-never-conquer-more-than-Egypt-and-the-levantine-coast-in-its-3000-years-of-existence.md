# Why did ancient Egypt never conquer more than Egypt and the levantine coast in its 3000 years of existence?

Actually, Egypt got a little farther than that. At the peak of its power, under [Thutmose I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_I), right around 1500 BC, they got as far as the Euphrates and the Taurus mountains

But what that map leaves out is the context. The modern Middle east is drier and hotter than it was in the Bronze Age — but the basics haven’t changed _that_ much. Compare that map with this:

And you’ll notices how little of the “unconquered” regions to the immediate east and west of Egypt are very appetizing . Lots of things happened over the 3000 years, but this was always the basic strategic fact. Egypt’s strategic frontiers all connected to powerful rivals

__Strategic options__ 

It’s also worth pointing out that the Egyptians were never real blue-water sailors. The predictable environment of the the Nile doesn’t teach a lot of the skills you need to long ocean voyages and Egypt is not overly blessed with good shipbuilding woods; one reason that the Levant was the arena of “superpower conflicts” in antiquity is that the Lebanon was the best source of timber for both Egypt and its Mesopotamian rivals. In later times, when a Pharoah was interested in exploring southward along the coast of Africa, he hired a Phoenician crew. The farthest destination that the Egyptians wrote about visiting was the [Land of Punt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Punt) — which is usually thought to be on the Somali coast of the Red Sea. So, the Egyptians remained fundamentally a land power.

To the south, the main habitable route was up the the Nile. However that’s a difficult direction to expand: The river descends in [fast moving cataracts](http://www.wisegeek.org/what-are-the-cataracts-of-the-nile.htm#didyouknowout) through narrow, rocky valleys — and up river were a succession of [powerful Nubian kingdoms](https://oi.uchicago.edu/museum-exhibits/history-ancient-nubia) ( one of whom [conquered Egypt)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt). Egyptians often recruited Nubians as mercenaries and internal security troops, but they were never able to subdue them past the second cataract (around where Lake Nasser is now). It’s not a surprise, given the difficulty of the terrain and the limited number of routes.

If you follow the most appealing land routes north from Egypt northwards, you’ll generally end up following the same route Thuthmose did: north and east through Canaan and Phoenicia. This, too, is a fairly tough area for campaigning. It’s studded with fortified city-states that have to be taken one by one. But worse, once you’ve pushed through you run into a series of powerful rivals.

__Rivals__ 

In the later Bronze Age, the [Hittites ](http://www.ancient.eu/hittite/)dominated Anatolia and northern Syria; they were powerful warriors and — unlike the Egyptians — they had good access to iron weapons and armor. They fought the Egyptians several times, most notably at the [Battle of Kadesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kadesh) where the Egyptians nearly suffered a humiliating disaster. The Egyptians had to recognize the Hittites as equals; they signed a [peace treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%E2%80%93Hittite_peace_treaty) (Ramses II eventually married a Hittite princess) and in general the were content to work through local proxies in a kind of Bronze-Age cold war. On the other side of the Euphrates, the powerful Syrian Kingdom of [Mitanni](http://www.ancient.eu/Mitanni/) was another formidable opponent, since they dominated both the east-west and north-south trade routes. The Egyptians sometimes allied with the Mitanni against the Hittites, but it was an alliance of opportunity.

The Hittite and Mitanni states fragmented after the [Bronze Age Collapse](https://www.quora.com/What-caused-the-Bronze-Age-Collapse), and Egypt only [barely survived](http://www.ancient-origins.net/history-important-events/battle-delta-ramses-iii-saves-egypt-people-sea-003119). The chaos took more than a century to subside, and by the time the dust settled a new potential enemy had arisen to the east: the second incarnation of the [Assyrian Empire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire)

_Among their other innovations, the Assyrians specialized in grisly methods of execution._ 

Assyria was a ferocious enemy, the terror of the ancient world. They were masters of siegecraft and fielded a tough, disciplined infantry. Assyria gobbled up all of Mesopotamia , the former Mitanni lands, and much of the Levant between about 1000 and 750 BC. By about 750 BC they were pushing the Egyptians steadily out of Canaan. The Bible’s book of Isaiah, which covers this period, put it like this:

> Behold, you are trusting in Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.

__Decline and fall__ 

Isaiah was right: Egyptian power was in terminal decline by this point. In fact, Isaiah’s Pharoah wasn’t even an Egyptian — he was a [Nubian of the 25th dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt) which conquered Egypt from the south in 760. The Nubians were in turn conquered by the Assyrian emperor [Esarhaddon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esarhaddon) in 671 BC, briefly uniting the core of the ancient civilized world in a single empire. But the Assyrian colossus fell quickly too, in a series of revolts coordinated by their subjects in Babylon and Persia. The Egyptians got out from under the yoke for a while, but lost their independence to the Persians again in 525. The Egyptians drove out the Persians with help from Greek mercenaries in 404, but the Persians returned in 342. Alexander defeated the Persians a decade later, but the Egyptians remained under his successors — and then the Romans — for the next thousand years.
