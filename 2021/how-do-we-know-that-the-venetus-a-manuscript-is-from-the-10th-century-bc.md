The easy way to tell is the just by looking: this text has [lower case letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_minuscule) and word breaks. This was a style of writing which only emerged in the 9th century, so the text can’t be older than that. One of the scribes who added the the scholia (the “marginal notes”) wrote in a more old-fashioned hand, a semi-uncial script more like what you would have seen in a late Antique manuscript. This suggests that the work comes from relatively early in the [Macedonian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_Renaissance) when older styles of writing were just beginning to fade out. The book is written on goatskin parchment, which was less popular in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

_A portion of folio 45, with the Iliad text on the left and the scholia at right. Note the older style all-caps “semi-uncial” heading at center right._ 

The upper end of the possible date range is visible in the earlier portions of the volume (not Homer: the [Chrestomathy of Proclus](https://books.google.com/books/about/Procli_chrestomathia_poetica.html?id=Gr9hjgEACAAJ)). This section includes illustrations which were added later — they overwrite some of the text — and they look like 12th century Byzantine art (you could compare, for example, the [Madrid Skylitzes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Skylitzes) which is late 12th century).

_A snipped of the Proclus text in the same volume, with illustrations._ 

So a date range between the 12th and 10th century makes sense, probably on the early end of that range. I don’t believe anybody has tried c-14 dating though it would be possible — however we don’t know how long the un-written parchment might have been stored before use so it would not completely resolve the dating



_Key point: 10th century AD, not BC (I edited the question topic)_
