They don’t need food or water, but there’s another logistics thing to consider.

__VERY CAREFULLY.__ 

The Peloponnessus is about 2,154,960 hectares (ie, 100 x 100 m squares). So you can fit everybody in there pretty well; each of those two million hectares can accommodate ten thousand Spartans in a looser order than their traditional formation. We’ll have to hand-wave around some of the issues about slopes and lake beds, but there’s plenty of slop, everybody should in fact be able to lie down .

Which they’ll probably need to do for reasons that will become apparent quickly.

Consider this:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-69a478518b56fc46f34176e56646ba53)

The entire Spartan lochos, to get out of the Peloponnessus , has to cross the six bridges which connect the Peloponnessus to mainland Greece. There are two railroad bridges, two big highway bridges, and two floating bridges

The road bridges carry the equivalent of maybe 15 lanes of traffic across the canal. Let’s count the railroad bridges as adding the equivalent of 3 more. If you use a generous US-style 3.6 meter road width, that’s just about 65 meters worth of footing. Let’s be say our Spartans can squeeze into a 75 cm / 2.4 foot rank. That will let us fit maybe 85 or so Spartans across..

This means your Spartans are going to have to queue up to cross those bridges. For __quite some time.__ 

We can only handle 85 Spartans abreast; that means that only about 85 Spartans will emerge from the bridge per second. For those of you following along at home that’s __82,352,942__  seconds (rounding up, to account for people tripping). Or, to put it another way, just a hair over __2.6 years ,__ crossing those poor little bridges 24/7. This is assuming flawless Spartan discipline, with each soldier queued up and ready to go — nobody getting distracted while talking to the Spartan next door, nobody passing out from heat prostration while waiting around all day in the hot sun wearing a bronze corselet, nobody stopping to loot a local gyro stand — just seven billion dudes lockstepping their way in perfectly optimal fashion across those bridges.

For two and a half years.

The good news? NATO is going to have _plenty_ of time to plan their response. Or, you know, to just blow up the bridges.

But it gets worse for the Spartans. Our seven billion Spartans don’t eat, fine. But do they… ya know… ?

Because remember, seven billion Spartans is about the same as the current world population. Which generates __290 billion kg (= 640 billion lbs)__ of solid waste per year. Now, the numbers of Spartans the Peloponnesus will be going down as those boys lockstep across the bridges, so the actual total will only be about__377,000,000 kg (= 83,1142,728 lbs) of sludge__ over the 31 months it takes to march out__.__ Think about that for a moment.

Wait, don’t. Really, don’t.

But my considered advice to the young Spartan on the make is _get to the head of the line, pronto!._  Of course, the numbers get better, for a given value of “better”, if there’s a massive outbreak of cholera. Which there will be.

The literal meaning of Thermopylae is “the hot gates”. Just sayin’.

But here’s the thing. All of this sounds pretty unpleasant — even Gerard Butler is likely to lose his … erm…. _stuff_ … waiting around in line for 31 months just to get to grips with the enemy. But you have to remember that the Spartans __were very averse to manual labor__ . A proud Spartan warrior did not cook and clean and hump a bedroll for himself. That’s what helots are for.

And typically you bring about three helots for every Spartan; those bronze greaves ain’t gonna polish themselves.

So to support our 7 billion Spartans we need an additional __21 billion helots__ .

I really don’t want to go there.
