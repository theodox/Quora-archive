Yes — the [Coptic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language) is the modern descendant of ancient Egyptian. It was knowledge of Coptic that enabled the translators of the 19th century to begin deciphering hieroglyphics.

Coptic survives today primarily as a liturgical language for Egypt’s Christian minority (similar the way Latin lived on in Catholic churches after it ceased to be an everyday language). There are a handful of communities in Egypt that use it for everyday purposes as well but on the whole it has been displaced by Arabic.
