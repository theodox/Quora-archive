No, the Assyrians are relative latecomers. Archaeologists date the urbanization of Assur around 2600 BC — more than a thousand years after [Uruk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk_period) and the city-states of Sumer.

You can see the historical relationship in Assyrian records: [Ashurbanipal](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-the-first-archaeologist/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=591f3fb2&srid=zLvM) (r. 661–639 BC) , the last successful Assyrian empire, prided himself on having learned proper Sumerian and his ability to read the “ I read the cunning tablets of Sumer.” He even had himself depicted in the regalia of a Sumerian _ensi:_ already an established tradition in the 27th century BC when the first bricks of Assur were being laid.
