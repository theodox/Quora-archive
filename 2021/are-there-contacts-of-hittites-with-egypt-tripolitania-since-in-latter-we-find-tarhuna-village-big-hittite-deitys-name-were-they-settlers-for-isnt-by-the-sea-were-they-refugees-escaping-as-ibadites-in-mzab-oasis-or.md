# Are there contacts of Hittites with Egypt-Tripolitania, since in latter, we find Tarhuna village, big Hittite deity's name? Were they settlers, for isn't by the sea? Were they refugees escaping, as Ibadites in Mzab oasis or a colony as Phoenicians?

It’s most likely a coincidence of sounds. Evidently the name is an Amazigh / Berber tribal name — I’d try to find somebody with more knowledge of the language to find out if it is meaningful or preserves some older name.

The Hittites had fairly close diplomatic relations with the New Kingdom from around 1260 BC to the end of the Hittite empire in the following century — but not so intimate that you’d expect a refugee-resettlement program, especially since several Hittite successor states survived in what’s now northern Syria. You could look to see if there was ever a Roman-era temple of [Jupiter Dolichenus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Dolichenus), who was a sort of amalgam of the Syrian storm god Hadad and Anatolian meterological deities — he borrows a few graphic motifs from Anatolia. However it feels unlikely.

If you’re looking for traces of [Tarḫunna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar%E1%B8%ABunna) you might try closer to (his) home, since the Luwian god [Tarḫunz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar%E1%B8%ABunz) is quite close in role and name. I don’t know how a professional etymologist would take it but it’s tempting to see it as the root of the name [Tarcondimotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarcondimotus_I) (surviving in Roman-era Cilicia).
