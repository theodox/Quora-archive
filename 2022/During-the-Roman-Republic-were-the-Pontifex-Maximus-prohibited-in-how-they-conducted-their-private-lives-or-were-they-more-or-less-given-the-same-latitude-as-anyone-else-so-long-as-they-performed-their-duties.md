# During the Roman Republic, were the Pontifex Maximus prohibited in how they conducted their private lives, or were they more or less given the same latitude as anyone else so long as they performed their duties?

Most Roman priesthoods came with a raft of restrictions on personal matters. However, the restrictions on a pontifex were light, especially compared to the [extremely complicated rules which burdened the Flamen Dialis, the chief priest of Jupiter](https://qr.ae/pvP6AG).

A pontifex was primarily a jurist and and administrator — the sacred equivalent of a consul — rather than a ritualist who was bound by a web of complex taboos. The pontifex’s presided over questions of religious law, which in Rome included most of what we’d call family law (wills, adoptions, divorces and so on). He was also the final authority on matters of ritual detail (_is it permissible to conduct this festival if it has rained today?_ or _What do we do if the sacrificial animal escapes and runs away before the rite is complete?_ ). The pontifex was not usually the individual who interpreted omens or auspices but he was responsible for helping to devise the proper ritual response to them.

Essentially, a pontifex was an interpreter of tradition and a guardian of precedent. It was a role more like that of a Jewish rabbi than that of a Catholic priest. Although the pontifex did have ritual obligations they were secondary to his role as the arbiter of traditional mores. Unlike most Roman priests, a pontifex was expected to be learned and pious.* Greek writers, such as Dionysius of Halicarnassus, often referred to them as _hierophantai,_ “interpreters of divine things” rather than as _hiereîs,_ “priests.”

Here’s the relatively limited rules a pontifex had to follow independent of the intricate web of ritual details which governed specific rites or observances.

Originally, a pontifex had to be the child of a marriage carried out by _[conferratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confarreatio)_ _,_ the most old-fashioned and aristocratic form of marriage. It’s not clear if this regulation survived once the office was opened to plebeians in the early third century BC.

A pontifex was expected to reside in the [Regia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regia), the “king’s house” in the center of the Forum. This was, for example, where Caesar was living at the time of his assassination; the [temple which Augustus created to honor him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Caesar) was built across the street from Caesar’s last home.

In theory, the pontifex was prohibited from leaving first Rome, and then later Italy. Since many pontifices were also important magistrates, however, this requirement seems to have been ignored in practice by the later Republic: certainly Caesar and [his successor in the office, Lepidus ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4436775)both spent years outside of Italy.

Unlike several of the other Roman priests., a pontifex maximus was allowed to serve in the military. This illustrates how the role was closer to that of a magistrate than to that of a ritualist, since most rites were forbidden to those who had come in contact with blood or dead bodies. However a pontifex did have observe the laws of ritual purity when performing specifically ritual functions; typically this would involve a special form of washing or the use of incense.

In official settings a pontifex carried a special knife, known as a [secespita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secespita), and wore a distinctive set of robes rather than a magistrate’s toga. In sacrificial settings he either carried or was accompanied by someone carrying a [dolabra](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:id=dolabra-cn), a kind of pickaxe used for dispatching sacrificial animals.

When conducting ceremonies, like most Roman officiants, he was required to cover his head.

There were almost certainly hundreds of minor ritual taboos or observances associated with specific actions, though we can only glean a few of them from our sources. But, on the whole, the ritual burden of being a pontifex was not much different from that of any secular magistracy — very much unlike the extremely circumscribed life of a flamen or of the rex sacrorum.



* In the last century or so of the Republic, when the role became highly politicized, this dimension was largely ignored. Originally the college of pontifices was a self-selecting group which chose new members for itself when older members died. However after 300 BC the office became elective and was opened to plebeians, which led to it becoming more and more involved in the rough-and-tumble of electoral politics. In classic Roman fashion the pretense of self-selection was maintained: the electors didn’t choose a new pontiff, they told the college of which pontiff to choose for themselves.

Eventually control of the office passed to the emperors, who sometimes filled it themselves or used it as a privileged reward. Propriety demanded that a pontifex would defer to the opinion of his better-educated subordinates, not unlike a Renaissance pope delegating matters of theological or ritual purity to his entourage.
