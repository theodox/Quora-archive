The big difference has to do with the way those writing systems are used: a system whose only users are a small group of highly trained professionals can be far more complex and cumbersome than those that are in general circulation. If anything the complexity can be something the professionals like, since it keeps non-experts from competing.

Consider this little bit of code from the Apollo 11 guidance program:

_Note the comments in the right column: “TEMPORARY, I HOPE HOPE HOPE”. Programming hasn’t changed that much in 50 years!_ 

Compare it to his little bit of Python:

The first one is a system that only a very highly trained professional could hope to use. The second is at least comprehensible to a newcomer with a minimal amount of attention. In 1968 programming was an esoteric specialty; nowadays it’s something that gets taught to middle-schoolers and therefore it has to be simpler.

Of course — and the analogy holds up here pretty well — the modern idiom isn’t just simpler: it’s also far more flexible and adaptable than the older one precisely because it’s being used by so many people for so many different purposes.
