They certainly did, but the relationship was very fraught. Greek culture generally started from a position of power, so the Greek and Jewish opinions of each other were inseparable from the fact that generally Greeks were the rulers and Jews the ruled during the time their cultures intersected.

Jewish-Greek relations really started after Alexander overthrew the Persian Empire (of which the Jews were, generally, loyal subjects). Alexander's generals divided the Middle East among themselves when he died. The Greek [Seleucid Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire), centered in modern Syria, included the territory of modern Israel. The Greek [Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom) actively sought out Jewish immigrants -- the Greek rulers of Egypt wanted soldiers and traders who would not make common cause with the native Egyptians over whom they ruled, so Alexandria -- for many centuries the intellectual and economic center of the Greek world -- had a large Jewish population.

Unfortunately both in Syria and Egypt the relationship was very strained. In Syria, the ruling dynasty -- which had no real relationship to the people it ruled, since it simply replace a previous foreign occupation with a new one -- tried to shore itself up by foisting a state religion on the various people of the empire. In many cultures this was part of a long tradition of offering divine honors to the ruler, greeted with a shrug -- but in Judaism it was a mortal affront, culminating in the [Maccabee rebellion ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabees)in the second century BCE. [Hanukkah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah) celebrates the short lived revolt that drove the Seleucid priests of Zeus out of the temple in Jerusalem.

In Alexandria, on the other hand, Jews generally prospered economically. Many Jews adopted various aspects of the surrounding Greek culture (the most notable example is [Philo of Alexandria](http://www.iep.utm.edu/philo/)) and attempted to explain Jewish beliefs in the language of Greek philosophy. The [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint) -- the Greek translation of the Hebrew bible -- is said to have been commissioned by Ptolemy II for inclusion in the famous Library of Alexandria. Judaism also gained a significant number of converts, though usually not from the upper reaches of Greek society.

As the years rolled on however, there remained many points of contention: Alexandria was a melting pot with Greek, Jewish, Egyptian and other communities which often fought (in various combinations) against each other and their rulers. During the several [Jewish–Roman wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_wars) between 65 CE and 265 CE violence in Judea often spilled over into widespread fighting in Egypt as well, including the virtual annihilation of the Jewish community in Egypt during the [Kitos War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War) (116).

The two intellectual traditions had a complicated relationship. Some Greek thinkers regarded Judaism as a 'philosophical' religion; some philosophical schools, particularly the [Neo-Platonists](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10742b.htm), found Jewish monotheism and ethics pretty congenial compared to the traditional Greek myths. Many Jews, as already noted, found ways to incorporate Greek philosophy and literature into Jewish thought (again, often in the context of Neo-Platonism). On the other hand many Greeks (generally given to cultural chauvinism) dismissed Judaism as an obscure tribal superstition, and many Jewish traditionalists dismissed Greek philosophy as decadence. The Hebrew term for an "infidel" is [Epikoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epikoros) אפיקורוס, derived from the name of the sceptical Greek philosopher [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus). Hostile Greek writers accused the Jews of “[misanthropy](https://journals.openedition.org/bcrfj/5968),” a reflexive disdain for the rest of mankind.

Outside the 'official' sources -- the ones that made it into Greek or Jewish literary tradition -- there was a complex mix of cultural borrowings in both directions.

The ultimate fusion of Greek and Jewish culture, of course, is Christianity -- which emerged first among Jews in Greek-speaking culture the Roman Empire.
