__Short answer:__ 

The appearance of a singular, unnamed “god” (Θεός, _theos)_ without introduction is an _extremely_ common Greek habit of speech; it shows up in plenty of contexts besides philosophy. In some settings, it verges on [henotheism ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henotheism)— the idea that the all of the familiar named gods are aspects of a single overarching divine presence. But in in others it feels as like a shorthand way of saying “some god”. Almost always it implies a kind of abstracted divine agency and not the kind of strongly pronounced individual personalities familiar from mythology. In short: it’s a vague, pious generality.

You can often mentally substitute “Heaven” or “the divine” or — if you’re in California — “the universe.” Any of these generalities works better than assuming the phrase refers to either one of the familiar Olympians or to a single, personal, capital-G god.

__Longer answer:__ 

Any translation is complicated by Greek’s unusual use of articles: in English we’d generally distinguish between _a_ god (ie, some god or other), _the_ god (ie, the one whose identity I expect you to know from context) and capital-G God (the presumably one and only). In Greek this distinction is really hard to draw: in classical Greek everybody gets the equivalent of “the” almost all the time, regardless of context — even personal names get an article, so you would not say “Socrates spoke to Crito” but something that’s closer to “the Socrates spoke to the Crito.” Legions of scholars have wrestled over the precise shades of meaning attached to the Greek article with reference to capital-G God in the the New Testament and the Septuagint (the Roman era Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible) without agreeing on much beyond “it’s complicated.”

However one thing is quite clear from context: when a Greek speaker deploys a singular god without context, its rarely intended as a reference to a particular individual. Often the phrasing makes it quite obvious that no individual is intended. Just to pull an easy example, Plutarch quotes Plato like this, in a context where you absolutely can’t assign an individual referent to _theos:_ 

> Since our discourse is about the gods, shall we, especially on his own birthday, admit Plato to the conference, and enquire upon what account he says (supposing it to be his sentence) that [the] god always plays the geometer? I said that this sentence was not plainly set down in any of his books; yet there are good arguments that it is his, and it is very much like his expression

(Plutarch, [Convivial Question 8.2.1](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0312%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D1))

The discussion that follows involves no effort to pin a name on which _theos_  does geometry, and it concludes with Plato’s preference for abstractions over statues and paintings

> immaterial and immortal images, in which [the] god being sung is always [the] god.

If you remove the articles it certainly sounds monotheistic: “God always geometrizes” and “God is always god.” But that’s also misleading: Plutarch’s speakers continue on for some pages, switching seamlessly from singular to plural with nary a proper name and no sense of contradiction. Here the vaguer translation of “Heaven” or “the Divine” makes the most sense.

This is just one example of legions — if anything, the sideways slip into henotheistic language is actually more common than strict adherence to the ordinary conventions of personal naming. This sort of locution is common to other polytheisms — it’s abundant in modern Hindu discourse, although it’s not any kind of universal orthodoxy.
