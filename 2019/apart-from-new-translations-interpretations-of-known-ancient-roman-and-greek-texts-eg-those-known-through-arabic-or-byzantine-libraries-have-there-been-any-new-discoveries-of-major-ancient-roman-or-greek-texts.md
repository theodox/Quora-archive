# Apart from new translations / interpretations of known ancient Roman and Greek texts (eg those known through Arabic or Byzantine libraries), have there been any new discoveries of major ancient Roman or Greek texts through 20th century archaeology?

Almost all of the big philological surprises in the 20th century come from the garbage - literally. The most famous example is the collection known as the [Oxyrhynchus papyri](http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/) — essentially, a rubbish dump from the town of Oxyrhynchus (modern El Bahnasa) in Egypt. The dry climate has preserved a huge cache of thrown-away papyri, the largest single source of Greco-Roman written original material in the world. These are not manuscripts that were copied and recopied in monasteries — they are simply whatever pieces of paper that was lying around in Ptolemaic and Roman Oxyrhynchus.

Social historians love this data because it’s almost the only source we have for the un-sexy details of life in the Greek and Roman world: there are shopping lists, wills, contracts — all sorts of day-to-day record keeping that is priceless for understanding the life of ordinary folks rather than emperors, courtiers or literary people.

However Oxyrhynchus has also [produced fragments of a few unknown literary works](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3318/04-frag-nf.html):

The most famous one might be the____ __[Ichneutae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichneutae)__  of Sophocles — a “[satyr play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr_play)” or theatrical short — which existed only as a scattering of quotations until a significant pieces was found in 1912.

Several __[unknown fragments of Sappho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_Oxyrhynchus_7)__ were also found (though technically not 20th century — it was 1898).

Significant pieces of __[Menander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menander)__ ____ also emerged from Oxyrhynchus , ranging from an almost perfectly complete copy of the __[Dyskolos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyskolos)__ ____ (published in 1952) to fragments of several unknown works. Menander’s modern reputation is far higher than it was in the 19th century, thanks largely to these finds.

Greek predominated over Latin at Oxyrhynchus, but the site did yield __[epitomes of seven of the missing 107 books of Livy’s massive Roman history](http://www.attalus.org/latin/livius.html)__  — not as good as the real thing, but still important evidence.



The other big “find” of 20th century archaeology that demands mention is the __[Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls)__ , first discovered in 1946. Although the material is generally Aramaic or Hebrew, there are also a few Greek items. The best of these manuscripts —which were deliberately hidden away, rather than simply dumped like their Egyptian counterparts — are the most complete examples of long form writing from before about the 4th century and provide invaluable insights into the religious and political landscape of Roman-era Judaea.



One last mention should go to the __[Herculaneum papyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculaneum_papyri#Virtual_unrolling)__ : the carbonized remains of a private library which was essentially “baked” during the eruption of Vesuvius in 79. To date very few of these have been successfully read, but advances in computer-aided tomography mean that there’s a real chance we’ll be able to extract some of their context in the next decade or two. It will be an almost unprecedented chance to see an ancient private library as a collection. There are about 1,800 scrolls in the Herculaneum collection so even a small yield rate will be a treasure trove.



__Edit__ Thanks to [Guillermo López López](https://www.quora.com/profile/Guillermo-López-López) and [Gerhard Heinrichs](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gerhard-Heinrichs) who both pointed out the __[Archimedes Palimpsest](http://archimedespalimpsest.org/about/)__ __,__ a unique Greek mathematical text which was written over as a prayer book during the paper-starved Middle Ages and has been rendered readable by modern computer imaging. I had mistakenly thought that was a 21st century find, but the first results started appearing in 1998. Gerhard also caught the __[Nag Hammadi Library,](http://gnosis.org/naghamm/nhl.html)__  a collection of religious texts found in Egypt which includes a lot of invaluable material on early Christianity and Gnosticism and was discovered in the 70’s.
