# Why is it that Professor Andrew George adopts the spelling Utnapishti when all the other translators of the Gilgamesh materials into English appear to use Utnapishtim? Not arguing, just curious.

__The short version:__ 

The -m was optional in cuneiform.

__The long version:__ 

Originally, most Akkadian words whose final syllable used -a-, -u-, or -i- ended with -m. Over the centuries that terminal -m (technically known as a “[mimation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mimation)”) disappeared — so, you’ll usually find words with both mimated and non-mimated forms. Nowadays Akkadian words are often transcribed to indicate that the mimation is optional: In a dictionary rthe word for “king” is written _šarru(m)_ with the parentheses reminding the reader that the mimated ending may or may not be present.

In cuneiform the name of the man who survived the Flood is written with two characters, 𒌓𒍣 .

[𒌓](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%92%8C%93) was the Sumerian logogram for “sun” or “day.” In Akkadian it may mean the same or it may simply sound like the Sumerian word, which was _ud_ . Akkadian pronounced it _ut_  or _utu_ .

__[𒍣](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%92%8D%A3)__ ____ in Sumerian was _zid,_ which could mean either “life” or “throat” (since breath is the sign of life). In Akkadian cuneiform it can sound like _zi_ or _se —_ or for the Akkadian word meaning “life” or “breath”, which you’ll find in the dictionary as _[napištu(m)](https://www.assyrianlanguages.org/akkadian/dosearch.php)_ _._ Here the name is in the genitive case, which changes the noun ending from _-u(m)_  to _-i(m)_ . The whole will literally translate as something like “Day of life” or “Sun of life”. In the original Sumerian it was written 𒍣𒌓 𒋤𒁺, with the “Life” and “Sun” ideograms reversed followed by 𒋤𒁺 SUD Ra₂ (“distant” or perhaps “eternal”); the Akkadian version is sort of a half-calque.
