This varied a lot by region and culture, but several features were “set in stone” (so to speak) very early on.

__Recording.__ 

Treaties were essentially contracts, and usually contracts arranged between mutually suspicious parties. So they were recorded carefully with multiple copies that could be consulted in the future if a dispute arose. This goes way, way, back — the [earliest written treaty](http://www.duhaime.org/LawMuseum/LawArticle-1313/2550-BC--The-Treaty-of-Mesilim.aspx) settles a boundary dispute between the Sumerian cities of Umma and Lagash around 2550 BC It was originally inscribed on a stone monument but the version we have today is a copy made about a hundred years later.

Because of their importance treaties were often produced in impressive ways: the [”Eternal Peace”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%E2%80%93Hittite_peace_treaty) between the Egyptians and the Hittites was inscribed on silver tablets (~ 1274 BC). The earliest treaty between Rome and Carthage was inscribed on bronze tablets and displayed in a temple; the [Pyrgi Tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrgi_Tablets), recording another between Carthage and the Italian city of Caere, were gold.

__Language__ 

When multiple languages were involved, it was common to record treaties in both languages. The Hittite-Egyptian treaty is one example, the Pyrgi Tablets another. Nobody wanted to depend on a treaty written only in the other fellow’s language.

__Religious wrapping__ 

However hard-nosed the political background to a particular treaty, the gods were brought in as guarantors of the treaty. Most treaties were wrapped in the same legal formula as an oath — calling upon the gods to witness the “contract” and inviting divine punishment on whoever violated the terms of the agreement. The forms vary from place to place but most ancient diplomats would instantly get the gist of the Umma-Lagash treaty:

> "Let the man of Umma never cross the border of Ningirsu! Let him never damage the dyke or the ditch! Let him not move the stele! If he crosses the border, may the great net of Enlil, king of heaven and earth, by whom he has made oath, fall upon Umma!"

The public proclamation of the treaty was also a big part of the process. However the negotiations were done behind the scenes the public finale would be a public religious ceremony designed to advertise the new treaty both to this world and to the higher one. Mesopotamian treaties were usually sealed with the sacrifice of a donkey and a ritual anointing the participants (or their representatives) with the donkey’s blood. Greek treaties were sealed with both an animal sacrifice and ritual offering of wine (the [Greek word](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=spondh&la=greek#lexicon) for “treaty” is really the word for “drink offering”) . Roman treaties were overseen by a special college of priests, the [Fetiales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetial) — in rather Roman fashion we know far more about their ritual procedures for declaring war than we do about how they concluded peace.
