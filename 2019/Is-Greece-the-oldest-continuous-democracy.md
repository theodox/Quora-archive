No. Greek democracies came and went several times in antiquity. Some of them lasted several centuries, but all were eventually absorbed by either Greek kingdoms or the Roman empire. There were no democracies in the Greek world between the first century and the 19th.

The most famous democratic regime, in the city of Athens had its longest run of democratic self governance between 508 and 404 BC when the democracy was overthrown by a reactionary oligarchy. After about a year the democracy was restored, in a limited form which lasted until the year 338 BC, when Philip of Macedon (the father of Alexander the Great) defeated Athens and installed a friendly regime. Democratic institutions came and went a few more times at Athens, but never for long;

The most long-lived of the Greek democracies is actually the island of [Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes#Hellenistic_age), which first adopted democracy in the fourth century BC. There were some interruptions but as far as we can tell Rhodes retained its institutions from shortly after the death of Alexander the Great in 332 BC down until the 44 AD, when (having already been a self-governing part of the Roman empire for two centuries) it was incorporated into the Roman province of Asia.
