Given the nature of our evidence it’s actually kind of hard to pick a top ten list; with a spotty literary record and not a lot of reliable statistics, we are often going on secondhand reputations rather than hard evidence. With that caveat:

The number one spot obviously goes to __[Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria)__ __.__ The city’s wealth and literary reputation are both legendary — Alexandrian culture dominated the Mediterranean for almost a thousand years. Alexandria was probably the second largest city in the world (after Babylon) before the Roman conquest, and it remained the second largest city in the Roman empire down to the third century.

Number two is less famous, but in its heyday was almost as big, wealthy and important as Alexandria: __[Seleucia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucia)__ , the capital of the Seleucid Empire, was a vast and wealthy city. It survived the dynasty that created it and [remained a huge, wealthy city throughout the Parthian period.](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-Seleucia-the-ancient-capital-city-of-the-Seleucids/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=0d8cf88a&srid=zLvM) I

Number three is probably __[Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily)__ , which became the wealthiest city in the western Greek world. Syracuse was strong enough to beat an Athenian invasion at the height of Athenian power, and to hold off the Carthaginians through a couple of centuries of on-again-off-again warfare in Sicily and North Africa.

Number four is not usually listed as a colony, but __[Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miletus)__ was actually part of the Ionian settlement wave that happened during the Greek Dark Ages. Miletus was the intellectual and economic powerhouse of Greece before the arrival of the Persians; many of the most famous names in early Greek science and philosophy (Thales and Anaximander, to name a couple) are Milesians.

__[Cyrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrene,_Libya)__ ____ was one of the most long-lived colonies, but it was also very influential. It was through Cyrene that a lot of Egyptian ideas spread to Greece (the famous depiction of Alexander the Great with rams horns, masquerading as Amun, is based on Cyrenean going back more than a century before Alexander’s arrival). Cyrene remained an influential center of culture all the way up to the end of the Roman era.

__[Massilia](https://www.ancient.eu/massilia/)__ __,__ modern Marseille, was another very successful Greek colony. Massillia was never a military powerhouse — it never succeeded in expanding outside its own coastal enclave in the face of opposition from the local Gauls — but it was a very important link between Gallic areas and the Mediterranean. Massilia survived and prospered thanks to its alliance with Rome, which meant that it remained a successful entrepot into the imperial period.

__[Cumae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumae)__ near Naples was one of the most successful Greek colonies in Italy. In addition to founding other colonies of its own (above all Naples — but also in Sicily and, interestingly, in Achaea in mainland Greece) Cumae exported Greek ideas and Greek literacy to the various cultures of Italy: the Etruscans and the Latins both got their letters from Cumae.

__[Olbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbia_(archaeological_site))__ __,__ a Milesian colony at the mouth of the Bug river in the Ukraine, had a name which reflected its fortunes: “Olbia” means “prosperous”. As a focus for a variety of trade from the steppes the city was in period danger from local nomadic kingdoms but it also cleared vast quantities of gold, furs, grain and slaves.

It’s hard to pick numbers nine and ten; there are quite a few prosperous colonies that might make the list. I’d suggest a be a three-way tie between __[Byzantion,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantium)__  __[Chalcedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantium)__ ____ and __[Heraclea Pontica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclea_Pontica)__ __.__ All three were part of the Black Sea trade network, with the first two dominating the Bosporus and the third controlling a good chunk of the southern shore of the Black Sea. All three were prosperous and all three were often victims of their own success: their excellent positions made them good targets for military adventurers down the century. Of course if later significance were included then Byzantion, the future Constantinople, would of course rocket to the top of the list — but since this question is about the cities in their primes these three feel roughly similar at the top of the second tier.
