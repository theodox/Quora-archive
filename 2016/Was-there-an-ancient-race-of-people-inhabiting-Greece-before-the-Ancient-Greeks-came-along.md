The one-sentence answer is ‘yes, but”.

The ancient traditions on this are pretty confused and the archaeological evidence is only somewhat helpful. The old 19th century view of the Greeks sweeping down out of the north in a mass migration is very much out of fashion — but there’s not a clear, easily described model to put in its place.

Here’s a roundup of what we know. It’s heavily outweighed by what we _don’t_ know.

__Linguistics__ 

Greek is an Indo-European language, which connects it to languages as diverse as Sanskrit and German. The homeland of the the Indo-European family is [contested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_homeland); the most common guesses are Anatolia and the Central Asian Steppes — but the language ultimately stems from a distant source. The part we don’t know is _how_ distant in time and space. We are certain there were people in the Greek peninsula speaking a version of Greek as far back as 3,500 years ago: [Mycenaean](http://www.ancient.eu/Mycenaean_Civilization/) tablets from that time are written in a Greek dialect and include such familiar names as [Zeus, Poseidon, Hera and Athena](http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/mycen.html) as well as other common words. So, there were clearly Greeks in Greece (for a given value of both words) around the time when the [last Egyptian pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Ahmose) was built, and only about 500 years after the last mammoths died out on Wrangel Island.

On the other hand there have been people living in settled communities in Greece for at least the last__9,000__  years, which antedates the origins of the whole Indo-European language family by a couple of millenia. So clearly there were people in Greece before the first Greek or one-day-will-be-Greek speakers arrived. And they didn’t “arrive” speaking Greek: its generally thought nowadays that Greek evolved in the Greek peninsula itself. Based on linguistic evidence something recognizable as Proto-Greek emerged between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago, probably along the west coast of Greece and Albania — along side the ancestors of related languages like Illyrian and Thracian.

_[the Cycladic Culture](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ecyc/hd_ecyc.htm)_ _was flourishing in the Aegean before proto-Greek emerged as a distinctive language in the west of the peninsula._ 

__Literary sources__ 

In historic times Greek tradition generally acknowledged that there were “others” in the area before the Greeks. Unfortunately that tradition is messy and contradictory. The most well-known of “pre-Greeks” are the [Pelasgians](https://linguistics.osu.edu/herodotos/ethnonym/european/pelasgians). The usual quote is from Herodotus

> _the chief peoples were the Lacedaemonians among those of Doric, and the Athenians among those of Ionic stock. These races, Ionian and Dorian, were the foremost in ancient time, the first a Pelasgian and the second a Hellenic people. The Pelasgian race has never yet left its home; the Hellenic has wandered often and far._ 

In this version, at least, Ionic part of the Greek world derives at least in part from Pelasgian stock where the Doric component (most notably the leading Doric states: Sparta, Corinth, Thebes and Crete) essentially invaders.

_Some of the many places the Later Greeks tagged as ‘Pelasgian’_ 

In the 19th century this kind of statement was taken as evidence of a [Dorian invasion](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dorian_invasion), in which Dorian Greeks pushed down out of the north and dispossessed the original inhabitants. Greek writers sometimes speak of the Pelasgians (and other vaguely defined groups, like the [Minyans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minyans) or the [Tyrrhenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrhenians)) as ‘others’ and sometimes as if they were part of the Greek world. Herodotus quite clearly says that

_the Athenians, who were certainly Pelasgi, must have changed their language at the same time that they passed into the Hellenic body._ 

which strongly suggests that the boundaries between Greek and non-Greek could be quite porous. The Athenians were quite proud of their autochthonous roots and affected to look down on their Dorian neightbors as parvenus, but it’s hard to dispute that the Athenians are Greeks.

So, we don’t really know how the one-day-to-be-Greeks and related to the other peoples around then. Some aspects of Greek religion have obvious parallels in, say, Vedic India (Zeus has the same name as [Dyáus Pitā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyaus_Pita) in the Rig Veda) but others are unique: are they local borrowings or simply Greek inventions? Many Greek place names have non-Indo-European roots (names ending in _-assos_  or _-inthos,_ like Corinth or Herodotus’ home town of Halicarnassos) which could be consistent with conquest — or with non-Greeks gradually adopting Greek language and culture. We don’t really know and it’s not clear that the story was the same everywhere.

__Archaeology__ 

It’s very easy for us —with several centuries of nation-states, brightly coloured maps, and one-paragraph histories of entire millennia to color our judgement — to forget how incredibly localized and fragmented the ancient world could be. Mycenae, the mightiest and most famous of the early Greek settlements probably had a population of less than 30,000 at its peak. The Mycenaean kingdom of Pylos covered about 2,000 square kilometers with a population of 50,000 people (if we can believe their records). That’s about the same population density as modern Sudan, which is mostly empty desert. So there was plenty of room for Greek and non-Greek ( however called) to live side by side in many different ways ranging from conquest and enslavement to simple coexistence to peaceful assimilation.

That range of options can work the other way too: there are lots of Greek traditions that imply that non-Greeks helps found or settle many of the oldest Greek sites: Argos was legendarily founded by the Egyptian [Danaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danaus), Thebes by the Phoenician [Cadmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmus), and the Cyclades colonized the Cretans under [Minos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos). The DNA evidence does not support large scale colonization from across the Mediterranean but there’s no reason to think think that a small number of emigres (particularly those from wealthier, more sophisticated places) couldn’t have a big impact on the culture and politics of such small places.

And of course our sources (terribly limited as they are) won’t always distinguish between, say, a Greek ruling class lording it over a non-Greek peasantry, a Greek peasantry ruled by a dynasty of foreigners and a Greek-speaking community of mixed ancestry. There are probably examples of all of these, we just lack the tools to tell them apart.

That welter of options helps explain why the archaeology doesn’t help disentangle things much. There is _some_  clear physical continuity between those Myceneans and earlier inhabitants of the peninsula - and some evidence of disruptive change. In pottery, for example, there is overlap between clearly Mycenaean work and earlier pieces (the so-called “[Helladic](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prehistory/aegean/?page_id=670)” culture or cultures). However there are also notable differences. Unfortunately this makes judgement s about demographic continuity rather dicey: it’s not easy to tell from a potsherd or a foundation stone whether a transition in styles is forcible or peaceful, driven by domestic needs or imposed by alien overlords — and it’s not obvious that the destruction by fire of one town means that cultural developments 50 miles away were dictated by violence.

__TLDR:__ 

The indisputable ‘hard evidence’ for Greeks in Greece goes back to the Mycenaeans, and shades off imperceptibly between, say, 1500 and 3000 BC, or possibly even a thousand years before that. There were definitely non-Greek people in the peninsula before anyone recognizable as a “Greek” arrived, but we have only mute archaeological evidence for who they were. In some places those older groups survived into historic times as communities (Herodotus and Thucydides both mention Pelasgian communities in the north Aegean in their own days). Elsewhere the Hellenes and the autochthons merged in a variety of ways: even those arch-Greeks the Athenians were also descendants of the neolithic inhabitants of the region.

Maybe the biggest takeaway is that the 19th century model of ‘invasion’ is too simple: the boundaries between Greek and non-Greek were more fluid, and the ways they interacted more complex, than people imagined in the days of Bismarck and Nietzsche.
