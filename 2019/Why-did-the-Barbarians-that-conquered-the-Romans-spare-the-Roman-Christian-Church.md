Well, for the most part the invaders weren’t a bunch of fur-clad crazies howling out of the dim mists of the north. Most of the people who actually entered Roman territories were already more than half-Romanized.

Many, in fact, were already Christians.

To pick the most obvious example, consider the career of [Alaric,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_I) the Goth who sacked Rome in 410. His full title at the time of the sack was _magister militum per Illyricum_  — he was nominally, at least, a Roman general. When he died shortly after the sack, he’d acquired the even higher Roman title of _magister utriusque militae;_ he was on paper the highest ranking Roman officer in the west. He’d been a Roman hero at the [Battle of the Frigidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Frigidus), where he fought shoulder to shoulder with the eastern emperor against the Roman usurper and suspected pagan sympathizer [Eugenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenius). Eugenius’ own chief of staff, [Arbogast,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbogast_(general)) was a Frank; the second in command of the eastern forces, [Gainas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainas), was another Goth. The emperor Alaric fought for, Theodosius, had a [Frankish daughter-in-law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aelia_Eudoxia) who issued coins in her own name and was, in her day, regarded as the real ruler of the east. Alaric’s arch-nemesis, the western military’s high commander [Stilicho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho), was the son of a Vandal and had also married into the imperial household.

In short, the line between “Roman” and “Barbarian” was often pretty fuzzy.

To round out the example, Alaric himself was also at least nominally a Christian. The Goths in general had absorbed influences from the Roman Christian world. As often happened, ideas crossed the border in a number of ways. [Ulfilas,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulfilas) the evangelist of the Goths, was born a Greek but raised in slavery by the Goths, so he was fluent in their language — he created an alphabet for them in order to give them their own Bible in the mid-fourth century. A bit later the Gothic chieftain [Fritigern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritigern) seems to have encouraged conversions in part because this helped the process of political accommodation with the Romans. Fritigern’s rival [Athanaric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanaric), on the other hand, persecuted Christians among the Goths. It’s impossible to know, at this distance, whether their respective theological positions would have been reversed if the political situation had been different.

Ironically the key religious distinction between the Goths in particular and the Romans was actually an abstruse intra-Christian theological controversy: Ulfilas and Fritigern and most other Goths embraced [Arianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism), a variant Christian doctrine which differed in some details from the orthodox teachings of Rome and (most of the time) Constantinople. Even here, this indicates a significant degree of cross-border cultural exchange, since the Goths (and other groups, particularly the Vandals and the Alans) were embroiled an eminently Roman theological spat which had partisans everywhere from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. This controversy had serious consequences, however, since particularly in Spain and North Africa barbarians with Arian leanings had unhealthy relations with their orthodox subjects. The bad reputation that the Vandals still maintain today stems in large part from the way they alienated their civilian populations.

On the other hand barbarian groups who embraced orthodox theology — particularly the Franks and the Suebi — found it easier to cooperate with their Roman counterparts. It’s impossible to know (especially since most of the written record comes from orthodox churchmen) the balance of personal and political in these relationships; even in our limited sources we do see things like mixed marriages on one hand, and bitter partisanship on the other.

There were of course several barbarian groupings which never adopted Christianity. The most notorious example was [Radagaisus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radagaisus) a pagan Goth who organized a large-scale invasion of Italy in 405. By reputation, anyway — naturally we have only the other side of the story — he was a fanatic who planned on sacrificing the the entire Roman senate and burning Rome down around their bodies. However he was defeated by the half-Vandal general Stilicho, with assistance from Goths and Huns. The Alamanni and particularly the Saxons who invaded Britain had a reputation for anti-Christian animus.

However, it’s a mistake to imagine this was a primary motivation for most of the invading groups, and the fate of Radagaisus gives a clue as to why. The Romans had a long history of cutting deals with barbarian groups who were willing to become part of the Roman security system — but there’s no way to cut a deal with somebody who’s eager to cut your throat. Many a barbarian warlord was both for and against the Romans, often more than once; it wasn’t necessarily principled, but flexibility was a key survival tactic in the war-torn years of the fifth and sixth centuries. Almost every barbarian group in Roman territory found ways to make accommodations with the existing military and civilian power structures.

Beside military resistance there was also civilian cooperation. The difference between the raids which had always plagued the Roman frontiers and the age of invasions (from 405 on) was that the invaders came to _stay_ . That required new skills: warrior bands — even those with a long connection to the Roman military — rarely had the skills to administer a civilian economy. One of the big stories of the sixth century is the creation of written law codes in the barbarian kingdoms — the [Lex Burgundionum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Burgundionum) of the Burgunds, the [Code of Leovigild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Leovigild) in Visigothic Spain, the [Edictum Theodorici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edictum_Theodorici) in Italy, the Frankish [Salic law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salic_law) and so on.

_A page of the Salic Law, committed to writing in the early sixth century. Even though it codifies Frankish law, it’s written in Latin._ 

The creation and maintenance of these systems required literate administrators, who tended to come from the existing Roman elites, and particularly from the clergy. A lucky barbarian king would find a collaborator like [Cassiodorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiodorus) or [Avitus of Vienne.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitus_of_Vienne) Conversely, barbarian leaders who were too antagonistic to the existing Roman structures accelerated the economic decay of their own kingdoms: it’s not a coincidence that Britain, under its aggressively pagan Saxon leaders lost its urbanism, literacy, and romance language more completely than the rest of the western empire.

So to make a long story short: when the barbarians behaved like stereotypical “barbarians”, resistance was stiffer and the rewards of conquest were less. Ideological passions — pagan or Arian or simply anti-Roman — were costly indulgences. The most successful barbarian leaders avoided them. Those who failed to find accommodations (like the Saxons in England, or the Vandals in North Africa) impoverished their new conquests and undermined their power bases. Over time it was simply easier for the rulers to adopt the coloring of the ruled. By the end of the sixth century every major barbarian state in the old Roman territories, apart from the Saxon kingdoms of Britain, was Christian. By the end of the seventh century, they had all adopted orthodox theology and the medieval synthesis of Roman and Barbarian was well underway.
