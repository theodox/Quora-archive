I can't really say how this plays out world wide. In the US, I'd say, in order of job availability.


LA

San Francisco

Seattle

Austin 

New York


However there is a big difference depending on specializations. LA hosts both film/tv/vfx production and games. SF and Seattle have less film/vfx but more games work ; Austin has regional TV/VFX (less big-name national stuff) and games; NYC has mostly TV/VFX production.

In Canada, Montreal and Vancouver are the powerhouses with Toronto a distant third. 

You may find [ VFXworldmap.com](http://vfxworldmap.com/and) and [gamedevmap.com](http://www.gamedevmap.com/) useful (though look closely at the categories in the later - it lists companies, not numbers of companies so it overstates the reach of the business in areas with lots of tiny, low-margin mobile studios and understates big centers like LA , SF and Seattle.
