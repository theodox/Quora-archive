Byzantium (actually Βυζάντιον, _Byzántion_ in Greek) is the _city._ The empire was never officially known as “Byzantine,” — it was, in the eyes of its emperors and people, simply the Roman empire. The city [was renamed Constantinopolis when Constantine made it the seat of his government in the year 330](https://www.quora.com/What-was-Constantinople-called-before), though most Greek speakers knew about it’s old name… just as plenty of New Yorkers know that “old New York was once New Amsterdam”.

The name “Byzantine empire” was a term coined first by German historians in the sixteenth century, well after Constantinople had fallen to the Turks. It was popularized by European scholars who were ideologically or aesthetically attracted to the Rome of Caesar and Cicero but not the New Rome of the Greek-speaking, orthodox, and “byzantine” East Roman Empire.
