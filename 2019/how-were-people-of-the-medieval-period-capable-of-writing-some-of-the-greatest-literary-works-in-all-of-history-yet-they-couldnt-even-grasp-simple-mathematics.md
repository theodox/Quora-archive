# How were people of the medieval period capable of writing some of the greatest literary works in all of history yet they couldn't even grasp simple mathematics?

The idea that the medieval world was completely innumerate is incorrect.

The early middle ages (say, 600- 900) were a lot _poorer_  than the Roman period — politically fragmented, less populous, and less prosperous. However before the turn of the millennium there was big upswing in both economic and intellectual activity, and mathematics was an important part of that.

Among the highlights are:

the mathematician-pope [Sylvester II](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Gerbert.html), who helped popularize the use of Arabic numerals in Europe at the end of the 10th century.

the Fibonacci Sequence (beloved of computer science courses everywhere), studied by [Leonardo Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci) ( 1170–1240)

the game of [Rithmomachy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rithmomachy) — a sort of mathematical chess game which started off as a teaching aid but became a popular pastime after about the 1030’s.

the works of [Nicolas Oresme](http://www.homeofbob.com/science/teacherTools/graphing/info.html), the father of the modern graph

Musical theory was heavily influenced by mathematics — for example the works of mathematician/composer [Johannes de Muris ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_de_Muris)in the early 1300’s.

_A Rithomancy board - a more complex game than chess, where captures could be made geometrically (by surrounding pieces) or arithmetically (based on comparisons of value). Notice how the point values on the different sizes aren’t symmetrical._ 

On a purely practical level all of this took place during the growth of complex pan-European banking systems, starting in Italy but spreading as far abroad as Scotland, the Black Sea, the Middle East and China by the late 1300’s.

The twelfth century also saw an explosion of interest in mathematical texts translated from Arabic and Greek — this was the era when many half-remembered ideas from Euclid or Ptolemy were recovered and became current again.

… And that’s all before things like [Luca Pacioli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Pacioli) pioneering the principles of modern accounting in the late 1400s, and [Leon Battista Alberti ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Battista_Alberti)establishing the mathematics of perspective around the same time.

All that said, medieval mathematical attainment was not evenly distributed The mass of ordinary people were semi-literate at best, and their math skills were limited to practical necessities. Most educated people learned what math they knew from an [abacus school ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus_school)which focused on practical calculation (they didn’t necessarily use abacuses in preference to paper — though a skilled abacus user is often faster than a paper pusher). But certainly by 1250 or so educated people were as likely to be numerate as their Greek and Roman predecessors had been.

And, in the universities, mathematical speculation and theory were gaining strength. The medieval university curriculum had seven major subjects — the introductory three were grammar, logic, and rhetoric but the “advanced” four subjects were arithmetic or number theory, geometry, music (a subdivision of mathematics, concerned with ratios and proportions), and astronomy — a set of studies known as the [Quadrivium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium) and understood to be all fundamentally mathematical.

Therefore, well educated people regarded numeracy very highly: this is visible in the popularity of number games in medieval literature. Dante’s _Inferno_ , to take an obvious example, is full of number games (Galileo himself said “Dante, our sublime choreographer and architect, thought in rigorously geometrical terms” and wrote articles on the conic sections which defined Dante’s Hell).
