The Saxons were far from the biggest problems in the 5th century, and the legions weren’t “withdrawn”. They left for reasons that had little to do with grand strategy.

At the end of the fourth century two different commanders of the British legions had tried to seize the imperial throne. [Magnus Maximus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus) (383–388) and [Constantine III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_III_(Western_Roman_Emperor)) ( 407–411) both tried to use Britain as a secure base from which to launch their bids for the empire From a purely strategic perspective it was a good choice — compared to any other province with a substantial military presence, Britain was relatively safe from both Roman and barbarian threats. It’s also possible that this propensity to revolt reflected disaffection among the Romano-British elite, though we don’t really have much insight into that aspect.

So, the legions were not withdrawn by an uncaring central government: they left the island with Maximus and Constantine to fight _against_  the central government, and when they were defeated they were not replaced. The Saxon raids (particularly of 408–9) happened while he formerly British legions were embroiled in a complex war in Hispania against their own general, the former-rebel-turned-co-emperor Constantine III.

Even if the empire had been completely committed to a last-ditch defense of Britain, there was no help to send. The [infamous letter from Honorius ](https://www.romanarmytalk.com/rat/archive/index.php/thread-16770.html)to the Britons, telling them to look to their own defenses, was written* [in the same year that the Goths sacked the city of Rome itself.](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging) Constantine III was fighting against some of his own units and a variety of barbarians who has crossed the Rhine into Gaul. And the Britons themselves were restive — perhaps because of the Saxon raids, but perhaps also because they perceived a power vacuum: as the imperial historian Zosimus wrote, “they rejected Roman law, reverted to their native customs, and armed themselves to ensure their own safety.”

_This page from the_ [Notitia Dignitarum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notitia_Dignitatum)_lists the commands of the_ [Comes Litoris Saxonici,](http://lukeuedasarson.com/ComesLitorisSaxonici.html)_the “count of the Saxon Shore” concerned with protecting Britain for seaborne threats. The map has east (not north) at the top, and lists garrisons clockwise from Rutupis (Richborough) at left through Dubris (Dover) at top to Portus Adurni (Portchester) at right. It shows that even in the 420s the Roman’s still_ thought_they were defending Britaim._ 

It’s also important to remember that the ‘withdrawal’ was not like the last days of Saigon — there were still Roman troops in Britain when Magnus and Constantine marched off to the continent. Late-Roman legions were actually only a part of the military — most men under arms were border-guards and garrison troops, the _[limitanei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitanei)_ — as there were members of the mobile field-forces, the _[comitatenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comitatenses)_ _._ The Empire really could not ‘withdraw’ the _limitanei_ , who were more like a local militia than full-time professionals. The garrisons listed in the _Notitia Dignitatum,_ a 5th-century inventory of Roman forces, are mostly _limitanei._ Some units of mobile _comitatenses_ are still listed as stationed in Britain, though that’s purely wishful thinking.

Things stabilized a little after the crisis of 410 — but not enough for Britain to be a serious concern. The Saxons were small fry [when the western empire fought its last great war](https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chalons-attila-the-hun-versus-flavius-aetius.htm), defeating Attila the Hun at the Catalaunian Plains in 451. Meanwhile[ the Vandals had conquered the vital heartland of Roman Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandal_Kingdom) (in 435), cutting off the grain supplies without which Rome could not feed itself. Two failed efforts to dislodge the Vandals exhausted the fragile empire’s remaining strength and sealed its fate.

So: Britain was hardly “abandoned” in the way that, say, Hadrian abandoned Roman conquests in Mesopotamia or the way Tiberius contracted the frontier in Germany. The troops left to fight other Romans, and then were drawn into the maelstrom of the fifth-century collapse.



* There are some scholars who think the whole thing is a scribal error, and that the emperor was writing to _Bruttium_  in southern Italy instead of _Britannia._
