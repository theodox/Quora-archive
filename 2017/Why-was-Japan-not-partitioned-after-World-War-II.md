It actually _was,_ although the territories which were occupied by the Soviets were not central to what we think of today as ‘Japan’. But according to the logic of, say, 1939 a lot of “Japan” ended up under Russian occupation or was reassigned to Russian satellites.

Here’s a map of the Japanese empire in 1939 (so, not counting the Phillipines or former British, French and Dutch possessions):

Here’s what’s left by the Korean war:

On a strictly land-area basis, the bulk of the former imperial territories ended up in ‘Red’ hands.

The Soviets invaded Manchuria in 1945. The Japanese armies there fell apart rapidly and the Soviets quickly established control. However China itself — nominally an ally of the Soviets — was in a highly chaotic state, and although the Russians left in 1946, nominally returning the area to Chinese sovereignty, they in fact handed Manchuria over to Mao’s communists and not to the Nationalist government.

The Russians also established control of northern Korea in 1945. Here there was a familiar ‘partition’ along the 38th parallel, with Americans landing in September to meet meet the Russians who were already there.

The Russians also took part of the Japanese home islands, or at least islands that the Japanese regarded as part of their natural boundaries. The Japanese gave up their claim to [Sakhalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakhalin) (the island in the top map neatly divided in half) in 1952, but the southern [Kuril Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuril_Islands) (marked on the map above) [remain disputed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuril_Islands_dispute) today. In fact Japan and Russia have never signed a peace treaty formally ending the Second World War.
