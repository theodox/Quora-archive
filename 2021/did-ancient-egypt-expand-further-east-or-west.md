Egypt’s greatest territorial expansion was more north-south than east-west; under [Thotmose III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_III), whose reign marks the territorial high-water mark for Egyptian power, the armies of the Nile reached as far north as modern Turkey and as far south as the fourth cataract of the Nile (modern [Jebel Barka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Barkal)). To go north, of course, the Egyptians had to follow the arc of the Mediterranean coast through modern Israel, Lebanon and Syria but their focus was always up the trade routes which lead towards the headwaters of the Euphrates, not east.

This map (in German) gives a more accurate idea of the real shape of Thutmose’s empire than many competing examples: for most if its length, Egypt proper was really only a couple of days’ march across. If you compare it with this striking nighttime image, which gives you a good sense for where people live today, you can see the logic in their choices:

As noted in [this answer](https://www.quora.com/How-was-ancient-Egypt-protected-from-invasion-by-natural-barriers/answer/Steve-Theodore), Egypt really only has three “exits” — the valley of the Nile and the coast to the immediate east or west of the Delta. The rest is desert which, while not totally impassable, does not repay the effort needed to march an army through (the climate was somewhat kinder in remote antiquity — but it was not a very hospitable place in historic times). Even in World War II, the fights on Egypt’s western flank rarely extended more than a few score miles from the sea.

Since Egypt already possessed the fantastically fertile Nile valley, the appeal of extra land to the east and west was never very strong. To the south there was Nubia, with gold, iron and ivory. To the north were both populous areas to tax and — particularly prized in timber-starved Egypt — the forest of Lebanon. But to the east and west? Not much worth having, although the Sinai Peninsula did have copper and gem mines which were exploited (often under appalling conditions) for most of Egyptian history.
