Those aren't all Egyptian, although members of those groups could all be found in Egypt.

I'm not familiar with the particular piece but if it follows standard Egyptian conventions they are, from left to right, a Libyan , a Nubian, somebody from Levant (A Canaanite, a Phoenician, or maybe a Carian) and last a Egyptian. At different times you could find all of those groups in Egypt, and at one point or another all of those groups provided Pharaohs (whom, however, Egyptian tradition disdainfully records as usurpers). However if you'd asked an Egyptian, they'd tell you that the only Egyptian figure in the group is the one on the right -- the rest are "foreigners."

The Egyptians interacted with lots of different groups but they were pretty ethnocentric and didn't always draw fine distinctions between them; for example they usually lumped anybody north of Cyprus together as 'the islanders'. They usually did go out of their way to depict foreigners and Egyptians differently, however.
