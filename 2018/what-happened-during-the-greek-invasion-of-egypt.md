The Greeks — more precisely, the Macedonians under Alexander — were welcomed by native Egyptians because they overthrew a much-hated Persian occupation.

__Background__ 

Egypt was first conquered by the Persians two hundred years before, but the occupation had never been well liked. Three generations before Alexander, in 404 BC, the Egyptians had risen against the Persians — taking advantage of the Persian preoccupation with the Peloponnesian war in Greece.

While Persian affairs were disordered by wars in Greece and rebellions in other parts of the Persian empire, the Egyptians maintained their independence. However the respite did not last. Once the Persians had rebuilt their army, hobbled the Greeks, and quashed the rebellious provinces they returned to Egypt. In 343 they finally defeated [Nectanebo II,](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/nectanebo-ii/) the last native Egyptian to sit on the throne of the Pharaohs.

__Alexander__ 

[When Alexander arrived in 332,](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Anabasis_of_Alexander/Book_III/Chapter_I) the Egyptians were overjoyed to see the Persians displaced. Alexander’s “conquest” of Egypt was more like a triumphal procession than an invasion. The Persian governor, Mazaces, knew that Alexander had defeated the main Persian army (including much of the Egyptian garrison) in two pitched battles already. He also knew that the Great King was a thousand miles away, trying to rebuild his forces. He surrendered without a fight. As Alexander progressed through the country every city opened its gates to him enthusiastically.

Alexander was very canny in his approach to the Egyptians. He traveled up the Nile to Memphis and made a lavish sacrifice to the Apis Bull — not just an important aspect of Egyptian belief, but also a pointed reminder of the fact that [the first Persian conqueror of Egypt was said to have sacrilegiously slain the sacred bull ](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cambyses-opers)in his day. But he didn’t stop there. After he picked the site for the future city of Alexandria, he led a pilgrimage to the oracle of [Amun](http://www.livius.org/articles/place/ammon-siwa/ammon-deity/) in the oasis of Siwa — the most prestigious holy site in Egypt, and one that had been particularly favored by Nectanebo during his reign.

Alexander conferred with the priests of the shrine and emerged with a powerful endorsement: they pronounced him a living god, the son of Amun. Whether Alexander believed this or not, [it was a brilliant piece of political theate](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised/answer/Steve-Theodore)r: it placed him in the religious role of a divine Pharoah, with the endorsement of the priestly hierarchy, and also positioned him as the political heir of the defeated Nectanebo.

__Aftermath__ 

Egyptian enthusiasm for Alexander outlived his empire. In later times a legend circulated that Alexander’s real father was Nectanebo, who had magically assumed the form of a serpent and lain with Alexander’s mother Olympias — an Egyptian nationalist way of appropriating Alexander’s conquest of Persia.

When Alexander died in Babylon, ten years after his visit to Siwa, his general [Ptolemy Soter](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/ptolemy-i-soter/) kidnapped his body and brought it to the new city of Alexandria. Alexander was entombed with pharaonic magnificence in a golden sarcophagus, and Ptolemy ruled as his successor. He continued Alexander’s policy of[ favoring the Egyptian temples and paying court to Egyptian sensibilities](https://www.quora.com/What-religion-did-the-Ptolemaic-dynasty-of-Egypt-follow/answer/Steve-Theodore) — though Egyptians were largely excluded from government and the army.

The Ptolemaic dynasty held power for another three centuries by combining a veneer of Egyptian belief and by tying their prestige to the religious aura surrounding Alexander’s memory. Ten generations later Cleopatra would be the last Macedonian queen of Egypt and the mantle of the Pharaohs would pass to the Roman emperors.
