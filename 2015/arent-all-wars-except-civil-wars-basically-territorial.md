Plenty of wars are fought to force political or strategic realignments rather than simply to acquire territory. The biggest wars of recent times, in Afghanistan and Iraq, are good examples of wars fought to change regimes or political arrangements, rather than to expand national boundaries. Wars of this sort are historically quite common; even the Romans, for example, usually resorted to annexation as a last resort: they defeated Macedonia, for example, 4 separate times in 150 years before finally turning it into a province; they even tried to turn Carthage into a client state before destroying it and, much later, re-settling it themselves. Plenty of modern wars have the same goal: to force one state to abide by the wishes of another without a change of borders.

Territorial conquest is frequently very expensive, and often counterproductive. It works reasonably well in societies where the bulk of the population isn't particularly attached to their rulers: you can swap out the king and a few of the most powerful nobles while the peasants can hardly tell the difference. But once the average person feels a certain degree of investment in their own governance and public life, this become much harder. If the new rulers are culturally or linguistically distinct it's very hard indeed -- particularly now in an era where small numbers of motivated fighters can sew so much disruption, and where the cost of fighting an insurgency are so much higher than the costs of running one.
