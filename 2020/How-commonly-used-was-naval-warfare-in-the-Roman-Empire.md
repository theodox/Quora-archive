Over the long stretch of Roman history there are two big ups and downs.

It’s famous that the Romans were originally landlubbers. The historian Polybius quotes a treaty between Rome and Carthage, which he says dates to the earliest years of the republic, which effectively grants Carthage the freedom of the seas in the western Mediterranean. When the Romans and Carthaginians finally squared off in the [First Punic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Punic_War) (begun 264 BC) the Romans had to improvise a fleet more or less from scratch, using capture Carthaginian ships as templates.

From that period until the battle of [Actium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium) in 31 BC, Roman fleets operated all over the Mediterranean. Actium was the biggest naval battle in Roman history — but it was part of a Roman civil war between soon-to-be-emperor Augustus and the allied forces of Marc Antony and Cleopatra. However Actium ensured that the Mediterranean would be a Roman lake for a long time to come.

During the heyday of the empire the Romans did maintained a fleet, primarily for the suppression of piracy, but it was not on the scale of the war fleets of earlier times. We have a pretty complete record of the two main Roman squadrons in the early empire and between them they total only a bit over a hundred ships — the two sides at Actium had fielded around 750. There were also smaller fleets in the Black Sea, on the Rhine river, and in the English Channel. Mostly these handled coast guard, anti-piracy, and customs duty rather than fighting sea battles.

During the eruption the Roman naturalist Pliny was the admiral of the fleet — an honorary post, since there were no serious naval threats. He died leading the fleet to evacuate survivors of the eruption._ 

Naval warfare returned to the Mediterranean in the 430’s, when the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals) invaded the western empire. They crossed from Spain to North Africa, the agricultural heart of the western empire and established a kind of pirate kingdom there, raiding all over the Mediterranean; in Old English the Mediterranean is the [Wendelsæ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wendels%C3%A6#Old_English), the “Vandal sea”. The waning Roman empire tried to organize a naval response; at the [Battle of Cape Bon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_Bon_(468)) in 468 the squabbling halves of the empire united their fleets to try to destroy the Vandals — the fleet was the largest assembly of ships in Roman history, probably eleven hundred or so vessels, though smaller and lighter than the ships which fought at Actium. The Vandals, however launched an attack by fireships during peace talks, and the expedition ended in disaster. This fiasco spelt doom for the western half of the empire, which never recovered.

The eastern half of the empire recovered its naval power gradually. In the sixth century East Roman fleets recaptured North Africa, Sicily, and parts of Spain. But the rise of the Arab empire in the seventh century turned the eastern Mediterranean into the scene of endemic naval warfare — there would be centuries of conflict until the fourth crusade really broke the Byzantine naval tradition.
