They were never entirely forgotten, but they were also not well known. There was a distinct break around the beginning of the Roman era, when even tenuous communications were largely lost — there are far more mentions of events in India and Bactria before the beginning of our era than afterwards. This reflects the rise of the Parthian empire, which cut the natural lines of communication between the Greek East and the Mediterranean world.

The conquest of the old Greek realms by the [Kushans ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushan_Empire)in the first century did not completely extinguish Greek culture in the east — but the Kushans never appear under their own name in Greco-Roman sources. If it were not for archaeology we would never have guessed that Greek literacy and some Greek religious forms lived on in the Indus Valley and Bactria into at least the third century — even though the presence of Roman coins and artifacts shows that some level of contact was ongoing.

It’s sadly telling that most of what we know about this sequence of Greco-Bactrian, Indo-Greek, and Kushan kingdoms comes from coins, rather than texts. The numismatic evidence has allowed us to get a rough sense the sequence and relative fortunes of many Indo-Greek kings whose name would otherwise be unknown to us.

Below: a less impressive but historically important coin of Hermaios , in Greek and Kharosthi— a contemporary of emperor Augustus and the last of the known Indo-Greek kings.

_A coin of the Kushan emperor Kanishka, with a Greek legend and and image of Helios, the sun. This is roughly contemporary with Hadrian in the west — but you’d never find a mention in our textual sources. Photo:_ _[CoinIndia](http://www.coinindia.com/galleries-kanishka.html)_ 

Better information was once available. A good example of what we’ve lost is the [Parthica of Apollodorus](https://iranicaonline.org/articles/apollodorus-of-artimita-historian), a Greek writer who was a Parthian subject from what is today [Mazandaran province in Iran](http://en.umz.ac.ir/index.aspx?pageid=3005). Apollodorus is the source for many of the more reliable factoids about Bactria, northern India, and the Eurasian steppes that were current around the beginning of the Roman era. Bits and pieces of his works show up in standard works like [Strabo](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/11K*.html) (XI.11):

> The Greeks who caused Bactria to revolt grew so powerful on account of the fertility of the country that they became masters, not only of Ariana, but also of India, as Apollodorus of Artemita says: and more tribes were subdued by them than by Alexander — by Menander in particular (at least if he actually crossed the Hypanis towards the east and advanced as far as the Imaüs), for some were subdued by him personally and others by Demetrius, the son of Euthydemus the king of the Bactrians; and they took possession, not only of Patalena, but also, on the rest of the coast, of what is called the kingdom of Saraostus and Sigerdis. In short, Apollodorus says that Bactriana is the ornament of Ariana as a whole; and, more than that, they extended their empire even as far as the Seres and the Phryni.

Unfortunately for us, Apollodorus’ work survives only in quotations and paraphrases.

Apart from Apollodorus and other Partho-Greeks like [Isidore of Charax,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Charax) good information was not in great supply. Roman era writers clearly recycle a lot of material from the era of Alexander and the early Seleucids, not always with the most judicious distinctions between fact and fancy.

Nonetheless, the perennial interest in Alexander’s adventures kept alive the memory of his foundations and their fate. So even in the Latin-speaking west, many a monastery library would have contained a copy of Justin’s [Phillipic History](http://www.attalus.org/info/justinus.html), which included a few lines about the Bactrian breakaway from the Seleucid empire

> At the same period, also, Theodotus, governor of the thousand cities of Bactria, revolted, and assumed the title of king; and all the other people of the east, influenced by his example, fell away from the Macedonians. One Arsaces, a man of uncertain origin, but of undisputed bravery, happened to arise at this time; and he, who was accustomed to live by plunder and depredations, hearing a report that Seleucus was overcome by the Gauls in Asia, and being consequently freed from dread of that prince, invaded Parthia with a band of marauders, overthrew Andragoras the governor, and, after putting him to death, took upon himself the government of the country. Not long after, too, he made himself master of Hyrcania, and thus, invested with authority over two nations, raised a large army, through fear of Seleucus and Theodotus, king of the Bactrians. But being soon relieved of his fears by the death of Theodotus, he made peace and an alliance with his son, who was also named Theodotus; and not long after, engaging with king Seleucus, who came to take vengeance on the rebels, he obtained a victory; and the Parthians observe the day on which it was gained with great solemnity, as the date of the commencement of their liberty.

[Justin 41.4](http://www.attalus.org/translate/justin7.html#41.4)

and the subsequent shift of Greek power in the east from Bactria to India

> Almost at the same time that Mithridates ascended the throne among the Parthians, Eucratides began to reign among the Bactrians; both of them being great men. But the fortune of the Parthians, being the more successful, raised them, under this prince, to the highest degree of power; while the Bactrians, harassed with various wars, lost not only their dominions, but their liberty; for having suffered from contentions with the Sogdians, the Arachosians, the Drancae, the Arei and the Indians, they were at last overcome, as if exhausted, by the weaker Parthians. Eucratides, however, carried on several wars with great spirit, and though much reduced by his losses in them, yet, when he was besieged by Demetrius king of the Indians [= [Demetrius III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_III_Aniketos)], with a garrison of only three hundred soldiers, he repulsed, by continual sallies, a force of sixty thousand enemies. Having accordingly escaped, after a five months' siege, he reduced India under his power. But as he was returning from the country, he was killed on his march by his son, with whom he had shared his throne, and who was so far from concealing the murder, that, as if he had killed an enemy, and not his father, he drove his chariot through his blood, and ordered his body to be cast out unburied.
