in any case the walls - there were similar systems in many places of the empire - were not intended as a hermetic seal around Roman territory, but as a method of limiting potential opponent's mobility and delaying them until mobile field forces could bring them to battle. 

Rome never had anything like the manpower to actually man the walls (the "_limes"_ or "borders") very thickly; however fixed fortifications were a good way to deter casual raiding and to slow the movement of serious threats. The real purposes were strategic - preventing major surprises and providing reaction time - rather than the tactical purpose of physically excluding enemies.
