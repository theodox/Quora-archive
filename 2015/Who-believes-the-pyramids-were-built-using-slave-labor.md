It's not clear, but the tradition associating the pyramids with forced labor goes back at least to Herodotus writing in the 5th century BC. He reported that the Pyramids were built by a cruel and rapacious pharoah ("Cheops", the historical [Khufu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu)) who dragooned the entire population into building them with great hardship. The whole relevant text is quoted in [The Greeks and Hellenized Romans knew the pyramids were ancient, but did they know how ancient? Are there any primary sources from then that try to put an age on the pyramids?](https://www.quora.com/The-Greeks-and-Hellenized-Romans-knew-the-pyramids-were-ancient-but-did-they-know-how-ancient-Are-there-any-primary-sources-from-then-that-try-to-put-an-age-on-the-pyramids) 

Many modern scholars believe that the pyramid workforce was generally well treated, although the evidence is debatable: [Great Pyramid tombs unearth 'proof' workers were not slaves](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/11/great-pyramid-tombs-slaves-egypt) (scare quotes in the original, and probably justified). 

Keep in mind that there's also a good deal of hand-waviness in the distinction between "slaves" and "free labor": There's lots of evidence for [corv√©e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corv%C3%A9e#Egypt) labor which isn't exactly slavery but isn't really free either, since the peasants who get drafted to dig a ditch or build a wall don't get a choice in the matter even if they get to go home when the work is done. It's not even clear if most Egyptian peasants were simply working-class people or if they were serfs, tied to the land and unable to choose their own occupations. Egypt certainly did have slaves, including slaves who worked in grueling, hazardous jobs like [mining](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/mining.htm). Under the Ptolemies an assignment to the mines was essentially a death sentence, and the Greek historian [Diodorus Siculus](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/law_and_order/diodorus.htm#3.12) at least thought that was the case in Pharaonic times as well. 

The debate over pyramid builders is really just a microcosm of a long running debate about ancient Egypt. 

 There is one camp which generally sees ancient Egypt as a benevolent, quasi-socialist state which took paternal care of its people. They cite the relative prosperity of the Egyptian countryside and a well-developed literature talking about the benevolence and care of the Pharaohs for their people. The opposite view regards the Pharaohs as typical ancient despots who freely expended the labor of their subjects with only minimal concern for the costs, or as vicious slave drivers. That view can be defended by citing ancient texts (both Herodotus and the Biblical Exodus) and Egypt's enormous expenditure of time and wealth on unproductive and self-glorifying monuments. 

In modern times the debate also gets shaded into questions of Egyptian nationalism, Afrocentrism and pro- or anti Biblical literalist arguments; views of Egyptian working conditions tends to line up with other views about Egyptians (or, sometimes, Jews). But it's actually very old debate. Even in the Greek period an Egyptian priest, [Manetho](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/home.html), wrote a book defending Egypt from what he called the 'lies' of Herodotus. Greek and Roman writers were also divided: some saw the Egyptians as possessors of serene ancient wisdom, others as a superstitious and priest-ridden rabble. 

The reality is like to be messier than any camp would prefer -- the fact that Herodotus' tour-guides and interpreters gave him such a negative view of the age of the Pyramid builders tells us something about Egypt in the 5th century BC if not the 25th: you can clearly see a lot of nationalistic pride in some of the things Herodotus was told in Egypt -- but some of the stories seem to reflect a much more cynical, worms-eye view of the glories of the past too. If Egypt was a hard place to be a working class person it would hardly be unique in the ancient (or modern!) world. As [ Ptah-hotep](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/precepts_of_ptahhotep.htm) said, _manual labor is little elevated; the inaction of the hands is honorable._ 

Moreover Egyptian civilization was very old and endured many ups and downs: foreign occupations, civil wars, feudal periods and the turmoil of the Amarna period. It would be surprising if all of that history didn't produce extremes of both good and bad.
