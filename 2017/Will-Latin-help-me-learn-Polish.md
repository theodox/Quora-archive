Maybe a little, since Polish is an inflected language like Latin: word order matters less than in English (or Portuguese) and the endings of the words are the primary way that the sentence is organized.

Latin teaching tends to go pretty heavy on grammar. It’s not uncommon for Latin students to get some benefits in their native languages, since so many schools do a bad job of teaching grammar; I actually found my English writing improved when Latin forced me to actually think about what I was trying to say instead of just saying it without consideration.

All that said… the vocabulary and grammar or Latin and Polish aren’t particularly close. You’d almost certainly get the more of bump from learning Czech or Russian which are much closer to Polish.
