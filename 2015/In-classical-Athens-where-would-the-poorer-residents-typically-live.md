The working class population tended to cluster in the [Piraeus](http://www.ancient.eu/Piraeus/), which provided a lot of employment for laborers working as longshoremen and rowers in the navy or merchant fleets. The [Kerameikos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerameikos), northwest of the Acropolis was also a lower-rent area (the part inside the walls: outside the walls it was a cemetery).

A lot of the population of "Athens" was actually rural. The aristocrats usually had their nicer places outside the city walls although the wealthier ones had town homes as well. Smaller farmers and rural laborers lived in the countryside unless an emergency forced them to crowd into the city as happened during the Peloponessian war when the crowding lead to a devastating plague. So much of the poverty was actually spread out in rural areas as well -- rocky areas, like Mt. Hymettus or Sounion, would be mostly thinly populated by shepherds or other marginal workers. The tyrant Peisistratus, for example, relied on the 'hillmen' -- the disenfranchised rural poor in marginal areas -- as his primary political supporters.
