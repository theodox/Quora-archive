They didn’t.

The key mechanic design otiginated as a student project at Digipen. Valve saw the potential on the game and hired the team to create a more commercial version with fancier production values. Valve has done this several times, with games like Team Fortress and Counter-Strike originating outside the company and being polished up to a high sheen.

Much of the Portal story is told well here : [Opening The Portal: Exploring The Game's Developmen](https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/10/opening-the-portal-exploring-portal-s-creation-and-its-ties-to-half-life-2.aspx)t or, for the reading averse, theres also this video:



Valve added a lot to the game — the graphic polish and above all the clever writing. But the core mechanic goes back to [Kim Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Swift) and the student team behind [Narbacular Drop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narbacular_Drop)
