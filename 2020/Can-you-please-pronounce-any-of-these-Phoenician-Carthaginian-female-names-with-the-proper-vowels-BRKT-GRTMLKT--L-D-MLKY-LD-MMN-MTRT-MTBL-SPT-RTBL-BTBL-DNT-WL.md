We have to __guess.__ These are recorded this way because Phoenician and Carthagininan were written without vowels — to give you the flavor, the Carthaginians referred to the Roman consulate as KNSWL’T and somebody named Sextus as SKST’. Our Hannibal was HNB’L and we are only clear about the vowels because his name was recorded by Latin and Greek speakers.

So — lacking good sources — we can only extrapolate. Sometimes there are recorded names which give us the vowels for common roots. Otherwise, Hebrew is a fairly close cousin, so we can use it as a guide. That said, the reconstructions have to be taken as guesses.

Phoenician naming was usually meaningful: “Hannibal” is _hanna ba’al_ “Gracious is the lord’. So, the meaningful parts of the names are often guessable using Hebrew: MLK is _milik_ , “king” and B’L is _ba’al_ , “lord”. BT is _bat,_ “daughter” and so on.

So, with appropriate caution here’s a couple we can guess based on Hebrew pieces and the way some names were recorded in other languages.

‘M'ŠMN _Ummeshmoun,_ “Eshmun is my mother”

'MŠTRT _Ummashtart_ , “Astarte is my mother”

'RŠTB'L _Arishatba’al,_ “Servant of the lord”

'ZRBL might be _Hazorbaal_ , “Baal is my help” or _Ozerbaal_  , _“Help, Baal!”_ though you’d expect an apostrophe between B and L.

‘BRKT might be _Habarakat_ or _Abarakat,_ “the blessing” .

ḤMLKY might be Himilkya (on the analogy of the related male name that’s rendered as Himilco in Latin)

'MTB'L shows up spelled phonetically in Akkadian as _Mataanbaal.,_ it would mean “gift of Baal” but in Latin it’s _Muthumbal_  — a good example of why you have to treat the vowels with caution!

After that it’s tougher — you have to find the roots (usually they come as three consonants), figure out the word they refer to in Phoenician, see if they have a Hebrew cognate, and borrow the vowels. There’s a reasons scholars generally stick to the consonant-only spellings once they start talking about people who didn’t manage to get their names recorded in Greek or Latin!
