It's not strictly your '3d' skills in most cases: you don't get a better appreciation for form and proportion or the nuances of shading by learning Python. That said...

It will make you more productive. CG is a very artificial art from. It involves hundreds, or even thousands of little decisions that have to be communicated to the computer: is this thing supposed to be smooth or faceted? Is it going to be matte or shiny (and if shiny, shiny like chrome? or like hair? or like brushed metal...?). Learning enough programming so that you can quickly narrow down the thousands of individual choices you could make to the handful you really care about will make your work faster and allow you to focus on the artistic side of the job. Turning a 10-button-click operation into a one-button-click Python script frees up a lot of precious brain cells to concentrate on taste, style, and storytelling. 

Plus, learning how things work under the hood will help you learn not to be afraid of all those buttons, sliders and checkboxes. As you get more comfortable with what's going on behind the UI you'll start to see how the numbers relate to what you're doing, so instead of guessing or just repeating something that worked last time you'll be able to use the settings more precisely and efficiently.

If you're not already a programmer, Python is definitely the easiest route into Maya. C# support is new and not well documented; C++ is just a harder language to work with as a beginner.
