The word is just Greek for “things related to Egypt.” Used as a title it typically refers to a work on the ancient history of Egypt— now largely lost — by the Egyptian priest [Manetho](https://pharaoh.se/manetho-king-list). It was written in Greek during the reign of the first two Ptolemies, so somewhere around 285 BC.

Most of the work is unfortunately lost, but there are substantial bits which survive in quotations from later Greek authors. Today it’s most famous for organizing Egyptian history into “dynasties”, a convention which we continue to use today. He’s also the source for many of the Greek names of various pharoahs, which are often the ones non-specialists use to this day.

Manetho was a priest and clearly used Egyptian sources; much of what he wrote has some degree of archaeological confirmation but not all. We don’t know much about his literary source material — apart the monumental inscriptions on temples and tombs, very little secular Egyptian literature has survived

Apart from his value as a source for older Egyptian traditions, Manetho provides a very valuable insight into the cultural ferment of the early Hellenistic world. Manetho represents a non-Greek author trying to present his own culture to a Greek audience — this involves an interesting mixture of nationalist pride and adaptation to the Greek perspective, a delicate dance which is very similar to the complexities of more recent post-colonial literature. His rough contemporaries [Berossus the Babylonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berossus) and [Sanchuniathon of Berytus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanchuniathon), and a couple of centuries later the Jewish writer [Philo of Alexandria](https://www.iep.utm.edu/philo/) let us see a little bit of how the political dominance of Greek empires looked to the other peoples of the Mediterranean world.

He’s also, indirectly, one of the sources of the Hermetic tradition of mysticism and alchemy — thus, indirectly, he’s a main source behind [Freemasonry ](https://freemasoninformation.com/2013/12/freemasonry-and-hermetica/)and The Magic Flute. Very little survives of his religious writing, but it was cited by Greek and Roman authors interested in Egyptian mysticism.
