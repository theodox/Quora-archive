I was told this story by a former Microsoft employee who claims to know it first hand.

If you ever installed Microsoft Windows in the 90's or early 2000's you probably remember the interminable wait which happened after the OS was installed and the computer booted up for the first time. The scads of little applications which the OS included - the calculator, the calendar, notepad, and so on (which, let's face it, hardly anybody ever actually used) had to initialize themselves and their registry settings for the first time . Each one was individually trivial, but collectively this little ritual added a long time -- I remember it as being 30-40 minutes, but perhaps my memory exaggerates - to the process of installing a new copy of windows.

My informant told me that it would have been simple to include the initial files with the Windows. He said, however, that this was not done because the person(s) at Microsoft who did the final build of Windows release candidates didn't like waiting thirty or forty minutes every time the release candidates were built and tested. So, they decided to save themselves half an hour a few times during the release cycle by not including the settings....

...thereby sentencing every one of the tens of millions of people who installed Windows during that decade or so to an extra half an hour of waiting. 

My guess is that this system affected something like 50 millions installations of Windows. At half an hour apiece, that totals a bit more than 2,891 years of wasting other people's time - including leap years. It's the Great Pyramid of time wasting, the Taj Mahal of using other people's precious moments on earth like disposable handi-wipes.
