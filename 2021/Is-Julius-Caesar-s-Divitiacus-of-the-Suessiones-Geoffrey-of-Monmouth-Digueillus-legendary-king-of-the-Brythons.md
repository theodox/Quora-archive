Somebody says so:



However I don’t buy it for two reasons:

The historic Divitiacus was an Aeduan, from modern Burgundy; these weren’t the Gauls who had regular contact with Britain (those would be the Veneti, the Atrabates, and the Belgae. If a dim historical memory crossed the channel I’d expect it from there, or maybe from Brittany. His son [Heli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beli_Mawr#Geoffrey_of_Monmouth's_Heli), identified as _Beli Mawr_  is probably etymologically connected to the Belgae.

The name appears in three forms: Digueillus, Cligueillus, and Eligueillus — only one of these is even remotely connected to Diviatacus. It went into Welsh as _Llefelys,_ probably from the _Eligueillus_ version.
