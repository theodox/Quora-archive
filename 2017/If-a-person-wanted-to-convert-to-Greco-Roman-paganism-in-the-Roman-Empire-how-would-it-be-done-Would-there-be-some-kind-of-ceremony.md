# If a person wanted to convert to Greco-Roman paganism in the Roman Empire, how would it be done? Would there be some kind of ceremony?

As the other answers point out, Greco-Roman polytheism isn’t a “faith”. It had no catechism and no stable belief structures. There were various groups under that broad umbrella which did have something like a congregational model with instruction in a creed and initiatory ceremonies (common examples would be the [Eleusinian Mysteries,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries) the [Mysteries of Isis, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysteries_of_Isis)and [Mithraism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithraism)) but these were the beliefs of a committed minority, not the ordinary pieties of the standard civic cult.

It may be easier to think about most Greco-Roman religious experience on the analogy of the modern round of annual holidays: you don’t have to be a patriot to go to 4th of July picnics, you don’t have to support labor unions to celebrate Labor Day, you don’t have to be particularly concerned with the souls of the departed to dress up for Halloween. Lots of Americans wear green on St. Patrick’s Day or have tacos for Cinco de Mayo without ‘converting’ to Irishness or Mexicanity.

Like Greco-Roman paganism these shared occasions focus on practice — public practice — rather than conviction. And, (again like it) they reflect a complex history of past changes from the high-water marks of different ethnic groups to the struggles of the past. Fundamentally Greco-Roman civic religion was something you _did_ , not something you _believed._ 

You can ‘convert’ to that kind of public participation quite easily — immigrants to the US tend to pick up this kind of public ritual behavior quite quickly. But that kind of participation is easy because it’s extremely undemanding, and basically non-coercive. In that sense you ‘convert’ by simply showing up. Whatever else you do at home — honoring the gods of your homeland, or no gods at all — doesn’t matter much as long as you behave like your neighbors in public.

Of course not everybody will do that. Then as now, making a point of abstaining from these kinds of things — being the sort of person who won’t stand up when the national anthem is sung at a baseball game, or who won’t celebrate birthday parties because they are a pagan superstition — tends to earn you a reputation as a prig or make you a target for harassment. In the ancient world religious outliers were usually dismissed as cranks — but in times of insecurity, identifiable outsider communities (including “pagan” followers of Bacchus and Isis as well as Christians and Jews) [could face serious repression](https://www.quora.com/How-would-history-change-if-the-status-quo-of-religion-in-the-Roman-Empire-persisted/answer/Steve-Theodore) or popular persecution.

There was also enforced conformity. The Romans and the Hellenistic kings demanded the appearance, at least, of loyalty from their subjects, [usually in the form of oaths and sacrifices.](http://philipharland.com/greco-roman-associations/oath-of-loyalty-to-augustus-by-paphlagonians-and-roman-businessmen-3-bce/) In some times and places the administration of these loyalty tests was a routine bureaucratic and political matter, akin to being “sworn in” as a witness in court. However some rulers — particularly those who were on shaky political ground — demanded actual worship, rather than just a public profession of allegiance. Willingness to participate in public emperor-worship was regarded as inseparable from political loyalty even by people who did not themselves take the divinity of the emperors seriously; so any group which balked offering sacrifice to the emperor could expect harsh treatments. There was no exception for private beliefs: the idea of “liberty of conscience” was not part of the intellectual apparatus of antiquity. So, in that sense, anybody who planned on living in a Greek kingdom or the Roman empire had to “convert” whether they liked it or not unless they were willing to risk loss of property or loss of life.
