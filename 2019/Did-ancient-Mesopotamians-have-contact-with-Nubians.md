The most obvious and unambiguous example is rather late: the[ Assyrian conquest of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_stele_of_Esarhaddon) (starting in 673 B.C.) was a really a fight between Egypt and the Nubian kingdom of [Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush), which had been ruling Egypt since 774 B.C.

A couple of centuries later, during the Persian occupation of Egypt, the Kushite kingdom of [Meroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB) was tributary to the Persians (at least that’s how the Persians described it — the Kushites might have seen it as “diplomatic relations”). A large levy of Kushite troops accompanied the Persian army which invaded Greece in 480 B.C. As part of that expedition they would have rubbed shoulders with the Chaldean and Assyrian contingents in that army, as well as the many Mesopotamian scribes who formed the administrative backbone of the Persian empire.

Apart from those two well-known examples, things are rather more speculative. There’s a school of thought in which the “land of [Magan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magan_(civilization))”, which in ancient Sumerian texts is an exotic, distant trade destination, is identified with Nubia or at least with the Red Sea coast. However the more usual identification is with the area now occupied by the gulf states, particularly Oman or the U.A.E.
