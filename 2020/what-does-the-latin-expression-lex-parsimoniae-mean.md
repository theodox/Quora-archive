Literally it would be ‘the law of stinginess’ (_parsimonia_  survives in English as ‘parsimony’ with the same basic connotation of thrift). However used as a complete phrase it is what we usually call ‘Occam’s razor.’ — the idea that for any given phenomenon the simplest explanation is the likeliest to be correct.
