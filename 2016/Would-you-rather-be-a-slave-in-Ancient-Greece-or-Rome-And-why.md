With some qualifications, Rome would be a better choice.

__TLDR__ .

Rome was generally better at dealing with non-Romans than Greece was at dealing with non-Greeks. Classical Greek culture really gelled during an era when tight bonds between fellow citizens of a small, compact community were paramount to survival. Greek cities tended to be extremely exclusive: it was very hard for fellow Greeks to get citizenship in a different city (Athens was notoriously restrictive: at one point you needcd to be able to prove that all of your grandparents were free citizens to be an Athenian citizen). Rome, by contrast, became powerful largely because the Romans did a good job of co-opting their neighbors. Greek neighbor cities like Athens and Thebes remained bitter rivals for centuries; the Romans on the other hand turned defeated enemies like the Latins into close allies and fellow-citizens.*

An important side effect of this was a different attitude towards slaves, particularly in regards to manumission. Roman law was generally more favorable to manumission of slaves, and Roman society was much more willing to accept a freedman as a “Roman” once they had been freed. While ex-slaves were not exactly first-class Roman citizens, their children were: a marked contrast to most of Greece. Rich, powerful freedmen were a regular feature of Roman social life, particularly in the middle imperial period ( the infamous [Trimalchio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimalchio), who’s the byword for gaudy Roman excess, is a freed slave as well as a millionaire). Social ties between freed slaves and their former masters were regarded as important on both ends: many former slaves included the names of their previous owners even on their tombstones.

Also, over time Roman law gradually extended some kinds of humanitarian protection for slaves. Under the Antonines a master who beat a slave to death ‘for disciplinary purposes’ could be fined, and one who excessively maltreated them could have them forcibly sold off. Constantine finally made it a crime for owners to kill or torture their own slaves — though torture remained the only form of testimony a slave could give in court down to the end. Constantine also made it illegal to forcibly separate slave families. He also tried to forbid the immemorial practice of poor families selling their own children into slavery, providing public funds which were supposed to support those who would otherwise have been sold or starved.

Byzantine slavery was primarily an extension of Roman rather than Greek principles. The big Byzantine innovation was increasing legislation to protect slaves from sexual exploitation. Classical Greek and Roman practice assumed as a matter of course that ownership of a slave — male or female, adult or child — granted sexual access to the slave’s body. Starting in the 5th century Christian emperors (and empresses: Justinian’s wife Theodora had been a social outcast as a young woman, and advocated for the dispossessed) outlawed the use of slaves as prostitutes, which until that time had been an industrial scale aspect of both Greek and Roman life.

__Qualifications__ :

The number one qualification is: _don’t be a slave_ . Even the most benevolent kind of slavery is tyranny. The non-benevolent kinds were awful.

_The slave-worked silver mines of Athens were a incredibly dangerous — and busy. Over 20,000 slaves at a time worked there in brutal conditions. Rome had its own share of horrible slave occupations, including of course the gladiatorial arenas._ 

That said, life as a slave could vary considerably in both Greece and Rome. A skilled technician (a doctor, say, or somebody like Cicero’s secretary [Tiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Tullius_Tiro)) could have comfortable and secure life — moreso than large sections of the free lower classes. On the other hand the life of a slave on the rowing bench of a galley, in the silver mines of Laurium, or in a gladiatorial arena was likely to be short and brutal. Both societies produced callous, bone-chilling discussions of slavery (Aristotle’s description of slaves as ‘living tools’ is often quoted, but I find [Cato the Elder’s](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html) regime far more horrendous). Both also produced literature in which slaves are fully realized human beings (often ones who get the better of their dimwitted masters) and treasured friends.

There were significant ups and downs in the economic and social life of slaves in both Greece and Rome. In general, periods where the price of labor was high and the supply of slaves low led to better treatment and more opportunities for freedom. The converse was also true: when the market was glutted with slaves the conditions worsened, sometimes quite badly. The aftermath of the Peloponnesian war in Greece and the years following the destruction of Carthage and Corinth in Rome both saw huge influxes of slaves and correspondingly more casual maltreatment and brutality. Most of the time slavery in the ancient world was less dire than slavery in the American South, but during those peak periods it definitely reached similar levels of horror.

The relations between freed slaves and former owners in Rome were not entirely voluntary. A freedman or woman became part of the former owner’s clientele, a status which had real, legally binding implications — it wasn’t necessarily a purely social relationship based on affection for ‘old marse.’

Prohibition on cruelty and sexual exploitation of slavers were obviously limited by the very minimal power of the state to supervise society. The fact that they were repeatedly re-enacted, sometimes for centuries, suggests that the difference between theory and practice could be very wide.

Finally, it’s worth remembering that a lot of ‘Greek’ history _is_  Roman history. After the 1st century Roman legal institutions tended to crowd out Greek ones in much of the Greek east, and Greek practice of manumission tended to approximate the Roman more and more over time.



> … For my part, I regard his treatment of his slaves like beasts of burden, using them to the uttermost, and then, when they were old, driving them off and selling them, as the mark of a very mean nature, which recognizes no tie between man and man but that of necessity. 2 And yet we know that kindness has a wider scope than justice. Law and justice we naturally apply to men alone; but when it comes to beneficence and charity, these often flow in streams from the gentle heart, like water from a copious spring, even down to dumb beasts. A kindly man will take good care of his horses even when they are worn out with age, and of his dogs, too, not only in their puppyhood, but when their old age needs nursing.

The contradictions of slavery in a nutshell: Plutarch on Cato the Elder.



_* It’s a bit more complex than I’m making out here, and full equality between non-Romans and Romans still took some centuries and a war. But the pattern is surprisingly enduring - even a great multicultural melting pot like Alexandria, 600 years after its foundation, had a narrow citizen pool of Greeks while its Jewish and Egyptian residents remained outsiders to a large degree._
