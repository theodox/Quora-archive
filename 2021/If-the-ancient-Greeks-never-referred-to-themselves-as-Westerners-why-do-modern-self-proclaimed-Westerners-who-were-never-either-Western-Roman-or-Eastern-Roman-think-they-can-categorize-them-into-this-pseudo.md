# If the ancient Greeks never referred to themselves as "Westerners", why do modern self-proclaimed "Westerners (who were never either Western Roman or Eastern Roman)" think they can categorize them into this pseudo-ethnicity?

It’s a bit more complicated than the question makes out.

In pre-Roman times, the Greeks saw the world as divided into Hellenes and barbarians, not easterners and westerners. To the extent that there was an ideological framework around it at all, the idea was that Hellenes occupied a central place where all of the conflicting extremes of climate and culture were moderated. The classic text for this is the _[Airs, Waters, Places](http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/airwatpl.1.1.html)_ traditionally attributed to Hippocrates, which laid out a theory that was basically climate determinism: humans adapted to different environments with different behaviors. In this view there were uncivilized barbarians in the cold north, decadent peoples living in luxury in the mild climate of “Asia” (by which they meant our Asia Minor), and overly-intellectual, passive people living in the hot south. The Greeks, occupying a midpoint between these extremes, were supposedly (_coincidence?_ ) a perfectly balanced mix of conflicting traits.

To suspicious modern eyes the generalization in _Airs, Waters Places_ seems a lot like racism, but when the text traffics in generalizations they are based on climate, rather than biological descent. Greeks living in the mild, fruitful climate of Asia are said to be as unmanly as their barbarian neighbors. Of course that generalized opposition between “European” moderation and “Asian” excess mapped, took on a life of its own for political reasons. The difference between Greek and Barbarian in general was easy to confuse the specific conflict between (much of) Hellas and the Persian Empire.

The political conflict between Hellenic independence and Persian autocracy mapped easily onto the “climactic” difference between Hellenic frugality and Persian excess:

> "... he ordered the bakers and the cooks to prepare the dinner Mardonius usually enjoyed. When Pausanias saw the luxurius daybeds, as well as the gold and silver tables loaded with the majestic dinner, he was surprised. As a joke, he ordered his own servants to prepare a Spartan dinner. The difference was so great that he laughed, called all the Generals of the Greeks and said to them, pointing to the two dinners: "Greeks, I called you here to show you the foolishness of the Median ruler who dines like this everyday and moved against us to steal our poverty."

The Persian wars (which lasted, in various degrees of intensity, for more than a century) crystallized a stereotypical confrontation between the “independence-minded”, “brave”, and “moderate” Greeks and the “slavish”, “decadent” Persians. Herodotus, significantly, closes his book not with a Greek victory parade but with advice from the Persian emperor Cyrus:

> [Artembares said] “Seeing that Zeus grants lordship to the Persian people, and to you, Cyrus, among them, let us, after reducing Astyages, depart from the little and rugged land which we possess and occupy one that is better. There are many such lands on our borders, and many further distant. If we take one of these, we will all have more reasons for renown. It is only reasonable that a ruling people should act in this way, for when will we have a better opportunity than now, when we are lords of so many men and of all Asia?”

> Cyrus heard them, and found nothing to marvel at in their design; “Go ahead and do this,” he said; “but if you do so, be prepared no longer to be rulers but rather subjects._Soft lands breed soft men; wondrous fruits of the earth and valiant warriors grow not from the same soil”_ 

The contrast of Greek virtue and barbarian decadence was mostly self-congratulatory bunk, of course. Still, the moral claim (moderation means independence, luxury is linked to servility) became a key part of internal arguments about proper way for Greeks to organize their own society. The supposed connection between frugality, political freedom and manliness became a trope that was central to Greek self-image for many centuries to come, even when there was no “eastern” opponent to measure up against.

Eventually, though, those frugal and independent-minded Greeks found themselves, for the most part, subjects of huge, wealthy kingdoms tied together by a vast network of international trade. Great-great-grandchildren of the Greeks who faced off against the Persians found themselves ruling as satraps over huge swathes of the old Persian empire, enjoying luxuries that would have made their forefathers blush. The scale of the new kingdoms created opportunities for social stratification that never existed in a the small face-to-face world of city-states. Moralists still liked to compare Greek moderation with a stereotypical “barbarian” luxury — but usually in order to criticize fellow Greeks.

In fact, the association of virtue and simplicity started to look positively bad for the Greeks. The most salient barbarians of the day — the Gauls who rampaged through Greece and Asia Minor — were embodiments not of luxury and vice but of the forgotten simple life. Sometimes they were depicted as the faceless forces of barbarism — but often they were seen as a sentimental ideal of simpler times. As the political contrast of east and west lost meaning, images of barbarian simplicity became a reproach to Greeks who had become the wealthy imperialists they once defined themselves against.

Rome rose to power in _that_ Greek context. Roman ideas about their own society reflected the old Greek tradition equating moderation, political freedom, and military virtue. It was easy to borrow the existing Greek discourse about luxury, effeminacy, and servility and turn it against the Greeks themselves, since from a Roman (and often, from a Greek) point of view the Greeks embodied those same vices. Greeks had stereotyped their Persian enemies as corrupt and decadent and unfit for self-rule. Romans did the same to the Greeks.

However the long, complex marriage of Greek culture and Roman power ended in compromise. The majority of the people living under the Roman empire interacted with the state in Greek, not Latin. The idea that soft living undermining political freedom and manliness remained a popular moral stance — but it became acceptable to be vague about who exactly was living a life of manly independence and who wasn’t: the Romans, after all, ended up just as enervated by the profits of their own empire as the Greeks had been.

Thus, when Octavian went to war with Marc Antony the conflict was portrayed as one of old-fashioned Roman virtues against the luxuries and decadence of “the East.” However the reality was two immensely rich Roman warlords grubbing for power at the head of polyglot armies.

The rise of the empire and the death of Roman republicanism rendered old moralisms about freedom less attractive. On the other hand the re-emergence of a Persian threat (in the form of the Parthians and later the Sassanids) helped to paper over the Greek-Roman tension. The externalized contrast of east and west was a useful rallying point for the long centuries of on-again, off-again wars with Persia — it was satisfyingly old fashioned (particularly in the Greek speaking half of the empire, where Herodotus and Aeschylus remained current reading) but also helpfully vague: one could still identify with the victors of Marathon or Actium while glossing over the fact that one’s own life didn’t live up to their spartan strictures.

This balancing act remained viable for a very long time: the Roman world faced off against Persia for almost seven centuries. For most of that time, Persia was the only outside power that Rome had to deal with on an equal footing. This gave the east-west opposition that first emerged in the days of Xerxes a chance to become thoroughly internalized in both Greek and Roman literature. The trifecta of luxury, slavishness and otherness had a long time to become cemented as a stereotype of “the east” since the east was the only place in which the Romans could recognize an enemy of equal stature. It’s no an accident that the hippodrome in new capital, Constantinople — a site chosen because it was well positioned for the defense of the eastern provinces — was decorated with the [Serpent Column](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/constantinople-istanbul/constantinople-photos/constantinople-hippodrome/constantinople-hippodrome-serpent-column/) dedicated by the Spartans to commemorate the victory at Plataea.

That long incubation period — leaving traces in centuries worth of literature — means the old tropes about east and west are always lying around ready to hand when the cultural moment makes it convenient. If you grew up in the European literary tradition any time from the 1450s to the 1950’s, you were familiar with this old saw, which tended to make it self perpetuating.

In short: the east-west dichotomy survived as a trope because it was politically useful at times and morally interesting at others. Simply by virtue of surviving a long time it became a self-perpetuating reflex, one that fades and revives as the needs of the moment seem to dictate. It had a resonance in the Cold War that it lost in the 90’s. 9/11 and the so-called “Clash of Civilization” gave it a brief revival. The ghosts of Marathon are being laid to rest for now, but they’ll be back the next time there’s a plausible analogy and somebody needs to make a rousing speech.
