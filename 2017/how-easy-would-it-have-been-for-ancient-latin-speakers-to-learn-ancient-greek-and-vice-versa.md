It was not trivial, but it was generally easier for them than it would be for an English speaker to learn either language. Grammatically the languages have significant similarities (see [During antiquity, did anyone in Greece or Rome recognize similarities between Greek and Latin languages and hypothesize relationships between them?](https://www.quora.com/During-antiquity-did-anyone-in-Greece-or-Rome-recognize-similarities-between-Greek-and-Latin-languages-and-hypothesize-relationships-between-them)) whereas for us the inflection and cavalier approach to word order is a huge stumbling block.

There’s a surprising amount of surviving Greek->Latin and Latin->Greek bilingual material for ancient language learners (see [How did people in ancient times study foreign languages?](https://www.quora.com/How-did-people-in-ancient-times-study-foreign-languages)) They followed a familiar format of parallel word lists, tables of conjugation for verbs or declension for nouns, and learning dialogs.

_A 12th century bilingual text (a copy of a Roman era original) . The odd numbered columns are in Greek (transliterated into Latin characters) and the even ones are Latin. You can see, for example,_ ___ton patera___ _and_ ___patrem___ _(“father” in the accusative case) about half way down the first two columns ._ 

It’s clear from some of the surviving material that the process was far from error-free; there are lots of examples of misspellings, not-quite-idiomatic usages, and other mistakes. There was a lot of linguistic exchange, however — most educated Romans learned Greek as part of their educations, and a Greek speaker who wanted a career in the army, the law courts, or the imperial bureaucracy had to learn Latin (a lot of the surviving material comes from what seem to be fast catch-up courses for Greek lawyers who wanted to argue in front of Roman judges).

In the lower ranks of society, urban settings were also polyglot due in large part to the slave trade, but also the movement of people in the army and commerce. You can see in things like the plays of [Plautus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plautus#Understanding_of_Greek_by_Plautus.27_audience) that he expects a significant fraction of his audience to get some aspects of his Greek jokes and references (interestingly, in the [Poenulus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0106%3Aact%3D5%3Ascene%3D1) he also got something that certainly sounds like Punic - it’s the only long-from bit of “Punic” dialog that survives — more evidence that Rome was linguistically complex). Only rural areas were likely to be monoglot in either Greek or Latin.
