No. Thutmose’s campaign was directed primarily against the [Mitanni](https://www.ancient.eu/Mitanni/), whose power was centered in modern Syria. Most of the actual fighting was in Canaan and Lebanon, where there were many small city-states whose allegiances were up for grabs.

During the relatively peaceful reign of his predecessor, queen [Hatshepsut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatshepsut), many of the Canaanite cities had aligned themselves with the Mittani despite their nominal vassalage to Egypt, so the first major phase of Thutmose’s campaigns was aimed at forcing these back into the Egyptian sphere of interest. The showpiece of those campaigns was the battle of [Megiddo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Megiddo_(15th_century_BC)) (the ultimate origin of “Armageddon”) but the fighting dragged on for many years as Thutmose systematically reduced the fortified cities one by one.

Once Canaan was secure Thutmose pushed on towards what was, for him, the real source of the problem— the Mitanni. Their power base was in modern Syria. Thutmose scored several victories against the Mittani (notably at [Carchemish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carchemish) on the upper Euphrates) but was only able to retain permanent control of the coast and western Syria — this probably reflects the huge logistical problems of supplying a Bronze Age army in hostile territory.

Fifteenth century BC Assyria was a second-rank power, isolated from the power struggles of the Mediterranean coast. A good deal of formerly Assyrian territory was under Mitanni control, and many Assyrian kings of this period were effectively Mitanni vassals.

When Thutmose was campaigning successfully in Syria he did receive gifts from the Assyrians. Egyptian records describe this as “tribute” — but Egyptian records traditionally treat many kinds of foreign relations as tributary, so it’s not possible to know what the diplomatic realities were. it’s safe to assume , given the long and bitter history between the Mitanni and the Assyrians, that Egyptian-Assyrian relations were fairly friendly while Thutmose was humbling the Mittani.

Ultimately, Thutmose’s attacks on the Mittani set the stage for an Assyrian revival. A couple of centuries would see the Mittani kingdom destroyed and the Assyrians as the mightiest of the Bronze Age great powers. That however was a long after Thutmose’s day.
