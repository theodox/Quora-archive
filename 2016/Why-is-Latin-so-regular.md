ooooh... I _wish_ . Latin has plenty of irregular grammatical formations, for example [irregular verbs ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Latin_irregular_verbs)and confusing [irregular plurals. ](http://blogs.transparent.com/latin/irregular-third-declension-plural-nouns/)And there's that whole thing about names ending in -us for singular and -i for plurals... except for the [fourth declension](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Latin_fourth_declension)  when the plural is -u; and words ending with -a are usually feminine singulars... except when they are neuter plurals. 

You get the picture.

One reason Latin does look comparatively 'regular' is that our sources are unusual. We know modern languages because we hear and see them all around us: our understanding of a modern language includes the erratic usage, mis-spellings, and bad habits of an entire population. For Latin we generally only hear from a highly selective subset of Latin authors, drawn overwhelmingly from the best educated and most literate members of their society: it's not a fair comparison unless you include folks like the Pompeiian who wrote

_Amantes, ut apis_ _vita mellita exigunt._ 

Which ought to be _Amantes, ut apes_ _vitam mellitam exigent,_ "Lovers, like bees, make life as sweet as honey.__"__ 

Just like today, words mutated over time: _auris, "ear"_  became _auriculum_ , "little ol' ear" and then _oricla --_ which is how French got French _oreille_ , Italian _orecchio_ , Spanish _oreja_ and so on. Most modern Romance languages use morphed versions of Latin for every day objects: a lot of the familiar, formal latin-sounding ones were added in the 17th or 18th century by literary types trying to make their language more classical: thus Latin _porta_ , a city gate, becomes French _porte:_ a regular old door. And lots of words were incorporated from foreign sources: _blundus_  for blonde and _blancus_  for white both come from German. 

Natrually, all of those changes and additions create more and more irregularities, exceptions and corner cases. It's language cruft. And since all modern Romance languages have 2000 years of accumulated cruft since the days of Cicero its not surprising the older language looks cleaner.
