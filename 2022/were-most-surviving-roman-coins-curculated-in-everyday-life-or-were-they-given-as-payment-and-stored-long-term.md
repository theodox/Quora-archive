The Roman economy was very cash-dependent; minting silver (the dominant currency metal) was practiced on such a scale that we can actually track its rise and fall through the presence of metallic residues in arctic ice cores:

It’s also true, though, that our surviving stocks of Roman coins doesn’t exactly look like what you’d expect from that graph. Rome didn’t [have central banking or many other of the financial tools of a modern economy](https://www.quora.com/How-much-more-powerful-could-the-Roman-Empire-have-become-with-a-thorough-understanding-of-modern-economics-and-finance/answer/Steve-Theodore) — essentially the only real financial tool at a Roman emperor’s disposal was to call in existing coins and re-mint them at a different purity level, effectively “3D printing money”. This means our samples are biased towards the numerous, lower quality late coins.

This does have some impact on what we see in the archaeology. Many of the higher quality coins that do survive were hoarded for their higher metal value — if you had a nice high quality silver denarius from say, Tiberius you had about 3.9g of silver at 97 or 98% purity. By the mid second century a denarius was only 3.41g at purity lower than 80% — in quantity, that meant a lot. So even though you’d need to be careful how you spent your older coins it made sense to hold onto them. Particularly in a large scale transaction the difference in weight-of-metal could make a big difference — the “real value” of denarius from the mid-third century was half that of a high-quality imperial issue three centuries earlier. So — in a world without routine consumer banking and one that was beset by bouts of coin debasement a lot of Roman coins were hoarded.

That said, though, it’s obvious that the [sheer scale of Roman coin finds](https://chre.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/) is directly related to the ubiquity of cash in the Roman era. We have found, literally, millions of Roman coins, and those are a tiny fraction of those that were issued. The usual accounting unit was the [silver sesertius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sestertius), one quarter of the silver denarius and roughtly the cost of a two loaves of bread. Modern estimates of Roman state spending tend to run around a 1,000,000,000 sestertii (or 250 million silver denarii) per year.¹ Modern efforts to guess at total Roman coin production are [notoriously contentious](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43580408), more than a billion coins in coins in circulation at any moment in time is [not an unreasonable guess](https://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=Roman%20Coins%20-%20How%20Many%20Were%20Made) — and that’s only imperial coins: many local jurisdictions minted their own coins as well.

The net result of all this metal in circulation was an imperial economy that functioned on a market basis to an unprecedented degree. With relatively safe transportation, predictable tariffs, and a more-or-less unified currency the empire as a whole was a huge common market. Unlike many pre-modern economies it was possible to make a profit even on bulk commodities (selling North African grain to Italy, or selling Gallic-made, Italian-style terra sigilata to Egypt) thanks to an efficient cash market: although barter never went away, monetary transactions were a defining feature of Roman life in the high empire.

You can see this in all sorts of ways — here, for example, is a graffito scratched on a wall in Pompeii recording a small-scale pawn:

> Idibus Iuli(i)s inaures postas ad Faustilla(m) pro |(denariis) II usura(m) deduxit aeris a(ssem) ex sum(ma) XXX

> On July fifteenth I pawned earrings to Faustilla for 2 denarii (equivalent to 32 asses). From this amount, she deducted one-thirtieth as interest for the monthly usury of one as

[CIL IV 8203](http://ancientgraffiti.org/Graffiti/graffito/AGP-EDR128559)

Or this receipt, also from Pompeii (in [typically illegible ordinary Roman handwriting](https://qr.ae/pvCIDp)) — again the unit is the bronze [as ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_(Roman_coin))(a tenth of a denarius).

However this highly cash-driven economy did not last, for several reasons. Compare this map of coin hoards for the first three centuries of the empire:

with this one for the next three hundred years

These numbers reinforce something we can see in literary sources as well: the economy of the later empire was de-monetising.² After the crisis of the third century and the reforms which followed the empire retreated from its cash-driven, market-oriented peak towards a more rural economy with more localized production, more payment in kind, and less circulating cash. Precious metal stocks seem to have been depleted, and the government — desperate to continue fielding armies — began to experiment with localized payment in kind. Meanwhile wealthy people, in an effort to escape taxation, invested in more and more self-sufficient rural estates. All of this together set the stage for the feudal system, which was ultimately [a solution to the problem of running states with very little cash in circulation](https://www.quora.com/Was-a-feudal-system-in-medieval-Europe-a-good-form-of-government/answer/Steve-Theodore).

Cash never disappeared but it played less and less of a role in daily life until around the 9th century (an uptick which is still visible in the graph above).



¹ٰ Theoretically all of that spending ought to have been cash; in practice much of it will have been reconciled without coins changing hand: a Roman soldier was nominally owed 50 denarii a month in the first century — but we’ve got [surviving pay slips which show a lot of expenses deducted from that total,](https://taskandpurpose.com/mandatory-fun/roman-soldier-payslip-green-weenie-immortal/) leaving next to no cash actually being disbursed. Still, with some hundreds of thousand men under arms the Roman state was on the hook for 6–700,000,000 denarii per year; even if only a fraction of that were actually paid out it’s a lot of money… and it covers well less than 10% of the adult population.

²To be clear, there are multiple things going on in these images. Coin hoards are an index of the ubiquity of cash, of course, but they are also as an index of social instability — that’s why the eastern half of the empire, which was still a functioning cash economy in throughout both periods, is under represented in the second image: There were fewer instances of scared property owners stashing an amphora of coins in a field as a form of insurance. Still, the images are strongly suggestive of what we know from other sources about the retreat from a cash market towards rural self sufficiency in the later empire.
