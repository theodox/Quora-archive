Harry Turtledove wrote an elegaic short story on this, "Counting Potsherds", which I believe is in this anthology [What Might Have Been: Volume 1: Gregory Benford, Martin Greenberg: 9780743487290: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074348729X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=074348729X&linkCode=as2&tag=tecsurgui-20&linkId=JXD3G7T5X436GAV2)

The thesis -- I'm not sure I buy it, but it's interesting to ponder -- is that many important pieces of our modern mental equipment would never have come along: politics (which we get, of course, from the Greek _polis_ ) and the ideal of an open society in which debates and disagreement, rather than obedience to will of the king or a god (or a king who is a god). 

 Very long stretches of human history have passed without the idea that ordinary people get to decide what's best for themselves instead of waiting for orders from above. If the Persians had won, it's certainly plausible to imagine a world in which open societies didn't emerge, at least not in Europe. Since our understanding of the whole idea has been shaped so powerfully by the Greek experience, it's an not entirely fanciful idea. 

 On the whole I think it's an overstatement, though -- there are more than a few outcroppings of free societies which don't derive directly from the Greek version. Even in antiquity, Roman civic institutions for example don't depend on Greek foundations; and the city-states of Renaissance Italy, the Hanseatic League, or swiss Cantons all taught themselves how to govern themselves without reading Thucydides. 

To some degree its a contest between a 'history of ideas' approach, in which the intellectual impact of the Greek experiments is paramount and a more economic or social-history focus in which emphasis goes on things like merchant classes defending their economic interests.
