I’d just add that this is Pytheas’ clumsy effort to describe [pancake ice and grease ice](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/characteristics/formation.html) to a home audience that didn’t believe in ice at sea. He was roundly disbelieved. however you can see where he got the ‘jellyfish’ analogy. Add in thick fogs and it’s not as bizarre as it sounds.
