# Were the Dacians and the Romans related people? If not, how come the Dacians were so rapidly "romanised" after they were conquered?

The Danubian region is one of the few cases where demographic changes play a pretty big role in linguistic assimilation.

_Note the depth of the military presence — this wan’t just a line of forts along the frontier._

_The Balkan frontier after the abandonment of upper Dacia in the 3d century. At different times Sirmium, Naissus, Viminiacum and Adrianople all served as imperial headquarters._ 

Because the Danube watershed was the most important sector of the Roman military frontier from the time of the Trajan through the 6th century, there was [much more sustained movement of people into the area from the rest of the empire ](http://www.peeters-leuven.be/boekoverz.asp?nr=8878)than was normal in less militarized parts of the empire. Epigraphic evidence from the area shows remarkably few local names and a correspondingly broad range of names from the rest of the empire. Since all of those soldiers spoke Latin as their common tongue (even if it was only their second language) Latin became the de-facto local tongue as well.

Despite the frequent conflicts with the Romans the native Dacians also, like the Germans along the Rhine, absorbed a lot of indirect influences as well. Trade went on whenever there was no fighting, and it’s likely that Latin spread beyond the formal boundaries of Roman control much as Greek had penetrated into Thrace even while it was independent in the Hellenistic period.

Like pretty much everybody else in the Balkans the Dacians derived from the same Indo-European stock that ultimately produced both the Italic and Celtic languages, but the relationships aren’t clear in more detail than that. It was probably pretty close to Thracian and perhaps to Illyrian — but as an unlettered language we have very little beyond names to really work with.
