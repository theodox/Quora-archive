There’s a good case to be made that it depends on whom you ask.

The Republic was — at home, anyway — a free society with more or less democratic self governance. It had annual elections, the rule of law, and very real political conflicts which resulted in social change. While it’s true that the Senate was more or less an oligarchy, it was not completely static: outsiders were able to muscle their way in (some of the most famous Romans — [Marius](http://www.livius.org/pictures/a/roman-portraits/marius/), [Cato the Elder, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Elder)and [Cicero ](http://www.livius.org/pictures/a/roman-portraits/cicero/)to name a few — were “new men,” politicians who made it to the inner circle of Roman politics without blue-blooded aristocratic backgrounds. Legally, Rome was [a more direct democracy than any modern state](https://www.quora.com/Was-the-Roman-Republic-a-democracy/answer/Steve-Theodore): Romans voted directly on matters of policy, or war and peace, and of constitutional change. It’s true that these votes were deliberately weighted in favor of the wealthy — but it’s also true that lower classes forced pretty significant social changes on their betters through the political process.

In contrast the empire was a monarchy, which usually didn’t have even the semblance of a constitutional sanction. The Senate provided a figleaf of legitimacy sometimes, but at least half if not more Roman emperors were the leaders of military coups. A Roman emperor was not bound by law in any meaningful way: an emperor had the power of life or death over all subjects, rich or poor, free and slave. There was no real legislature at the imperial level, and local governments could be overruled at any time by the emperor. It’s true that —as arbitrary autocrats go — Roman emperors generally left ordinary subjects alone. But a benevolent (or merely disinterested) despotism is still a despotism.

On the other hand, the Republic was ultimately run by and for the the benefit of Romans — narrowly defined as citizens of the Roman city state and those who they chose to invite into their club. Rome was pretty good at assimilating foreigners by ancient standards — but at any given point most of the parts of the map you see colored “Roman” in a textbook were not actually inhabited by Romans but by “provincials,” that is, by people who were subjects of the Romans and not Romans themselves.

Ironically it was the despotism of the emperors, not the freedom of the Republic, which really benefitted the provincials. The politics of the Roman Republic were competitive, and like modern politics they ran on money. One of the most common ways of financing a political career in Rome was to squeeze the provincials as hard as possible. The most notorious cases, like that of [Verres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verres), seem to be little more than gangsterism. But relatively upright, honest Romans tended to enrich themselves too: not even [Brutus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus_the_Younger), the “noblest Roman of them all,” was able to resist lining his pockets a lot at the expense of the locals when serving abroad as a governor.

The emperors didn’t have to worry quite so much about impressing their peers in politics: they had no peers. They did, however, have an interest in a smoothly running, efficient and comparatively honest administration in the provinces; if nothing else, they didn’t want potential challengers coming back with a lot of provincial money which might finance a coup. So they stopped using ambitious politicians and turned to middle-class professional administrators, who generally dealt with their provincial charges in a less high-handed and oppressive manner than the representatives of the free Republic had done.

So — if you were a Roman, the Republic was free and the empire was a tyranny in all but name. But if you weren’t the empire was probably a much gentler, more predictable and more humane overlord.
