# Did Europe steal full-rigged ship technology, and maybe even the trade and travel routes, from the Chinese, Indonesians, Indians, Moors and Muslims?

Not to any meaningful degree. “Stealing” is in any case a loaded word, but even without quibbles about terminology the extent of to which Europeans borrowed in this are is not very great.

__Naval technology__ 

European style rigging owes nothing to the Chinese fashion — as the linked image clearly shows, [traditional Chinese rigging relied of fully battened sails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_rig), which are extremely rare in the west. It also uses very little standing rigging — the mainstay (literally and figuratively) of European ship designs.

The typical Chinese hull arrangement is also quite different from the standard western hull — 17th and 18th century European shipbuilders were surprised and impressed by the compartmentalized hulls in larger Chinese ships — but on the other hand Chinese shipwrights in Macau [borrowed European techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorcha_(boat)) starting in the 16th century to build faster ships for safety in pirate-infested waters.

The main possible borrowing is the use of sternpost rudders, which started much earlier in China. However Europeans and Arabs both adopted the sternpost rudder using a different mounting method and around the same time — it’s not clear if this was somehow borrowed from a description of a Chinese original or invented independently.

There is some uncertainty about the origins of the the [lateen sail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateen) — basically, a triangular sail supported by a top yards. Scholars disagree about whether the lateen originates in the Arab shipping of the Indian Ocean or from Roman sailors of the Mediterranean. It may not be a meaningful distinction, since Roman and Arab sailors both operated in the Indian Ocean, sailing the same routes and living in the same ports for several centuries; it’s unlikely that a development in either sea would be completely unknown in the other.

The [compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_compass#Medieval_Europehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_compass#Medieval_Europe) used to be assumed to have reached Europe from China. It is definitely attested in China much earlier than in the European or Islamic worlds. However the oldest known mention of a compass in western Europe is in the 12th century and the oldest known record in the Islamic world is in the 13th, which makes the record of transmission problematic. It’s quite possible that the compass did make its way west from China without leaving a trace in written records; it’s also possible that it was independently discovered in different places. The history of compasses after the 1400’s shows many rounds of reciprocal borrowing between east and west.

__Navigation__ 

As for the trade routes: The oldest record of anyone rounding the Cape of Good Hope is a story in the Greek historian Herodotus, who says a Phoenician crew sailed all the way around Africa starting from the Red Sea in 525 BC. However that voyage was not repeated in antiquity, and the story was usually regarded as a fable.

No one else is recorded passing the cape until [Bartolomeu Dias ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeu_Dias)in 1488 Some people believe Chinese admiral [Zheng He’s ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_He)voyage as saying that his ships passed the cape in the other direction in 1422 — but that depends on a remark of a Venetian cartographer who may or may not be speaking of Zheng He and who does not cite his source. The most common reconstruction gets Zheng He’s fleet no further than Tanzania.

When European ships started to appear in the Indian Ocean again (for the first time since the Arab conquests) they began by following the well established routes which for had generally been in operation for more than a thousand years. However the European sailors quickly developed a new set of routes which made more efficient use of their blue-water sailing skills and bypassed the traditional coast-hugging routes.
