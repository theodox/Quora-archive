As far as ___knowledge___ goes, there’s essentially no overlap at all: my (rusty) Latin and Greek vocabulary, my mental map of primary source material for two thousand years between the Bronze Age and Norman Conquest, and my ability to reel off the names of every Roman emperor for Augusts to Septimius Severus in the correct order without checking notes have contributed just about zilch to the last 30 years of my career in computer graphics. Probably the only “bookish knowledge’ that I use on a regular basis is high school geometry: as I’m typing I’m looking at a sticky note with some barely legible trigonometry notes on it.

However the ___skills___ ____ I learned acquiring all that useless knowledge are invaluable, and I use them every day. I have to learn new things all the time to stay current, whether I’m trying to pick new programming techniques or new industry trends or just trying to communicate clearly with my colleagues. All of that comes directly from the things I learned in school: how to assimilate new information, how to analyzed it from several different perspectives, and how to present it clearly.

Education is not about “information” — it’s about stretching yourself into the kind of person who can deal with information. Not every academic program is good at building those skills and not everybody who goes through the process really grasps the difference between scooping up factoids and actually learning to think.

The hallmark of a real education is that it gives you the ability go on educating yourself. If you’ve learned how to learn you’ll be able switch careers and prosper.
