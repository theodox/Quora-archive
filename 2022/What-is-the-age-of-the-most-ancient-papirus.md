The oldest known papyrus [is a spreadsheet](https://theodox.quora.com/The-worlds-oldest-spreadsheet), the record of an inspector’s visit to [the Red Sea port of Wadi-al-Jarf, Egypt](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/ancient-egypt-shipping-mining-farming-economy-pyramids-180956619/) during the reign of [Khufu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu), the Pharaoh who commissioned the great pyramid.

The papyrus dates to year 27 of Khufu’s reign ([Egyptians used regnal years dates](https://www.quora.com/Its-1250-BC-and-Im-in-Egypt-What-year-would-I-say-it-is-More-broadly-how-were-years-and-calendars-reckoned-in-New-Kingdom-Egypt/answer/Steve-Theodore)) .The ‘low’ date range for Khufu’s reign is 2509–2483 BC, the ‘high’ date is 2609–2584 ([list of estimates here](https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Khufu)) .

At this point in Egyptian history our main chronological evidence comes in the form of various king lists — small differences in recorded reigns lead to a noticeable range of options by the time you get this far back. Luckily for us we know that Inspector Merer, the official who wrote the papyrus, was an important bureaucrat who also worked on the Great Pyramid — so we can cross-check the date against [Carbon-14 dates from the pyramid](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/pyramid/explore/howold2.html#:~:text=There%20has%20been%20radiocarbon%20dating,coming%20out%20about%202%2C600%20B.C.). Those dates tend to come in closer to the high dates, though there are things like “how long did Egyptians season their lumber before using it” which add complexity to that number — better scientific techniques are gradually reducing the level on uncertainty.

So, based on the combination of textual evidence and C14 we can say the oldest papyrus is “about” 4550 years old, with range of maybe +/- 50 years.
