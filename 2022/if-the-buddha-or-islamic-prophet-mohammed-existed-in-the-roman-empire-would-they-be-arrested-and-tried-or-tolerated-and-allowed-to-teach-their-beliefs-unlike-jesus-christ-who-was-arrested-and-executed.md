Pretty much anybody who managed to gain a visible following that bypassed the traditional social hierarchies would be at risk in Roman society. The content of your beliefs mattered very little: it was the mere possibility of any independent social movement gave Roman governments the hives well back into the Republican period. We are, after all, talking about the government that at various times [tried to exterminate Druidism](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Emperor-Claudius-ban-druidism/answer/Steve-Theodore), that [crucified priests of Isis](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D18%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D3%3Awhiston%20section%3D4), that even killed several thousand [worshippers of Bacchus](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/unromantest/chapter/roman-cults/) , not to mention its well-known attitude toward Christians and its [brief flirtation with suppressing Judaism.](https://www.britannica.com/story/what-was-hadrians-relationship-with-his-jewish-subjects)

_A Roman Senatorial decree regarding the measures taken to suppress the cult of Bacchus in 186 BC. It’s characteristically Roman in its combination of remorselessness (the penalty for violations is death), authoritarian traditionalism (rites in honor of Bacchus which have been public in the past are allowed to continue under state supervision) and paranoia about private meetings._ 

What’s remarkable about that list is how diverse the victims of Roman persecution are.

About the only thing these examples had in common was that they provided a structure in which believers met together _in private,_ outside the purview of Roman officialdom. This was anathema to Roman sensibilities. In Roman eyes “real” religion was almost entirely a matter of public observances; this business of meeting in private seemed inherently subversive. When the Cicero set out to describe an ideal Roman city one of his key strictures was _“let no one have private gods—neither new gods nor strange gods, unless publicly acknowledged, are to be worshiped privately.” (_ _[De Legibus, II](https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/cicero-treatise-on-the-laws)_ _)._ The Roman state had no truck with the idea of organized groups meeting in private without a representative of the government present.

In practice these rules were a bit more relaxed for the wealthy and socially well connected: a poetry reading or philosophical symposium for a few well-heeled respectable friends was generally ignored — there were, after all, other means of keeping an eye on any machinations that might crop among the elite. But even there, the state periodically intervened to expel philosophers who became too influential or who were seen as subversive. Famous examples included [Carneades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carneades), [Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger), [Musonius Rufus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Musonius_Rufus), and [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus#Life).

Farther down the social scale, though, it could be dangerous to attract a devoted following large enough to draw the eye of authority. Fortune tellers and astrologers ( “[mathematicians](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/47184/did-roman-jurists-rule-that-to-learn-the-art-of-geometry-and-to-take-part-in-pu)”, as they were categorized in Roman law) were frequently expelled from Rome, particularly in periods when the government sensed popular unease. Unofficial diviners (not, of course, the official augurs of the state religion) were expelled from the city once or twice a generation, whenever a political crisis or a moral panic created the right climate. They always returned, of course, and were frequently patronized by senators and emperors: Romans found the idea of foreseeing the future intensely compelling. But any particular diviner had to be careful not to attract too visible a flock and not to get close to anything that could be construed as a political prediction, lest they end up like these poor fellows:

> Decrees of the Senate were also passed to expel from Italy astrologers and magicians. One of their number, Lucius Pituanius, was hurled from the Rock. Another, Publius Marcius, was executed, according to ancient custom, by the consuls outside the Esquiline Gate, after the trumpets had been bidden to sound.

[Tacitus, Annales 2.32](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D32)

It was particularly dangerous to be a too-visible _foreign_  soothsayer, diviner, or astrologer: while expulsion or exile were the usual penalty for Romans who dabbled in unofficial efforts to predict the future, for foreigners the penalty could be execution.

This posed a commercial problem, since exoticism added a lot of glamor to the would-be keeper of astral secrets: our word _magic_  comes ultimately from the popularity of Persian _[magi](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Magi)_ __ as [knowers of the unknowable in Roman times.](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-ancient-Greeks-know-about-Zoroastrianism/answer/Steve-Theodore) Egyptian, Babylonian, and Etruscan trappings — and, not infrequently, Jewish ones as well — were key stage props for astrologers and soothsayers of all origins. But (not unlike, say, the world of 19th century stage magic) there was a subtle difference between “exotic” and “dangerously foreign.” Crossing that line could be dangerous.

Exactly _how_ dangerous is impossible to quantify.

The Roman state did not recognize an independent private sphere where groups could meet for their own purposes outside the watchful eye of the government. Enforcement, however, was necessarily spotty: the entire Roman empire had twenty times fewer civil servants than modern New York City. So, it was possible for a new religious movement to grow and prosper on the fringes of Roman society until it reached a position of sufficient respectability to be stitched into the crazy-quilt of the state cult. The same [worship of Isis that was attacked so violently by Tiberius in 17 was, only a generation or so later, a very visible and public part of the civic life of Pompeii. ](https://www.unrv.com/culture/isis.php)The cult of Mithras — probably because it spread through the ranks of the army, and was therefore always under the eye of the most effective arm of the state — prospered and was fairly quickly granted official status.

Nonconforming religious expression was generally safer the farther you were from Rome. The first-century wonder-worker [Apollonius of Tyana](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/apollonius-of-tyana/) was a child of privilege. He managed to attract a following in elite circles in Asia Minor, but was nearly put to death by Domitian (significantly, while visiting a friend: “[the boldest of the philosophers, simply because he did not live far away from Rome](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/philostratus-life-of-apollonius/philostratus-life-of-apollonius-7.6-10/)”) ¹. On the other hand the second century thaumaturge [Alexander of Abonuteichus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_of_Abonoteichus) — who may have been a sometime-disciple of Apollonius — built a profitable spiritual empire (a “cult” in the modern sense) which gained enough official recognition to feature on provincial coins. When the famous sceptic Lucian of Samosata tried to prosecute him for attempted murder in a Roman court, the governor instead protected the wealthy and influential cult leader.

So, any charismatic prophet or sage who appeared in the Roman world was essentially at the whims of chance. There was no Roman gestapo hunting out subversives and steaming open papyrus scrolls — but there was also no legal protection for peaceful private assembly on a regular basis. If you were lucky and nobody in your local jurisdiction was out to get you for reasons of their own, you could easily fly below the radar. On the other hand it only took one informer with an agenda to label a purely private community practice as a subversive social movement. In short, almost everything depended on local conditions.

The actual content of your beliefs was generally a secondary consideration, though a long history conferred respectability. Any religious behavior perceived as novel was inherently suspect, while almost anything perceived as “ancient” was presumptively legitimate. Despite [the long and often violent history of Roman - Jewish relations,](https://www.quora.com/Are-the-traditional-accounts-of-Judeo-Greek-Judeo-Roman-relations-pre-Christian-realistic-and-consistent-Why-are-most-sources-Jewish-are-there-detailed-counterparts-from-the-Greek-or-Roman-perspective/answer/Steve-Theodore) the Romans could never _quite_ nerve themselves to completely erase a tradition that they openly despised, since it was clearly ancient. The Romans eradicated Druidism ruthlessly but many Celtic deities were worshipped openly (open-ness being, of course, the Roman guarantee of supervision) during and after the anti-Druidic persecutions.

All things considered, though, a career as a charismatic religious leader in the Roman empire could be very dangerous. Without influential protectors and a desire to be incorporated into to the public and officially sanctioned religious order, the likelihood of a religions innovator surviving to a ripe old age was slim.

For somebody like Mohammed — an innovator and someone out to change the world — the Roman empire was not likely to be a welcoming place.

Gautama Buddha, on the other hand, might have been able to achieve recognition as a philosopher in the self-denying mode of Pythagoras or Porphyry. If his disciples were mostly from the respectable classes and his teaching was conducted mostly in public, he might have been folded in to the broadly tolerated philosophical culture. His teachings posed little direct challenge to the authority of the state — but his skepticism about social hierarchy and willingness to reinterpret traditional religious observances could have led him afoul of Roman officialdom in any number of ways. The Roman state was [extremely hard on the Manichees](https://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/mintimperials/2015/03/31/on-this-day-in-302-diocletian-issued-his-edict-on-manicheanism/), who referenced some aspects of Buddhism in their own writings. The Buddha would almost certainly have been safer in Roman Egypt, a cultural melting pot where Indians were not unknown, than he would have been in Rome itself.



¹ The whole story of Apollonius’ confrontation with the emperor is heavily embroidered at best — but it gives a very vivid flavor of the level of danger that attached to being a charismatic religious figure in proximity to Roman power. You can read it in [Philostratus’s Life of Apollonius starting in Book 7](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/philostratus-life-of-apollonius/philostratus-life-of-apollonius-7.6-10/).
