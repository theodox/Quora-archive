# Why did the statue of Socrates have different facial features than the contemporary Greek statues (straight nose, almond eyes, narrow head)? Didn’t Greeks use idealism?

Socrates was usually depicted with features that were outside the usual aristocratic norms — or, to put it more bluntly, he was supposed to be ugly. Here’s Plato in the [Theaetetos](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/theatu.html):

> “He is no beauty, and you must not be offended if I say that he is very like you; for he has a snub nose and projecting eyes, although these features are less marked in him than in you.”

In the [Symposium](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DSym.%3Asection%3D215b), Plato has another character say this:

> he is likest to the Silenus-figures that sit in the statuaries' shops; those, I mean, which our craftsmen make with pipes or flutes in their hands: when their two halves are pulled open, they are found to contain images of gods. And I further suggest that he resembles the satyr Marsyas. Now, as to your likeness, Socrates, to these in figure, I do not suppose even you yourself will dispute it; but I have next to tell you that you are like them in every other respect.

Here’s an example of a Silenus:

And here’s a fairly run-of-the-mill Socrates from the Roman period.

The Silenus influence, incidentally, is one of the main reasons for the internet subculture of “Black Socrates” claims. In some versions of the Dionysus myth, Silenus raises Dionysus in Africa — many Sileni share characteristics with Greek depictions of Africans, particularly with snub noses and full lips. Silenus probably inherited that depiction to some degree from the Egyptian god [Bes](https://www.ancient.eu/Bes/), another famous mythological tippler with a similar appearance.

However the Silenus-type Socrates is not the oldest variety. There are [two basic types of Socrates portraits](http://www.stoa.org/demos/article_portraits@page=12&greekEncoding=UnicodeC.html). The example above is what’s called a “Type B” and it’s the more common version. “Type A” is rarer but is thought to derive, ultimately, from a work commissioned by Socrates’ friends not long after his death. Here’s a Type A, with less of the Silenus influence:

It’s important to remember that both types were copied by hand down the centuries (mechanical or at least wax-cast copies in bronze were more common in antiquity, but few survive). Thus even in Type A’s there’s a lot of room for artistic imagination. You might compare it to the infinite number of variations which every comic character spawns — every sculptor had their own take but they had to include enough of the stereotype to make the subject recognizable.

Here, incidentally, is one of the handful of mosaics of Socrates (this one’s from the Römisch-Germanisches Museum in Köln). It’s pretty late (~ 375 AD) and here the conventional representation is sanded down to “he’s a bearded philosopher”. It’s a good example of the eventual victory of iconography over portraiture.
