It is possible at most U.S. universities, though the details will differ considerably from program to program. 

Many schools have a Classics department which offers courses and degrees that cover both Greek and Roman antiquity with a focus on languages and literary history -- if you go that route you will get a lot of practice in reading texts in the original languages and understanding them in the context of written tradition. 

On the other hand you can also take a degree in history, usually from a History department. The focus there will be more on the theory and practice of history as an academic discipline: learning how to interpret sources critically, how to coordinate literary evidence with other sources (such as archaeology), and how to apply different historical perspectives, from women's history to economics. 

In general an undergraduate major is mostly a statement of your interests and a kind of general program of study; unless you are planning to go on to a graduate degree and a career in teaching, a degree in Classics or Ancient History won't have much impact on your career -- although having the time to dive deeply into subjects that don't impact your career is a privilege to be cherished.
