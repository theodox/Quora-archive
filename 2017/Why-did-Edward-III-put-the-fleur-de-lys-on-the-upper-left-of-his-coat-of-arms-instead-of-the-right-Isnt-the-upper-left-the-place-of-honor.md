# Why did Edward III put the fleur-de-lys on the upper left of his coat of arms, instead of the right? Isn’t the upper left the place of honor?

He picked up the fleur-de-lys from his formidable mother, [Isabella of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_of_France). When he decided to push his claim the throne of France he started to use her [quarterings](http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/marshalling_and_cadency/quartering.htm) and put the fleur-de-lys in the dexter chief, the place of honor, to stress his claim.

In theory he was supposed to do it the other way— you’re supposed to put the paternal line in that quarter. Edward was attempting to make a point about the strength of his claim to the throne of France, but it was kind of tacky; apparently the Pope tried to persuade Edward to knock it off without success.

Incidentally the practice of quartering arms to a kingdom you don’t rule is known by the very elegant technical name of “[arms of pretension](https://books.google.com/books?id=NjltAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=arms+pretension&source=bl&ots=4dSc9DasqY&sig=6zk-pu_xr4rV-sOBT3FwI9iZci0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQyNvV9vjWAhVcImMKHff9A9UQ6AEISTAL#v=onepage&q=arms%20pretension&f=false)”
