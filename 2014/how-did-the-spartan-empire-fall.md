Sparta "fell" a couple of times. After defeating Athens in the Peloponnesian war, Sparta turned out to be a clumsy great power in Greece. Spartans interfered in local politics all over the Greek world, supporting oligarchic regimes against democracies but also generally trampling on the jealously guarded local rights of the many city-states. Moreover Sparta was happy to cut deals with Persia in order to defeat Athens, which undercut the legitimacy of their traditional role as protectors of the Greeks. All of inclined other states to gang up on Sparta ( Greek politics was always about dragging down anybody who looked too powerful in any case) .

The rise of Thebes, particularly thanks to the brilliant general [Epaminondas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epaminondas), led to a crushing Spartan defeat at the [Battle of Leuctra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leuctra) in 371, which ended the myth of Spartan military invulnerability. However Sparta escaped annihilation with a costly victory at [Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mantinea_%28362_BC%29) where — proof that Greek politics is always "pile on the leader" — they were allied with their former arch-enemy Athens!

Spartan's famous egalitarian and communal discipline crumbled remarkably quickly with all of the opportunities for wealth and power which supreme power brought with it. Over time, class divisions among the Spartiates (the minority of full Spartan citizens) weakened the state: richer citizens could skip out on their military obligations while poorer ones resented fighting to protect the rich. In the Hellenistic period [Agis IV ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agis_IV)and then [Cleomenes III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleomenes_III) tried to restore something of the ancient Spartan discipline, but they were betrayed and murdered by more 'modern' oligarchs. In any case, neither reformer could decisively defeat new threats: the wars of the 3rd century BC saw regional alliances like the [Achaean League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaean_League) and big kingdoms like Macedon replace city-states as the key actors in Greek politics.

In another generation the eccentric king [Nabis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabis) tried to restore Spartan's military greatness. He was more of a charismatic warlord than a legitimate heir to the throne, and by his time Sparta was just a small regional power in a world dominated by Macedonia and Rome. He made this mistake of [picking a fight with the Romans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_against_Nabis) which he lost in short order. When he was assassinated Sparta was forced into the Achaean league, losing its independence forever. Fifty years later, the rest of Greece was turned into a Roman province after the Achaeans tried and failed to push the Romans out.
