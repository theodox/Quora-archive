Not exactly. The Greeks and Romans thought they knew a connection, but we generally think the connection is really the product of the habit of retro-fitting foreign deities into Greek frames of reference rather than a historical or anthropological parallel.

The Lupercalia was a very specifically _Roman_ festival It’s a very Roman rite — in fact, the cave where the Lupercal altar stood was supposedly the place where the wolf suckled the Romulus and Remus.

The most visible expression of the rite was a race run by the _Luperci:_ the naked priests who ran through the streets flailing the crowds with strips of bloody goatskin. Here again the very Roman roots of the rite show through: supposedly their route was supposedly the same course run by Romulus and Remus after their victory over [Amulius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amulius).

The actual etymology of _Lupercalia_  is unclear but it’s clearly connected in some ways to wolves and to Rome’s origin as a pastoral society. Much of early Roman mythology focuses on the self-image of a rough-and-tumble clan of herders — in both Greek and Roman antiquity, shepherds and goatherds were often seen as examples of both rural simplicity and banditry. The Lupercal was thus both a pastoral fertility festival and a Roman patriotic event: it’s probably no accident that the “trial” crowning of Julius Caesar was staged at the Lupercal, a site strongly associated with Rome’s founding. Constantinople — the second Rome — still celebrated [a Greekified and Christianized Λουπερκάλια into the 10th century](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:Platonykiss/%E1%BC%9C%CE%BA%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B9%CF%82_%CF%84%E1%BF%86%CF%82_%CE%92%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85_%CF%84%CE%AC%CE%BE%CE%B5%CF%89%CF%82) !

Greek and Roman observers both noted the Lupercalia’s connection to wolves, and drew a connection to the [Lykaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lykaia), a rural festival from Arcadia in the Peloponnese. [Here’s Plutarch:](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2008.01.0061:chapter=21)

> the name of the [Lupercalia] festival has the meaning of the Greek ‘Lycaea,’ or feast of wolves, which makes it seem of great antiquity and derived from the Arcadians in the following of Evander.

By imperial times the association was regarded as a “settled fact” — but despite this common observation a precise equivalence is actually unlikely and reflects [the obsessive Greek habit of analogizing foreign rites to their own](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-relation-of-Hermes-the-Olympian-Messenger-God-with-Ancient-Egypt-if-any-at-all), not a real historical connection.

To start with, there’s the obvious question: __which god presided over the Lupercalia?__ 

The Romans themselves were not really sure. There was supposedly an image of “Lupercus” in the sacred cave but he’s mentioned by name in only once source and he might merely be an attribute of some other deity. Some Roman authors suggested the god of the Lupercalia was [Inuus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuus), another obscure god associated with sex, or [Liber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber#:~:text=In%20ancient%20Roman%20religion%20and,part%20of%20their%20Aventine%20Triad.), a Roman analogue of Dionysus. Those choices give a bit of the rowdy flavor of the festival.

The Greek Lykaia, on the other hand, was clearly identified with Zeus Lykaios. It was based around a ritual connection with Zeus’s thunderbolt: the chief archaeological evidence for the Lykaia is a giant ash-pile which recalls the thunderbolt that Zeus used to destroy [Lycaon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycaon_of_Arcadia) for trying to trick the god into partaking of human flesh. That connection gave the Lykaia a sombre, even sinister flair: Plato and Pausanias both told rumors of werewolves and ritual cannibalism. [Archaeology suggests that might be a memory of a much older practices on the mountaintop](https://www.livescience.com/55733-possible-human-sacrifice-to-zeus-discovered.html).

The were were some aesthetic overlaps. The Lykaia — in rural Arcadia, where pastoralism remained a way of life quite late — was associated with the protection of flocks from wolves. Mount Lykaion hosted a shrine for Pan, the patron of goatherds and their flocks. We don’t know much about the rites of Pan Lykaios but it’s a safe bet that they included both goat and wolf imagery. However the closest Roman analog for Pan isn’t the obscure Lupercus — it’s [Faunus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faunus), who like Pan was depicted as a half-goat, and was a patron of pastoral fertility.

If there were any historic truth the story of Evander transplanting the rites of Pan, you’d expect Faunus to be part of the Lupercalia. In fact his main feast was December 5 outside of Rome (there was a smaller observance on the Tiber Island on February 13, two days before the Lupercalia). The overlapping imagery in the rituals doesn’t necessarily equate to real connection: the imagination of goatherds everywhere tends to dwell on wolves, on the increase of the flocks, and on the business of chasing around after things.

The strongest case for the treating the Lupercalia and the Lykaia as no more than superficially similar is the the tone.

The Lupercalia was a rowdy festival that — whatever it’s political ties to Rome’s founding — was ultimately about encouraging fertility (there is no ancient source, however, for the often repeated internet claim that the Lupercalia included a kind of sexual lottery). The nakedness, the drinking, and the supposed power of the goat-skin flails to encourage pregnancy all contributed to a party atmosphere. Emperor Augustus, something of a stiff, is believed to have ended the public nudity part — but even in the fifth century the Popes were complaining about the disreputable behavior of the urban masses come Lupercalia time.

The Lykaia, on the other hand, was secretive and broody; even though there’s no evidence for actual human sacrifice in historic times (the one find which may be a human victim dates back to the 2d millennium BC) the place had a dark reputation well into the imperial era.

So: to answer the original question the Greeks and Romans _thought_  there was one — but they were doing what they often did: exaggerating fairly common visual or verbal similarities to create a fictitious connection between Italian and Greek realities.

It occurs to me after reviewing that the OP might just be asking “were there any Greek festivals that were as rowdy and (putatively) sexy as the Lupercalia?”

In that case, you’re looking for the _[komos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komos)_ _,_ the drunken street party that was a part of many different Greek festivals.

However the strong sex-segregation in most Greek cities meant that this was a rowdy drunken party primarily for men and female prostitutes: a kind of public bachelor party.
