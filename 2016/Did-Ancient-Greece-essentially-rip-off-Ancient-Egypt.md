Generally that's a fringe opinion when expressed in that way. 

There are plenty of very well documented ways in which Greek civilization learned from the Egyptians. [Dimitra Triantafyllidou's ](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dimitra-Triantafyllidou)answer includes some of the most obvious things the Greeks picked up from Egypt, from free-standing sculpture to math to the basics of astronomy. Egypt had been a prosperous civilization for two thousand years when Greeks were barely literate; Greece, which always had trouble feeding itself, could only envy the bounty of the Nile and the efficiency of Egyptian agriculture.

Most of the time Greeks themselves were pretty frank about admitting some debts to Egypt -- Herodotus, for example, attributes the basis of Greek religion and many domestic arts to Egypt, for example; Egyptian medicine and astrology (which included real astronomy as well) remained very prestigious throughout Greek and Roman times. It was common to say that a legendary wise man like [Solon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon) or [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) had "visited Egypt" though the details were often pretty hazy. Several widely accepted mythological stories implied that different parts of Greece were actually colonized by Egyptians: theoretically at least the royal family of [Argos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_kings_of_Argos#Danaid_Dynasty)  were descendants of the (otherwise unknown) king "Aegyptus" so familiar Greek characters like [Perseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus) and [Amphiaraus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiaraus) would actually be 'Egyptian'. 

 A lot of 19th century scholarship wanted to believe the Greeks were a unique brand of geniuses who created all sorts of wonderful things in a vacuum. They looked at stories like Solon's visit to Egypt or the Danaid dynasty of Argos as little more than fairy tales. Modern scholarship, backed up by archaeology, sees a more substantial connection between all the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean: the Greeks, after all, didn't get the art of writing from they Egyptians but from the Phoenicians; and they borrowed a lot of their advanced astronomy and geometry from the Babylonians (our planet names, for example, [are probably Babylonian in origin ](https://www.quora.com/Were-the-planets-named-after-Greek-Roman-gods-or-did-the-ancients-believe-the-planets-were-gods)though 'translated' into the names of Greek gods). 

So, it's entirely worth while to look at particular ideas or technologies and see how they crossed borders and bounced around between cultures. However the whole idea of 'rip-off' is essentially a conspiracy theory. 

That kind emotive language is usually an offshoot of a particularly extreme brand of [Afrocentrism. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrocentrism) Proponents generally assumes there were lots of other, undocumented borrowings and influences that were deliberately hidden as a form of systematic denigration of the pure, African Egyptian culture. 

In extreme versions this takes pretty silly forms, like [folks who claim Aristotle cribbed from the Library of Alexandria](http://www.historyplace.com/pointsofview/not-out.htm) (which was in fact organized after his death by his student [Demetrius of Phalerum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_of_Phalerum) -- not to mention the fact that the city itself was founded by his other student, Alexander!) or the idea the Cleopatra -- a very well documented descendant of the invaders who came with Alexander -- was black. In more respectable forms, like the works of [Martin Bernal, ](https://www.quora.com/What-if-any-is-the-part-of-truth-to-Martin-Bernals-Black-Athena)it takes the form of over-playing tenuous links and arguing from silence -- or leaning heavily from very late sources, like Renaissance-era [Hermeticists](http://www.witchcraftandwitches.com/related_hermeticism.html), 18th century [Rosicrucians](https://www.rosicrucian.org/history)  or Roman-era Egyptophiles like [Plutarch.](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html) In either case it's taking a worthwhile idea -- looking for links between contemporary cultures -- and running ahead of the evidence. Sometimes a long way.
