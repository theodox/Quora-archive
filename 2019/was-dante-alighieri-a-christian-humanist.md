Almost.

It’s important to remember that the word “humanist” has been re-purposed since the Renaissance to mean something completely different from what it would have meant to Dante and his contemporaries.

A [renaissance-era humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism) was a professional writer. They were known for their fluent Latin, their mastery of rhetoric, and their familiarity with history and philosophy. Humanists were frequently lawyers, diplomats, and [notaries](https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/notaries): jobs where their literary and rhetorical skills were prized. They took their name from _humanae litterae_ — they studied “human letters”, the writings of secular antiquity, rather than _divinae litterae,_ holy scripture. Although the most famous examples are [Petrarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch) and [Boccaccio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Boccaccio)— both known for their poetry — a more representative example would be someone like [Coluccio Salutati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coluccio_Salutati), who served in a number diplomatic and government posts. He was chancellor of several states — Todi, Lucca and eventually Florence — and also served as a notary in Papal curia.

In modern usage “humanism” is not a professional qualification but a philosophical label, typically applied to outlooks on life which deny the existence (or at least, the relevance) of any supernatural agency. Although you can find people who would still describe themselves as Christian humanists today it sounds odd to modern ears, whereas “secular humanist” is often used as if the two words were interchangeable. The main archaeological record of the older usage is the way we use the word “humanities” for the study of literature, philosophy and history.

When applying the older definition there’s a legitimate question about how well Dante fits the model.

For starters, Dante is a bit early; many of the great rediscoveries which marked the Renaissance came after Dante’s death. For example it’s hard to imagine the typical Renaissance humanist absent the influence of Tacitus, but the _Annales_ were republished probably about a generation after Dante died. It’s fairly common to describe his younger contemporary Petrarch as the “father of Humanism,” but if you look at for example [Wikipedia’s list of Renaissance humanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Renaissance_humanists) you’ll see that Dante (1265–1321) was born more than a century before most of them.

Despite his devotion to Virgil, Dante is deeply invested in “medieval” ideas, both secular and religious: _La Vita Nuova_ is inconceivable without the influence of French troubadors and the tradition of courtly love, just as the _Commedia_ makes no sense without scholastic theology. Perhaps most important of all, Dante’s greatest achievements were in vernacular Italian rather than Latin — even though Petrarch and Boccaccio were both likewise famous for their vernacular works it was always Latin (elegant, precise, and historically classical Latin) which gave a true small-h humanist his prestige.

Lastly, Dante never worked in the diplomatic or curial circles where most humanists flourished; in theory he was an apothecary by trade though that was mostly a legal fiction (in his Florence, only a guild member could participate in politics).

All that said there are still strong reasons to include Dante in the humanist circle. His classical erudition was not up the the standards of professional critics like [Poggio Bracciolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poggio_Bracciolini) or [Lorenzo Valla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Valla) but he was nonetheless extraordinarily well read in literature available to him. His familiarity with Virgil in particular is legendary. Despite the theological concerns at the heart of the _Commedia_ it’s also a work of immense learning on all fronts, from ancient literature to cutting-edge 14th century mathematics and astronomy.

So, he’s kind of borderline case: the last great figure of medieval Italy, or the harbinger of the Renaissance. Or really, both. Dante is like Shakespeare: he transcends the labels we want to pin on him,
