As several other answers have pointed out, there are really two different things going on in an academic or analytical context. 

The first -- and by far the more important! -- is the marshalling of argument and supporting material. That is where the real work lies -- getting hung up on formalities when you are still struggling to frame a thesis is a waste of time. 

The second part of the equation consists of observing the right conventions. The voice appropriate to an academic paper is quite different from one that works in a blog, or even from one that works in journalism. There are often very different tones and unwritten rules (over and above formal guidelines like a style manual) which should be treated with respect. Respect does not mean slavish obedience -- if you know the conventions well you can flout them for effect, as long as you do it deliberately to achieve something you can't achieve any other way: but know the rules before you start breaking them.

The rule against first person voice is usually intended not to prohibit particular pronouns, but to subordinate your subjective voice to the presentation of your arguments. If you find that it's hard to disentangle your writing from a first-person statement that's often a sign that something else is wrong. 

Sometimes, the point you're making isn't strong enough to stand on its own as a piece of analysis and you are trying to eke it out with an expression of emotion. Or, perhaps, the point is simply too vague or undefined to be reduced to a clear set of statements. _It seems to me that there was no way the French could have defeated the Germans in 1940_  conveys only the sense that you haven't got much to say about the Fall of France. _The trauma of the first World War forced France into a completely defensive strategy in the second. Their passive, risk-averse strategy was no match for the mobile tactics of the German Blitzkrieg_ provides some concrete material for the reader to work with -- either as an introduction to more details or as an efficient way of disposing of 3d Republic and moving on to your next point.

The worrisome first-person intrusions stem from a lack of clarity. Those are not the most common kind, however. The most common ones happen when you simply haven't tightened up the language and structure enough to remove the conversational bits and pieces that creep so often. Academic and historical writing is artificial and will often slip backwards into conversational tones if you're not watching carefully. 

For myself, at any rate _(note that tactical switch to first person!)_ I don't worry about the formal tone until I'm close to a final draft. Or, to put it more abstractly: _Constructing an argument and providing evidence are complex and time consuming. Ignoring formal constraints, such as the prohibition on first-person voice, economizes on effort and allows arguments to develop rapidly. Only worry about nuances of language and usage when the subject matter is well in hand._ 

The conventions of formal writing are only a proxy for clear assertions and good data. If you have a good skeleton you'll find that the proper phrasing is easy: if the circumlocutions are too complicated -- or just sound too phony, even to you -- it's symptomatic of a deeper problem with the content.

And.. I know it's old fashioned... but when all else fails spend and hour with [Strunk and White](http://amzn.to/1ISkZe2). The grammatical details may be contentions these days but the focus on clear, declarative sentences never gets old.
