The hard-core answer would be "we don't really know," since most of our evidence is second hand. However it does seem clear that there was not just one reaction, and that the reactions also varied over time -- the Greek occupation of Egypt lasted over 300 years and the Roman/Byzantine period lasted for another 600 after that; by the time of the Arab conquest Egypt had been under foreign rule for more than a millennium:

The Greeks never quite figured out how they felt about their roles as conquerors. They were notoriously chauvinistic (their world was divided into only two camps: Greeks and "barbarians") but at the same time they were conscious that their culture was younger and in many ways less sophisticated than that of their subjects. The most well known Egyptian writer from the Hellenistic period whose works survive, [Manetho, ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/1*.html)seems to have tried to leverage that acknowledgement by positioning Egypt -- through its gods -- as the ultimate origin of many of the arts and sciences. Writing in the 3rd century BC he exploits the Greek tradition, going back at least as far as Herodotus, that saw Greece as a kind of inheritor Egyptian ideas. For a colonized Egyptian it would be only natural to take that fact and run with it as a way of asserting dignity in the face of foreign occupation. You can certainly see the same impulse in other non-Greek Hellenistic writers like [Philo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo), [Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus) and the Babylonian [Berossus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berossus): a desire to show both that your own culture has a long and rich history of its own but also that it can be reconciled with 'modern' Greek philosophical views. This is a project that would seem instantly familiar to many modern colonial or post-colonial writers.

> __Edit__ : this post used to contain an image of a statue identified as Manetho. The original citation I used has disappeared from the internet, and now this page was coming up as the first image result for Manetho after the (unrelated) header image from Wikipedia.

> Until I can re-find the original image and provenance I’m taking it out. I thought of replacing it with an image of the original text — but since the original text exists entirely in quotations from later authors the images floating around on the net (eg, [this one](https://alchetron.com/Manetho)) are by definition not correct.

Outside the literary world, Egyptians also found ways to leverage the antiquity of their civilization. They had a reputation with Greeks and Romans for mysticism, other-worldly wisdom and magical skills., so many enterprising Egyptians (or pseudo-Egyptians) used those stereotypes to their advantage, Egyptian healers, soothsayers, and oracles were much sought after: After the Romans occupied Egypt, for example, the cult of Isis spread through much of the Empire; this image (complete with shaven-headed priests

comes from Pompeii. Many non-Egyptian writers r[e-cast traditional Egyptian beliefs for a wider audience,](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html) and while there seems to be a good deal of misinformation in those projects there were clearly some Egyptians involved as informants and popularizers; the analogy to the way Indian religious thought spread in the British empire is obvious.

Of course, not everybody wanted to play along. Manetho was priest, and thus effectively a paid employee of the Ptolemies. The [Oracle of the Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_of_the_Potter) and the [Demotic Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_Chronicle) are examples of anti-Ptolemaic literature that circulated periodically. They have a clear nationalistic slant and are rooted in Egyptian literary tradition (not, like Manetho, trying to reach a non-Egyptian audience) -- but they aren't actual revolutionary tracts. Practically oriented resistance movements [did exist](http://did exist) up through the 2d century BC, but they faded away as the Hellenistic system became more and more entrenched. Eventually independence was almost mythical: by the time Augustus absorbed the Ptolemaic Egypt in 30 BC, the country had been under foreign rule for something like 450 of the previous 500 years.

For most of that long period the old, extremely conservative Egyptian tradition also continued on: many Egyptians found it more congenial to continue with the hallowed form of the past: temples continued to be built, inscriptions in the old manner continued to be written, and many literary and religious forms continued on.

Over time, though, the bulk of the Egyptian population lost touch with those old traditions. By the 3d century AD (after 600 years of Greco-Roman occupation, and 800 years since Cambyses) no-one in Egypt could read hieroglyphics with confidence and the demotic written language was giving way to Coptic. This gradual hollowing out of Egyptian traditions -- fading slowly rather than being actively suppressed -- may also be why Egypt very quickly and enthusiastically embraced Christianity.

Ptolemaic Egypt was generally more 'multicultural' than the other Greek kingdoms. As [Kathryn Chew](https://www.quora.com/profile/Kathryn-Chew)'s excellent answer points out the Ptolemies made many gestures to conciliate their Egyptian subjects. There is a lot of evidence (for example, the [Oxyrhynchus papyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyrhynchus), a huge rubbish dump of paperwork for the Roman-Egyptian bureaucracy) shows a high degree of mixing, including families where some children bore Greek and others Egyptian names; citizens with Greek names worshipping at Egyptian temples and Egyptians serving in the bureaucracy and army. The lines between Egyptian and Greek were fluid, particularly at the lower end of the social spectrum.

_A letter in Greek and Demotic from Apollonios (a Greek name) to his brother Tothoes (an Egyptian name) shows how traditions mixed in individual families_ 

Even so, the occupiers never forgot who was in charge. The Ptolemies aggressively recruited foreigners -- not just Greeks but also Thracians, Persians, and particularly Jews -- to help administer their empire and (not too subtly) to counterbalance the Egyptian population. Much of Egypt remained fairly homogenous, but the key strategic sites (particularly Alexandria) were ethnically mixed and very diverse. They were also the scenes of frequent communal conflicts: riots between Greeks, Egyptians and Jews were a constant threat in Alexandria and on several occasions Egypt descended into open warfare between the communities. Again, this would be sadly familiar to many other colonial societies where imperial powers played off different groups against each other to retain power.
