I don’t think we have a written copy of the Punic word for “Rome”. It was probably pretty close to “Rumi”, or possibly “hRumi” — In Aramaic and Syriac the pronunciation was in that range, and Punic remained fairly close to its Semitic roots.

We have a hard time being certain since the overwhelming majority of Punic or neo-Punic inscriptions are personal -most of them are either tombs or religious dedications (“so and so dedicated this statue to Uni,” = Juno, etc) so the vocabulary is pretty limited However to give an example of the Punic approach to exonyms, the Carthaginian side of the [Pyrgi Tablets ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrgi_Tablets)__tbryʼ wlnš mlk ʻl kyšryʼ,__ which is translated as _“Tiberius Velianas who reigns over the_ _[Caerites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caere)_ _.”_ Where Caerites (“Cisra” in Etruscan) are the inhabitants of Caere, one of Rome’s rivals in that period . Much later, funerary and civic inscriptions from the Roman period in north africa show the same general approach to foriegn names, that is, rough transliteration: [Late Punic Epigraphy](https://books.google.com/books?id=h7NJJHNt-g4C&lpg=PA94&ots=QITd-7A798&dq=Zliten%20LP1%2C&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=false)

Unfortunately there are not a good collection of searchable inscriptions online so there may be something out there I’ve missed. There might be something hiding in [Latino-Punic Epigraphy](https://books.google.com/books?id=CewSLElhE8gC&lpg=PA10&ots=cUMsnN7l5J&dq=latino%20punic%20epigraphy&pg=PA16#v=onepage&q=latino%20punic%20epigraphy&f=false) (ie, inscriptions in Latin characters but Punic language). __update__ : buried in a footnote in that reference is _‘wgsts ‘whrm “of Augustus and of Rome…”_ which seems to come an inscription in Lepcis Magna but is not online anywhere — it’s Lepcis Magna N 14.
