The grandaddy of all is _morituri te salutant: “_ we who are about to to die salute you” — the gladiator’s salute.

_si vis pacem, para bellum_ “If you want peace, prepare for war”

_debellare superbos_  “to bring down the arrogant with war”

_divide et impera, “_ divide and rule”

_aut Caesar, aut nihil_ “[I will be] either Caesar — or nothing”

_hic manebimus optime_ , “we’ll stay here — excellently” — when Camillus talked the Senate out of abandoning the city in the face of the Gallic invasion.

If you really want to go their, you kneel with one hand on the ground and the other pointing to the sky, You say _Tellus, Jupiter._ Then you make a suicidal charge, having dedicated yourself — and the enemy — as sacrifices to the gods below and those above.
