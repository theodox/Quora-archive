# Is the word ἀναίτιος (guiltless, innocent) a compound of α + αἰτία (cause) and so does it have the sense of “not the origin or cause of”?

According to the [the Great Scott](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=a)nai/tios), that’s basically it. ‘

You might need to check the context before translating, since [αἴτιος](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ai%29%2Fti-os&la=greek&can=ai%29%2Fti-os0#lexicon) has the double meaning of “physical cause” and “morally or criminally responsible.” We have almost the same double meaning in English, where “cause” means physical causation but also the ground of a legal case.

You could also translate it as “unmotivated” in the sense of “having no cause,” or “spontaneous”
