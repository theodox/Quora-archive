For several centuries the cultural influences were primarily going from Egypt to Europe, not the other way. However what most people think of as “Ancient Egypt” was already in terminal decline by the time that Greeks and Romans became significant historical actors. Egypt was partially conquered by the [Libyans ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Dynasty_of_Egypt)in 945 BC, then completely by the [Nubians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt)from 744 to 656 BC. The Nubian dynasty in turn was driven out by the [Assyrians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Dynasty_of_Egypt)in 664, though the Egyptians managed to expel them again within a generation.

The newly-independent Egyptians actually tried to recruit Greek help after they escaped from the Assyrian yoke. Pharaoh [Psamtik I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psamtik_I) invited Greek merchants and more importantly Greek mercenaries to settle in the city of [Tahpanhes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahpanhes) some time around 650 BC. A couple of generations later a much larger and more permanent city was created at [Naucratis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naucratis) These contacts created a strong diplomatic and cultural relationship between Egypt. Egypt began employing Greeks as soldiers and overseas traders, while Greeks borrowed Egyptian inventions like geometry and free-standing sculpture.

__Greek Period__ 

In the seventh and sixth centuries BC, Egypt loomed very large in Greek imagination — the wealth and sophistication of Egyptian society was truly remarkable to the Greeks.

However Egypt’s wealth did not translate into military might, and in 525 BC Egypt was conquered yet again, this time by [the Persian empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Dynasty_of_Egypt). The Persians would rule Egypt from 525 to 404, and then again from 343 to 332.

332 was a critical date for Egypt’s relationship with Greece — that’s when Alexander the Great took Egypt from the Persians. Thanks in part to the traditional deference Greeks afforded to Egypt — and in part to the political value of conciliating the Egyptians, who were ardently anti-Persian — Alexande[r made a great point of respecting Egyptian traditions and in particular the authority of the Egyptian religious hierarchy](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised).

For the next three centuries, Egypt would be ruled by Greeks, the descendants of Alexander’s general [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter). The relationship was [complicated on a number of levels](https://www.quora.com/How-did-Ancient-Egyptians-view-themselves-after-centuries-of-Hellenisation). In some ways it resembled the British Raj in India, with a separate ruling “caste” of Greeks monopolizing political and military power . In other ways it was a multicultural melange — the ruling dynasty encouraged a certain degree of [fusion between Greek and Egyptian traditions](https://www.quora.com/What-religion-did-the-Ptolemaic-dynasty-of-Egypt-follow) as an aid to political unity. Some wealthy Egyptians, by adopting Greek manners and education, managed to assimilate into the ruling classes; many Greek settlers adopted aspects of traditional Egyptian beliefs. Greek writers [incorporated traditional Egyptian tales and chronicles](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1A*.html) into their histories; [Egyptians, writing in Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho), tried to present their history and beliefs in forms that would garner respect in the wider Greek world.

_Ptolemy and his successors adopted the imagery of the Pharaohs when it was useful — though he never learned Egyptian_ 

The rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt was not an equal partnership. The Greeks were willing to admire aspects of Egyptian culture without ceasing to believe in the superiority of their own. It’s very telling that Cleopatra — the last Greek queen of Egypt — was the only member of her family who ever learned to speak Egyptian.

__Roman period__ 

All of this happened before Rome became a factor — Rome only became relevant in in the eastern Mediterranean in the second century BC, after the defeat of Carthage and Macedonia.

Rome’s rise coincided with the slow-motion implosion of the Greek Egyptian kingdom. A series of incompetent rulers and civil wars left Ptolemaic Egypt extremely weak — it was only Roman intervention that saved Egypt from conquest in 168 BC when a Roman ambassador [stopped an invading Syrian army by drawing the proverbial “line in the sand”. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Popillius_Laenas)The weakened Ptolemaic dynasty could not avoid involvement in Roman politics, as competing factions attempted to leverage Roman support against their rivals — Cleopatra’s affairs with Julius Caesar and Marc Antony were the last and most ambitious examples, but not the only ones. Unfortunately for her, she backed the wrong Romans: when Marc Antony was defeated by the soon-to-be emperor Augustus, the Ptolemies lost their kingdom and Egypt became part of the Roman empire, in 30 BC.

Roman rule in Egypt began as a thin overlay on top of the existing Greco-Egyptian synthesis. Roman governors and soldiers replaced Greek ones, but the cities remained primarily Greek and the countryside mostly Egyptian. Where the Ptolemies had replaced the native Pharoahs, now the Caesars did the same.

In the first century or two of the Roman period there was a wave of “Egyptomania” in Italy and the Greek-speaking provinces of the eastern empire, leading to things like the [Pyramid of Cestius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Cestius) in Rome and the [Temple of Isis in Pompeii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Isis_(Pompeii)). One of the most famous novels in Latin, the _[Golden Ass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Ass)_  of Apuleius, is about a Greek merchant who finds salvation at the hands of Isis.

However Egypt itself was undergoing a fairly rapid change throughout the first centuries of the Roman period. Although the worship of Isis, in particular, did well outside of Egypt the traditional state religion was in decline; in the cosmopolitan context of a vast empire, Egypt’s traditional inward focus was much harder to maintain. The temples were still supported by the Roman state, but on a less lavish scale. The element of ruler worship, which went back to the oldest Pharaohs, declined when the ruler in question rarely if ever set foot in Egypt.

The ongoing process of intermarriage and the ongoing influence of Greek (and to a lesser extent, Roman) ideas also diluted the vitality of the traditional outlook. Even the ancient tradition of hieroglyphic writing declined — although the last known hieroglyphic inscription dates to the year 394, Greek and Roman discussions of hieroglyphics show that the knowledge was already fading in the third century. Ordinary Egyptians also abandoned the less formal forms of native writing in favor of the Greek alphabet: today’s Coptic is the language of ancient Egypt, written in a Greek-derived alphabet.

_A Coptic Bible from the third century_ 

Perhaps for this reason, Egypt was one of the earliest parts of the empire to embrace Christianity, long before the religion was even legal in the Roman world. Alexandria became one of the major centers of Christian scholarship. The early Christian theologian [Origen ](https://www.iep.utm.edu/origen-of-alexandria/)is a perfect example of the mixed intellectual life of Egypt around the year 200 — his works features a mix of Biblical teachings, Platonic philosophy, and a doctrine of reincarnation that seems to owe a lot to traditional Egyptian ideas, reflecting the complex multicultural world of Roman Egypt.

Egypt was a Roman province for almost seven centuries — a long time for the complex mix of cultures to mix and meld. It’s not really possible to split out ‘Greek’ and ‘Roman’ influence in Egypt, since the language and culture of the Roman east were mostly Greek but many important aspects of Greek culture in the Roman period were themselves only possible in an imperial, rather than a strictly Greek context. Strictly Latin cultural influence was fairly limited — when we find papyri from the Roman period they are only rarely in Latin. On the other hand the evolution of the Coptic Church was only possible in the cosmopolitan context of the Roman empire — to this day the Copts use the calendar of Roman emperor Diocletian.

To sum up — there’s not an easy way to really answer this as an ‘either-or’ question; it’s really more ‘both-and’
