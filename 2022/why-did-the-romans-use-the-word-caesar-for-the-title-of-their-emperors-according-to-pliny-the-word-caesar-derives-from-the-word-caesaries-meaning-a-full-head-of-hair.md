# Why did the Romans use the word Caesar for the title of their emperors? According to Pliny, the word ‘Caesar’ derives from the word caesaries meaning ‘a full head of hair’.

This one touches on two different, both eminently Roman things at the same time.

__The first part is the origin of the name “Caesar.”__ 

Caesar started off as a “cognomen”, a kind of inheritable nickname. Roman names were originally similar to our own: a first name followed by a clan name. The person we know as “Julius Caesar” was actually __Gaius__ _(personal name)_ __Julius__ _(clan name)_  to his contemporaries. However Rome as Rome grew the stock of clan names was too small: there were fewer than two hundred over all, and many of those were pretty rare or obscure. Thus, you might wander into the Forum and call “where’s Gaius Julius?” and get several people raising their hands.

So, the Romans began augmenting the clan names with additional markers that distinguished different branches of the same clan. These third names (in Latin, [cognomens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognomen)) were effectively inheritable nicknames: they were typically assigned at some point based on a distinguishing personal characteristic of some individual but they came to refer to his descendants as well… at least until one of them was so notable that he and his own descendants acquired a different cognomen. There were no formal rules, which leads to a good deal of confusion for people trying to trace Roman family histories.

In any case, the famous __Gaius Julius Caesar__  descended from other [Julii Caesares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julii_Caesares), but these were a fairly late-emerging branch of the Julian clan — the first recorded person to hold that name was Sextus Julius Caesar, a general in the Punic Wars about 100 years before the famous Caesar was born. Even the Romans were not completely sure what “Caesar” signified: There were four different explanations floating around in antiquity:

from _caesus_ , “cut” — perhaps related to the [legendary origin-story of the Caesarian section](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/cesarean/part1.html).

from _caesius, “blue-gray” —_ presumably a Julius with piercing blue eyes.

from _caesaries,_ “flowing” or “luxuriant” hair. Perhaps from a particularly vain Julius known for his locks, or perhaps from a baby born with an unusual amount of hair. It could also be a sarcastic name for a family prone to baldness: it was not unheard of for cognomens to be somewhat insulting.

from a supposed foreign word for an elephant which a Julius had killed on the battlefield in Africa. This one is regarded as especially dubious.

Opinion today is remains divided, though #3 is regarded as the likeliest origin. That one was a bit of pain for the historical Gaius Julius Caesar, who was notoriously touchy about his hair loss as he aged.

_This is probably the_ _[only lifetime portrait of Caesar](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-busts-of-Caesar-that-were-created-within-his-lifetime-that-still-exist/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=265375559&share=21efd2bd&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer)_ _— most of the ones in museums are extremely flattering ones done after his death by order of his adoptive son and political heir, emperor Augustus. Those tend to show a younger and more hirsute Caesar; this one shows how much forehead he was sporting by the time of this assassination._ 

All of which explains where the name Caesar comes from and why it _might_ mean “hairy” even if the most famous owner of the name sported a serious comb-over.

__As to why it came to mean emperor:__ well, that has to do with the fact that Roman self-image was extremely hostile to one-man rule. “King” was a dirty word in Rome, so even when Gaius Julius Caesar (and later his adopted son, the future emperor Augustus, who took the same name) became the sole ruler of the Roman world it was important to pretend that whatever they might be, they _were not kings. Nope. No sir, not kings._ 

Since formal Roman manners were reminiscent of 19th century British ones — you often addressed your peers by surname rather by their given names — being able to address the ruler of the Roman world as “Caesar” preserved a figleaf of Roman equality in what was, in fact, a dictatorship. That habit lasted long enough to lost its original meaning and to morph into a formal title which remained in use in one way or another, for more than a thousand years.
