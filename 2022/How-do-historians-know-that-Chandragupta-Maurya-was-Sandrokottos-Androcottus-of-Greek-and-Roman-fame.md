Above all, the timing works out pretty well.

The surviving long source for “Sandracottus” is [Justin, 15.4](http://www.attalus.org/translate/justin1.html#15.4):

> After the division of the Macedonian empire among the followers of Alexander, [Seleucus] carried on several wars in the east. He first took Babylon, and then, his strength being increased by this success, subdued the Bactrians. He next made an expedition into India, which, after the death of Alexander, had shaken, as it were, the yoke of servitude from its neck, and put his governors to death. The author of this liberation was Sandrocottus, who afterwards however, turned their semblance of liberty into slavery; for, making himself king, he oppressed the people whom he had delivered from a foreign power, with a cruel tyranny. This man was of mean origin, but was stimulated to aspire to regal power by supernatural encouragement; for, having offended Alexander by his boldness of speech, and orders being given to kill him, he saved himself by swiftness of foot; and while he was lying asleep after his fatigue, a lion of great size having come up to him, licked off with his tongue the sweat that was running from him, and after gently waking him, left him. Being first prompted by this prodigy to conceive hopes or royal dignity, he drew together a band of robbers, and solicited the Indians to support his new sovereignty. Some time after, as he was going to war with the generals of Alexander, a wild elephant of great bulk presented itself before him of its own accord, and, as if tamed down to gentleness, took him on its back, and became his guide in the war, and conspicuous in fields of battle. Sandrocottus, having thus acquired a throne, was in possession of India, when Seleucus was laying the foundations of his future greatness; who, after making a league with him, and settling his affairs in the east, proceeded to join in the war against Antigonus.

(Appian gives a similar but much shorter account [here](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/appian/appian-the-syrian-wars/appian-the-syrian-wars-11/); Plutarch tells a version of this story [here](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/9.html), using _Andracottus_ ).

The “eye-witness” testimony is the [Megasthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megasthenes), whose work survives only in fragments but who was said to have been an ambassador to _Sandrocottus_ and to have visited _Palibothra_  — presumably, [Palipatura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pataliputra) — multiple times.

All of this lines up pretty well with Chandragupta.

_Palibothra_ is a pretty good stab at _Palipatura_ for a Greek speaker. Palipatura was definitely the Mauryan capital under [Ashoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka), so it’s not much of a stretch to assume it was his grandfather’s capital as well. _Σανδράκοττος, Sandracottos w_ as the best a Greek scribe could reasonably manage for _Chandragupta —_  Greek lacks a good way of writing or saying the sound we use in English for “cheese,” and a sigma is about as close as you’d expect. _Ανδράκοττος Andracottus_  is an easy scribal slip up for an uncommon name.

There’s clearly some folkloristic elements in Justin and Plutarch’s stories — or perhaps, vestiges of Mauryan propaganda. Nevertheless the more prosaic bits put us right in the vicinity of 305 BC, about 20 years after Alexander’s campaigns. Seleucus’ unsuccessful effort to recapture the Indus territories has to happen between 309 (the end of his war to control the satrapy of Babylon) and 301 (When Seleucus deployed the Indian elephants that were part of his treaty with “Sandracottus” at [Ipsus](https://www.livius.org/articles/battle/ipsus/)).

The combination of the pretty good naming, the geographical location, and the date range all point to Chandragupta from the Greek side. On the Indian side, It’s worth noting that at least [one Hindu account of Chandragupta ](http://hinduonline.co/Scriptures/Puranas/BhavishyaPurana.html)includes mentions that he married a daughter of “Suluva” the Yavana [=Greek] king of Pausasa [=Persia]. A late historical drama, the _[Mudrarakshasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudrarakshasa)_ _,_ includes Yavanas in Chandragupta’s armies. And, of course the [Kandahar Greek Edicts of Ashoka ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_Greek_Edicts_of_Ashoka#:~:text=The%20Kandahar%20Greek%20Edicts%20of,Farsi)%20in%20Kandahar%20in%201963.)provide direct evidence for the interaction of Chandragupta’s grandson and successor-king with Greek communities in the Indus Valley.

Against that background, positing an additional king with a similar name and an army large enough to spare 500 elephants seems like a lot of unnecessary work.

I should however mention for completeness sake mention that there is a version of these events in which sees Seleucus interacting with a different king named [Samudragupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samudragupta) — who, in more conventional chronology, is said to have ruled about _six hundred and fifty years later_ . This is, of course a complete rewrite of the conventionally accepted chronology of both India and the Greek world.
