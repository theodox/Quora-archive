I’d say be very careful before putting a lot of money into a game-related degree.

Most schools will give you useful technical information and an introduction to the games business. What they usually cannot give, though, is a significant leg up in the hiring process. The games business is not very credential oriented: there is no degree in the games world that performs like an MBA from Harvard. This fact can be made worse if the school in question isn’t particularly tied to the industry: in the US it’s quite hard to find games jobs outside of LA, SF, Seattle and maybe Austin so schools far from those centers are at a disadvantage.

Without a real connection to local companies, the degree is primarily about technical skills and — given the shameful over-inflation of education prices in the states — it’s definitely worth seeing if you can put together your own course of study with online resources.

On the plus side, games is extremely open to people with alternative backgrounds as long as you’ve got something to show. A successful indie game, a killer demo reel, or a high-profile role in a successful open source project are all things that will attract positive attention from most developers.
