# Why was Trajan the last Roman emperor to build a forum in Rome even though he was followed by several successful emperors at the peak of the Roman Empire?

Creating new open space in the center of Rome was very expensive and complicated; there was not a lot of flat open ground left by the second century. Rome was very dense — it was a mostly a city of tightly-packed multi-story _insulae_ , with shops on the ground floor and apartments above. Main streets were mostly four or five meters wide, but in lesser avenues you could probably touch the buildings one both sides with your outstretched arms. The fora were prestigious spaces in part because they were comparatively open in a city that was often quite claustrophobic.

_This map shows the main hills of Rome with the forum at center. Trajan’s forum is a bit north of the legend ‘Argil.’ — short for the Argiletum, which was the main northern entrance into the city’s ritual center. As you can see the hills define the possible places to expand the fora._ 

Trajan was probably only able to build his forum — and [the market which went with it](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/ancient-mediterranean-ap/ap-ancient-rome/a/forum-and-market-of-trajan), probably to provide a place for various businesses and offices displaced by the construction — because he was flush with cash. His victory over the Dacians in 106 provided something like 150 million sesterces worth of gold and silver, a significant fraction of the entire budget of the empire. As Aulus Gellius noted:

> ]All along the roof of the colonnades of the forum of Trajan gilded statues of horses and representations of military standards are placed, and underneath is written _Ex manubiis_  [from the spoils of war] ...”

As it was the forum could only be constructed by cutting into the slopes of the Quirinal and removing a rise which connected it to the Capitol hill. probably near where the Vittorio Emmanuele monument is today.

The building of Trajan’s market — which is one of Rome’s under-appreciated marvels — set the direction for future public construction in Rome. The innovative use of concrete barrel vaults enabled the creation of tremendous enclosed spaces, larger than those possible with traditional columnar masonry construction. The future marvels of Rome would not be big open spaces but towering vaulted structures. The most obvious example is the Basilica of Maxentius, at the other end of the Forum. Today only about a third of the structure is still standing (most of it was destroyed in a medieval earthquake) but it still dominates the forum.

So — in this way, as in many others, Trajan’s forum represents the high-water mark of the empire: the zenith of its wealth and power but also the end of the uses of space and materials which characterized the Rome of the Republic and early empire.
