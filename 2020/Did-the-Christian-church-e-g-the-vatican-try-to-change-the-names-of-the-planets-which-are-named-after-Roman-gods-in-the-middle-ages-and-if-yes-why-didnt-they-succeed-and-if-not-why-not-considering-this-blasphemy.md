# Did the Christian church (e.g. the vatican) try to change the names of the planets (which are named after Roman gods) in the middle ages, and if yes, why didn't they succeed, and if not, why not (considering this "blasphemy" from a christian view)?

If they tried it they weren’t very good at it.

This is an astronomical diagram from a [10th century copy of Bishop Isidore of Seville’s De Rerum Natura](https://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2016/07/star-item-an-anglo-saxon-sketch-of-the-solar-system.html). If you look at Isidores’ names in the image above they are (from center out) _Luna, Mercurius, Lucifer, Sol, Vesperus, Faeton, Saturnus._ Lucifer is the old native Roman reference for Venus, the identification with the goddess came later from Greek astronomy. Isidore does however provide Venus, Mars and Jupiter in the accompanying text:

> Their Greek names are Phaethon, Phaenon, Pyrion, Hesperus, and Stilbon. 21. The Romans have consecrated them with the names of their gods, that is, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. Themselves deceived, and wishing to deceive others into the worship of those who had granted them something in accordance with their desires, they would point out the stars in the sky, and say that this one was Jupiter’s and that one was Mercury’s, and this vain belief was born. The devil strengthened this erroneous belief, and Christ overturned it.

Otherwise, the use of the familiar names was universal:

_A typical medieval astronomical diagram. From the center are the four elements (earth, water, air, and fire) followed in order by luna, mercurius, venus, sol, mars, jupiter, saturnus, and coel. stelat. “the starry heavens”._ 

As for it being “blasphemous” the only serious concern that the medieval church had with astronomy was with its ancient connection with astrology.

Astronomy — as an observational science and one which medieval thinkers generally saw as reflecting the harmony of an orderly universe — was not controversial; every medieval university taught astronomy as part of the [Quadrivium,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium) the medieval equivalent of graduate studies. However, many of the Greek and Roman texts which the dominated the medieval curriculum included elements of astrology which posed a tricky problem for medieval thinkers. That the heavens exercised some kind of influence on earthly affairs was taken for granted: astronomy, after all, was an eminently practical science for farmers or sailors who needed to know when to plow or when it would be safe to set sail. However the line between that kind of practical knowledge, fortune-telling, and complete philosophical determinism was always fuzzy. If you take astrological thinking to its logical extremes, everything here on earth becomes predetermined and free will is impossible, a conclusion which the church really did regard as heretical.

The tension between reverence for the “scientific” authority of Greco-Roman texts and suspicion of astrology was never really resolved: a copy of Pliny or Ptolemy was an expensive luxury, and a serious scholar would not want one which had been edited to remove suspicious astrological material for fear of missing out on something important. Because Greco-Roman and later Arabic medicine [included such a heavy dose of astrological material ](https://www.bl.uk/learning/cult/bodies/astrology/astrologyhome.html)it was impossible to suppress astrological material; every medieval doctor carried a star chart as standard equipment. The best the church was able to do was to insist on the difference between the mechanical influence of the stars and planets on matter and the ability of the human mind to overcome that influence, though it was a long running fight that was never really concluded.

_A page from the_ _[guild book of the Barber-Surgeons of York in the British Library](https://www.bl.uk/the-middle-ages/articles/medicine-diagnosis-and-treatment-in-the-middle-ages)_ _, providing astrological reference for the would-be doctors._ 

Medieval people did not share our enlightened modern attitudes about history: older works were regarded as extremely precious even when their conclusions weren’t congenial. Most famously, Aristotle’s formal logic formed the solid core of most medieval theological systems despite the fact that many of his core beliefs were flatly contradictory to Church teachings. In those barbaric, information-starved times people were forced read books they disagreed with. Entire medieval scholarly careers were built on extracting value out of Greek, Roman or Islamic works that were regarded as erroneous.

_A page from the_  _[San Pietro manuscript of Pliny’s Natural History in the Vatican.](https://digi.vatlib.it/mss/detail/Arch.Cap.S.Pietro.C.131)_ _This was copied for the library of St. Peter’s basilica between about 1375 and 1400._ 

Here’s the reality of medieval censorship: the image above is a page from Pliny’s [Natural History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) — the standard “science encyclopedia” of the Middle Ages. The copy above is from the Vatican Library. This passage at lower right is available in its entirety [here](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D5), but these are a few highlights:

> with respect to Jupiter and Mercury, and the rest of the celestial nomenclature, who does not admit that they have reference to certain natural phænomena? But it is ridiculous to suppose, that the great head of all things, whatever it be, pays any regard to human affairs. Can we believe, or rather can there be any doubt, that it is not polluted by such a disagreeable and complicated office? It is not easy to determine which opinion would be most for the advantage of mankind, since we observe some who have no respect for the Gods, and others who carry it to a scandalous excess…

> Among these discordant opinions mankind have discovered for themselves a kind of intermediate deity, by which our scepticism concerning God is still increased. For all over the world, in all places, and at all times, Fortune is the only god whom every one invokes; she alone is spoken of, she alone is accused and is supposed to be guilty; she alone is in our thoughts, is praised and blamed, and is loaded with reproaches; wavering as she is, conceived by the generality of mankind to be blind, wandering, inconstant, uncertain, variable, and often favouring the unworthy.

If you’re going to use this as your standard reference work, piddling around with the names of the planets is a poor use of your time as an evil control freak.
