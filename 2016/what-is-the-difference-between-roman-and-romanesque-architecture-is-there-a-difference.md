‘Roman’ architecture is the architecture of the Roman republic and empire. There are several distinct sub-genres, from the familiar aqueducts and temples to the more substantial but less famous basilicas. Generally Roman architecture is characterized by a strong Greek influence (columns using the classical orders and pediments, for example) combined with Roman innovations in arches, barrel vaults, and free standing domes. A lot of Roman architecture relies on concrete.

‘Romanesque’ architecture is a descendant of later Roman architecture. Most of the Greek ornamentation is lost, and there’s a stronger emphasis on arched vaults and more solid forms. As time goes on Romanesque gets to be more vertical than most Roman architecture as well. There’s very little concrete construction: masonry and brick are the dominant materials.

Usually “Roman” architecture fades into “Romanesque” sometime between the years 500 and 1000. Because Romanesque is a continuation of Roman - like Italian is a continuation of Latin — there’s no single hard dividing line.

Romanesque.

TLDR: “Roman” is classical; “Romanesque” is medieval, but without the pointy arches and frilly bits of high Gothic.
