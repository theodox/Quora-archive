In classical Greek there is a word __[φιλοστοργία](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=fi%5Elostorg-i%2Fa&la=greek&can=fi%5Elostorg-i%2Fa0)__ __,__ meaning “affection” or “fondness” (or sometimes, “sex”) . But there is no φιλοσογία (which would require a σογία or σογη, neither of which exist either.

Not sure about modern Greek, but a casual web search turns it up in a few places where it’s clearly a misspelling of φιλοσοφία, so it might be a typο: φ and γ are next to each other on Greek keyboards.
