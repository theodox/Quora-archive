I’ve been waiting for this one for… forever. Through a long chain of circumstances too tedious to recount, I once got the chance to present an achievement to Team ICO at CEDEC, the Japanese GDC. As a giggly _ICO_  fanboy I totally embarrassed myself. But if this game does half as much for the PS4 as _ICO_ and _Shadow of the Colossus_ did for the PS2 I’ll be buy a Playstation just for this one.

I’ve always felt that the original _Titanfall_ didn’t get the following it deserved; it did a bunch interesting things in the shooter at a time when the genre was stale even by shooter standards. Some of the new gameplay in TF 2 looks like a blast and it seems like they’ve doubled down on the interesting assymmetries in the original design.

_Battlefield 1,_ because the Great War just doesn’t get enough respect — it’s almost as graphically compelling as it is tragic. Plus, I’m hoping this pushes the series back towards its slightly goofy action-adventure roots. BF never really held my attention once it tried to go _Call of Duty;_ I loved it best in the crazy, anarchic and much less realistically constrained days of [Battlefield 1942.](https://www.battlefield.com/games/battlefield-1942)

Plus this sort of makes up for the whole “Xbox One” naming thing. Sorta.

I’m really hoping that No Man’s Sky is good. I’m fascinated with procedural world tech, and I keep waiting for examples of it that feel like something more than just random number generation gone wild. I haven’t been blown away by what I’ve seen so far but I remain hopeful.

I’m not sure what’s up with _Gigantic’s_  release date, but all my hands on time with it has been fun and the folks who make it are super talented.
