Let me just jump in before [Tim O'Neill](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-ONeill-1) gets here and point out that the flat-earth story is a modern, not an ancient myth: it was popularized between the 18th and 20th centuries as part of a general effort to make the Middle Ages seem backwards and barbaric. The sphericity of the earth was a completely non-controversial piece of ordinary factual knowledge from at least 5th century BC. See [What people fueled the flat earth theory in the middle ages after Ancient Greek astronomers had convincingly shown that the earth is round?](https://www.quora.com/What-people-fueled-the-flat-earth-theory-in-the-middle-ages-after-Ancient-Greek-astronomers-had-convincingly-shown-that-the-earth-is-round) for the details, which are well set out there.

That said, it's often very difficult for a modern reader to known when an ancient text is serious and what aspects of it were taken literally. The Greek writer Herodotus is sometimes known as the "Father of History" for his travelogue-cum-historical writings -- but even in antiquity we was also derided as the "[Father of Lies](http://classicalwisdom.com/herodotus-father-of-history/)" for retailing stories that struck his hearers as absurd. When he talks about tiny men battling giant storks in the Sudan, or giant ants collecting gold in the deserts of Egypt the audience -- ancient and modern may roll their eyes -- without perhaps realizing that the Pygmies of the Sudan are attested in Egyptian art and modern archaeology and that "giant stork" is a good a description of an ostrich as "river horse" is of "Hippotamus." (Nobody's got a good explanation for the ants, however)

 So the model posited in the question -- that 'mysticism' came in to substitute for a lack of 'facts' -- is misleading In a world without printing and photography, the line between "Fact" and "Fiction" was necessarily blurrier and people scaled their expectations accordingly, much like any sensible modern person does when sifting through accounts of miracle diets. Tales were told, no question. That they were _believed_  is much less obvious (go read _Don Quixote_  and see how most of the characters react to the Don's insistence on treating everything he read in his 'books of chivalry' as fact). They could be simply forms of entertainment, or idle speculation, or allegorical musings on the truths of life, or misremembered quotations from schoolbooks -- in short, the same kind of factitious stuff that clogs the internet, and for the same reasons.
