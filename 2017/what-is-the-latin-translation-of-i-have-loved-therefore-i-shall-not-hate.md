Amavi , ergo non odero

“I have loved, so I will not hate”

Amavi, odere ergo nolo

“I have loved, so I do not intend to hate”

There's not an exact Latin equivalent for the English distinction between “shall” and “will”; _nolo_ stresses__ choosing not to hate and _non odero_ emphasizes that it won't happen
