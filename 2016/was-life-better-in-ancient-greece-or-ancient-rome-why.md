That's a pretty tough question to answer in all sorts of ways - it's rarely true that life is "better" in one place than another. For Greece and Rome, though, the hard dividing line is probably ___gender___ _:_ you could argue all day about whether it was better to be Cicero or Socrates* but it would be hard not to notice that Roman women generally had a much freer life than their Greek counterparts. 

 With the notable exception of Sparta, most Greek cities kept women in harem-like seclusion, with very little chance to venture out on their own and few opportunities for education and participation in public life. Although Roman women were still expected to be mothers first and foremost, they were also able to own property, to divorce their husbands, and they had powerful if indirect influence on society and politics. Pretty much the only women who occupied a public position in Greece were prostitutes.**

_** The position of women in Greece did improve over time; in the Hellenistic period when Rome was gradually dominating the Greek world you do find women less completely captive than they were in classical Athens.
