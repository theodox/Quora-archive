Well, the faithful would tell you that the oracle was always right — you just didn’t understand what you were told.

When Croesus of Lydia asked the oracle at Delphi if he should attack the Persians, the oracle replied that if he did, “he would destroy a mighty empire.”

He attacked — and was utterly defeated and enslaved. Here’s how that played out :

> …he sent Lydians to [Delphi](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/entityvote?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=1:chapter=90&auth=perseus,Delphi&n=1&type=place), telling them to lay his chains on the doorstep of the temple, and to ask the god if he were not ashamed to have persuaded Croesus to attack the Persians, telling him that he would destroy Cyrus' power; of which power (they were to say, showing the chains) these were the first-fruits. They should ask this; and further, if it were the way of the Greek gods to be ungrateful.

> When the Lydians came, and spoke as they had been instructed, the priestess (it is said) made the following reply. “No one may escape his lot, not even a god. Croesus has paid for the sin of his ancestor of the fifth generation before, who was led by the guile of a woman to kill his master, though he was one of the guard of the Heraclidae, and who took to himself the royal state of that master, to which he had no right. And it was the wish of [Apollo] that the evil lot of [Sardis](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/entityvote?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=1:chapter=91&auth=perseus,Sardis&n=1&type=place) fall in the lifetime of Croesus' sons, not in his own; but he could not deflect the Fates. Yet as far as they gave in, he did accomplish his wish and favor Croesus: for he delayed the taking of [Sardis](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/entityvote?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=1:chapter=91&auth=perseus,Sardis&n=2&type=place) for three years. And let Croesus know this: that although he is now taken, it is by so many years later than the destined hour… But as to the oracle that was given to him, Croesus is wrong to complain concerning it. For [Apollo] declared to him that if he led an army against the Persians, he would destroy a great empire. Therefore he ought, if he had wanted to plan well, to have sent and asked whether the god spoke of Croesus' or of Cyrus' empire. But he did not understood what was spoken, or make further inquiry: for which now let him blame himself.
