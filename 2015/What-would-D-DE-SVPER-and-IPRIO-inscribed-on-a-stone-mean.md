Desuper (one word) can be "from above" ([Latin Word Study Tool](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=desuper&la=latin#lexicon)) D could be _Dis,_  "To the spirits" (seen often on tombstones as DM, "dis manibus", to the _manes_  or spirits of the departed). Possible the D is _dedicatus._ 

IPRIO might be truncated: the formation looks like a dative, but it's hard to guess what the word might be. There's an Oscan(?) dialect word 'Ciprius' meaning 'good' which might become Ciprio, but if it's Oscan it's way, way before Charlemagne. There might be vulgar latin words with an -IPRIUS ending (going by sound alone, it's not 'proper' AFAIK). At a very outside guess, if that O was misread for A (not impossible if the letters were in uncial form) and there was a missing C, it could be "CIPRIA" or "for Cypris", ie, Aphrodite.

Alternatively, it could be I(m)P(e)RIO, to/for the _power_ or possibly _empire_ although in this context that does not seem idiomatic. Dropping nasals like M is a common late-latin abbreviation in manuscripts; so is contracting _per_ , but usually that's done with a squiggle.

Lastly, of course, it could be an abbreviation like SPQR, in which case we're just in your-guess-is-as-good-as-mine territory.

__update__ : IPRIO shows up in this inscription from the Balkans: [PHI Greek Inscriptions](http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/main?url=oi%3Fikey%3D297862%26bookid%3D734%26region%3D5%26subregion%3D14). However it's without context and presumably truncated. Dacia was heavily militarized during the period of the inscription so it could be a military term, but of course religious dedications are so common in antiquity that's always a safe guess too.
