We don’t have attendance statistics, of course, but if you go by literary mentions and archaeological evidences the big ones were:

__[Delphi](https://www.ancient.eu/delphi/)__ the most prestigious of the pan-Hellenic oracles, it was attracting offerings even from non-Greeks as early as the 7th century BC.. Here a priestess would sit in a cave, inhaling volcanic vapors, and make her pronouncements in the name of Apollo.

__[Dodona](https://www.ancient.eu/Dodona/)__ ____ in Epirus seems to have roots that go all the way back to Mycenaean times. This was an oracle sacred to Zeus, rather than Apollo; the voice of the god was discerned in the rustling leaves of the sacred oak tree. Dodona’s priestess (the “doves” who nested in the sacred tree) were more often consulted on private rather than political matters.

The __[Necromanteion of Acheron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necromanteion_of_Acheron)__ ____ — perhaps [this archaeological site in Epirus](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/necromanteion-of-ephyra), though we’re not certain — was a place to ask questions of the dead. Legendarily this was where Odysseus talked to the spirits of dead in book 11 of Odyssey. There was another necromanteion at __[Cumae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumaean_Sibyl)__ __,__ just north of modern Naples — that’s where Aeneas saw the spirits of _his_  dead in the Aeneid, book 6 — the otherworldliness of that spot probably stemmed from the deadly airs of __[Lake Avernus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avernus)__ __,__ whose volcanic fumes killed passing birds.

The temple of Aesclepius at __[Epidaurus](https://www.ancient.eu/epidaurus/)__ ____ was a a popular medical oracle. Here the god spoke through dreams: those in search of healing would sleep on the site, and then relate their dreams to the priests who would interpret them in the form of medical advice.

The oracle at __[Antissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antissa)__ , on the island of Lesbos, was reputedly where the head of Orpheus was interred and uttered prophecies. A Greek tradition held that Cyrus the Great consulted this oracle.

The __[Oracle of Ammon at Siwa](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/ammon-siwa/)__ __,__ where Alexander the Great proclaimed his own divinity, was not originally a Greek oracle but it was a very popular oracle in the Greek world as early as the sixth century BC. The Egyptian Ammon (or Amun) was analogized to Zeus; [one of the reasons Alexander chose this spot for his announcement](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=a89a8f4c&srid=zLvM) was that he was declaring his descent from Zeus. But long before Alexander this was a pilgrimage spot for Greeks like the poet Pindar and the Athenian statesman Cimon.

Another overseas oracle was at __[Didyma](https://www.ancient.eu/article/640/the-temple-of-apollo-at-didyma/)__ in Asia Minor, near Miletus. Like Delphi, this oracle belonged to Apollo, but here the god spoke through a sacred spring rather than volcanic vapors. Didyma seems to have gone out of fashion for a time between the Persian wars and the conquests of Alexander, but was popular again until the fifth century.

There were also a countless host of local oracles which rose and fell in popularity. They were often connected to obscure figures who didn’t fit into the Olympian pantheon, like __[Trophonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophonius)__ in central Greece or __[Amphiareius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiareion_of_Oropos)__ ____ in Attica. Others were connected to familiar gods and goddesses in some very obscure capacity. The Greek market in oracles was very competitive — there are many local myths and legends which explain how one oracle rose to prominence or another fell. Only a handful managed to retain their cultural prominence for many generations.
