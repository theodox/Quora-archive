The word actually originated in sailing ships: in the 18th century it referred to small additional sails rigged at the highest available positions on a tall ship, intended to provide additional thrust. By the early 19th century it had become slang for lots of other high things â€” top hats, tall horses, or very large people. It got its modern meaning around the end of the 19th century.
