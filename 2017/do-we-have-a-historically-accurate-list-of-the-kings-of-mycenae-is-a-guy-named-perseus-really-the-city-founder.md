# Do we have a historically accurate list of the Kings of Mycenae? Is a guy named Perseus really the city-founder?

We don’t have anything from Mycenae directly which is a “king list” or similar. Most of what survives from that period is the ancient equivalent of tax records or shopping records.

However, there’s pretty good reason for believing that the names which made it down to historic times have _some_ basis in historic fact. Among the personal names which show up in Linear B sources are such famous ones as A-ki-re-o (Achilles), E-ko-to (Hector) and O-re-ta (Orestes) and a-re-ka-sa-da-ra (Alexandra, the female form of Alexandros). That’s not to say we’ve got direct records of the legendary figures, since (for example) that “A-ki-re-o” was a shepherd, not a warrior king — but it’s a good example of how surprisingly resilient some of those traditions were, despite a 400 years “Greek Dark Age” between the end of Mycenae and the revival of literacy in Greece.
