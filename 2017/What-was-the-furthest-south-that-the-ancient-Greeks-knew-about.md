It’s not known exactly, but it’s somewhere close to Dar-Es-Salaam, Tanzania.

In the classical period the Persian occupation of Egypt and Mesopotamia meant that access to the south was limited. By the 5th century BC Greeks knew [the story - preserved in Herodotus](https://www.quora.com/Did-Necho-commission-a-Phoenician-circumnavigation-of-Africa-around-600BC) - that a Phoenician crew had circumnavigated Africa from the Red Sea around to Carthage in Tunisia — however at that point they had no direct experience and they didn’t believe the tale (Herodotus scoffed at the notion that a ship sailing westward could have the sun on its right hand side, which is of course exactly what makes it a compelling story).

Later, after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt, and particularly after[ the opening of sea trade with India, Sri Lanka, and East Africa in the second century ](https://www.quora.com/I-have-heard-that-ancient-Greece-and-Rome-were-having-trades-with-south-Indian-kingdoms-But-in-history-why-werent-these-given-much-importance-and-not-talked-about)BC, the Greeks acquired a pretty good knowledge of the Indian Ocean. There were regular sailings as far as Sri Lanka and the Horn of Africa.

The [Periplus of the Erythraean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periplus_of_the_Erythraean_Sea), a trade manual from the first century AD, says the farthest southern market of “[Azania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azania)” — ie, East Africa — is [Rhapta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhapta); but Rhapta has never been conclusively identified. It’s believed to be somewhere on the northern coast of Tanzania around 8 degrees south of the Equator. There’s no record of anyone going farther than that, and some sources claimed that south of Rhapta the coast of Africa curved around to the east and joined up with Asia — a good indication that nobody every made it much further.
