He only really conquered one country, or rather, one empire: the Persian Empire. But since the Persian Empire was the biggest empire in the world at the time, it certainly looked like he conquered the world — particularly since his conquests took only a decade (an average about half a million square kilometers per year!). There were about 50 major ethnic groups and hundreds of minor ones within this territory.

Starting in Greece, Alexander got as far as what is today India, just over the what today is the border with Pakistan.

Here’s a map of his empire at its height with Latin names for the major areas. They would be slightly different in English — for example, “Aegyptus” is just Egypt — but for the most part our versions are just slight tweaks to the names as known in Greek and the Latin names are transliterations of the Greek anyway.

So no — he didn’t conquer the world, but his record stood for quite a while: the Roman empire covered a wider swathe from east to west and north to south, but it included the Mediterranean, so it was slightly smaller in actual _land_ area.
