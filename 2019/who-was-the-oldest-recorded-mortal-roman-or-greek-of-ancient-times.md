The oldest recorded Greek individuals are names which show up in Linear B tablets from the Mycenaean era, starting around the 14th century BC. There’s not a solid agreement about the relative dating of the many records so it’s tough to be sure. However one of the strongest candidates is the Iklaina Tablet, found in the western Peloponnese, which may be as old as 1400 BC — if so, it’s the oldest piece of legible writing in Europe.

The right hand image here includes a man’s name, written as Ra-tu-ko (followed by a number 1, for accounting purposes.) This name doesn’t correspond to any later known Greek names, so it’s not easy to by sure if it’s actually a Greek name or not, though the ending makes it seem so.

For more recognizable names, there are a lot of proper names from the [Mycenaean records of Knossos, in Crete](https://www.world-archaeology.com/great-discoveries/linear-b-tablets/), which date closer to 1350 BC. Those archives include many personal names, such as A-pi-ja-ko-ro, (_Amphiagoras)_ , A-pi-me-de (_Amphimëdës_ ), E-ke-me-de (_Ekhemëdës)_ and E-u-da-mo (Eudamos)__ Women’s names there include recognizable ones like A-re-ka-sa-da-ra, (_Alexandra_ ), and Ka-sa-da-ra, (_Kassandra_ ).

Knossos tablets also include the names of familiar deities from the classical period, including Po-se-da-o (_Poseidon_ ), A-re (Ares) and E-ra (_Hera_ ).

__EDIT__ 

The question comment effectively hides the real meaning of the question! A good match for “oldest known Greek” would be [Hieronymus of Cardia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_of_Cardia), a companion of Alexander the Great who outlived his famous friend by about 80 years, dying at the age of 104 in the year 250 BC.
