No. The Roman never felt the least need for subtlety in their dealings with Judea. Their usual attitude towards the region was one of contemptuous disdain, and in general they made the only the barest concessions to Jewish sensibilities (though Julius Caesar was an interesting exception to the general rule). Even Tacitus— who was distinguished in his own day for conceding many virtues to the Germans and Britons, when other Romans affected to despise such ‘barbarians’ — had only [luridly nasty things to say](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/tacitus/tacitus-on-the-jews/) about Jews.

The Romans controlled Judea at swordpoint. To start with they did it on the cheap, using local proxies like the very unsavory [Herod](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/herod-the-great/), of Biblical fame. When Herod’s house fell apart in fratricide (and when the exasperated subjects pleaded for direct Roman rule!) they took over directly. However they never learned how to conciliate their subjects for very long. Between 66 and 132 they fought three major wars against Judea starting with the destruction of Jerusalem and ending with the [ethnic cleansing of Jewish Judea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt) and several hundreds of thousands dead. After 132 there were — at least officially — no more Jews in Judea to suppress.

In the mean time, of course, the Romans were also pursuing Christians, pretty much from the first moment they became aware of their existence.

Even the most dedicated conspiracy theorist would be hard put to come up with a story that made this all into a masterpiece of Roman maneuvering.
