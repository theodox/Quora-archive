The British have never been comfortable with a strong France and in Napoleon’s day they had plenty of reasons, both traditional and current, to be uneasy. The self-image of late-18th century Britain was deeply tied to the two epic struggles against Louis XIV (1687–97 and 1701–14) which were seen then much as most people see World War II today: as a hard-fought struggle to “save the world” from an aggressive conqueror.

It was, needless to say, quite easy to adapt that template to France under Napoleon.

When Napoleon came to power in 1799, Great Britain and France had already been at war for six years. Napoleon was already known as a talented and ambitious general who was willing to try unorthodox tactics (his great adventure in Egypt was an effort to cut British communications with India). Revolutionary France had already reawakened traditional fears in Britain. In 1797 the French had tried to organize an invasion of England, which was prevented by a British naval victory at [Cape St Vincent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_St_Vincent_(1797)) (only a sad little remnant of the effort reached British soil - the [Légion Noire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9gion_Noire), effectively a suicide mission of about a thousand former convicts, actually landed in Wales — the last foreign invaders to set foot on British soil). In 1798 the French had supported the rebellion of the [United Irishmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Rebellion_of_1798) against British rule in Ireland.

Above all, the French had invented the draft: by forced conscription they had raised an army of over 500.000 when few of their opponents could

Still, British were not always implacably against Napoleon. Some of them regarded him as a bulwark against the excesses of the early Revolution. Some tried to see him as a reformer and a modernizer (although this image faded fairly quickly as the extent of his police-state and the magnitude of his ambitions became clear). In any case the British did sign the [Treaty of Amiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Amiens) in 1801 which gave Europe it’s only peace between outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 and the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815. This was an effort at fitting the events of the period into the ordinary template of European diplomacy: treaties, land-swaps, and handshakes among gentlemen — not a full-throated war of ideologies.

However, it didn’t last very long.

Within two years Napoleon’s restlessness was obvious. He absorbed the nominally independents republics of Italy, Batavia (Holland) and Helvetia (Switzerland) as well as annexing the Piedmont and a chunk of western Germany. Napoleon also exerted great power over his neighbors — for example, forcing through constitutional changes in the Holy Roman Empire which weakened the power of this enemies (including the King George III of England who was also the Elector of Hannover). He also sold the French territories in North America to Thomas Jefferson — ensuring American support for his own war effort and filling his coffers with much-needed gold.

These aggressive maneuvers revived the traditional British fear of a strong France; and this time the British became convinced that Bonaparte, himself, was the issue. His ambitions and his talents were both outsized (here it’s not impossible that his mastery of propaganda worked to his disadvantage). He was Louis XIV all over again - only vastly more dangerous.

The Revolution had faded — by 1804, the French Republic was dead and Napoleon had accepted the Crown of Charlemagne from the Pope and re-established titles of nobility for his Marshals — but Napoleon’s disregard for traditional tactics on the battlefield and in diplomacy signaled that the struggle was not going to be a neat little war of the 18th century pattern. It was going to end with a complete reordering of European politics. Napoleon was going to be the new Charlemagne — or a hunted outlaw. Nothing between.

This map pretty graphically shows the real reason the British were fighting. From 1803 to 1810 the blue pieces - Napoleon, his puppets, and his defeated enemies - are the heart of Europe. Not only are they a military threat, they are also a closed trading bloc: the so-called “[Continental System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_System)”. Even if Britain could retain its independence against a continent united under Napoleon, it would be economically crippled. This economic conflict was so central to Napoleon’s strategy that he invaded both allied Spain and neutral Russia to force them to support his embargo In fact the invasion of Russia in 1812, which began his final defeat, stemmed from as an effort to force Russia into the blockade.

The events of the next several years made it clear that the struggle was going to be long and bitter. The British worked to rebuild the coalition against Napoleon, bringing the Austria, Russia and eventually Sweden. The French prepared an invasion force of 180,000 for a landing in Britain, but were put off by the British victory at [Trafalgar ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar)in 1805. This established the pattern for the next decade: neither side could land a death-blow, since the British were safe behind their fleet and Napoleon behind his enormous Grand Armee. Britain’s continental partners had their own reasons for hating Napoleon, who was absorbing their territories at an alarming rate — but none of them could stand up to Napoleon on the battlefield. Only British money kept them in the war.
