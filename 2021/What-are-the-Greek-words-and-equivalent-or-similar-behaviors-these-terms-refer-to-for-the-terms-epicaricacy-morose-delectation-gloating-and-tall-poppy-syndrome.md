Epicaricacy is already Greek: it’s __ἐπιχαιρεκακία__ “joy in bad things” — the word is formed by a similar same thought process as the more common _schadenfreude_ , “harm-pleasure”.

Greek had a pretty rich vocabulary for negative judgements of your neighbors; __ἐπιχαιρεκακία__ stood for pleasure in somebody else’s misfortune while __φθόνος__ _pthonos_ stood for pain at somebody’s else’s good fortune. __νέμεσις__ _nemesis_  was displeasure at another’s _undeserved_  good fortune.

> The righteously indignant man (_nemesetikos_ ) is pained by undeserved good fortune; the jealous man (_pthonoteros)_ exceeds him and is pained by all the good fortune of others; while the malicious (_epikhairekakos)_  man so far falls short of being pained that he actually feels pleasure.

[Nichomachean Ethics, 1108b](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0086,010:1108b#note1)

Aristotle tries to arrange it so that νέμεσις forms a midway-point between ἐπιχαιρεκακία and φθόνος but that’s actually somewhat forced, more tribute to his obsessive desire to connect virtue with the “mean” between extremes. Earlier he says this instead:

> Not every action or emotion however admits of the observance of a due mean. Indeed the very names of some directly imply evil, for instance ἐπιχαιρεκακία, shamelessness, φθόνος, and, of actions, adultery, theft, murder

[Nichomachean Ethics 1107a](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1107a)

On key sentiment which Aristotle seems to have begun, but which became a key discussion point later, is the fact that ἐπιχαιρεκακία is the literal inverse of pity: the ability to feel pleasure at another’s pain is mechanically similar to the ability to feel pain at another’s pain. For this reason the Stoics were particularly hard on ἐπιχαιρεκακία: it was both bad-in-itself, but also indicative of a weakness for emotional linkages of any kind, which they regarded as a dangerous chink in the philosopher’s armor. Here’s how Cicero summed it up:

> compassion and envy [_invidia]_  are consistent in the same man; for whoever is uneasy at any one’s adversity is also uneasy at another’s prosperity… as pity is an uneasiness which arises from the misfortunes of another, so envy is an uneasiness that proceeds from the good success of another: therefore whoever is capable of pity is capable of envy. But a wise man is incapable of envy, and consequently incapable of pity. But were a wise man used to grieve, to pity also would be familiar to him; therefore to grieve is a feeling which cannot affect a wise man.

[Tusculan Disputations, 10](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14988/14988-h/14988-h.htm)

Suspicion of strong emotional ties — positive or negative — was a persistent theme in Greek thinking: ἐπιχαιρεκακία was a vice, not only because feeling pleasure at another’s discomfiture is unkind but also because it was a surrender of emotional autonomy to outside circumstances.

However, in ordinary Greek discussions it’s φθόνος that is is the everyday word for irrational resentment directed at others — and it’s [a very, very central idea in Greek thinking.](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199562602.001.0001/acprof-9780199562602-chapter-7) The poet Pindar, whose livelihood came from celebrating the achievements of Olympic victors and war heroes, devoted a lot of verbiage to pre-empting what he expected to be the routine φθόνος directed at the successful:

> ἀστῶν δ᾽ ἀκοὰ κρύφιον θυμὸν βαρύνει μάλιστ᾽ ἐσλοῖσιν ἐπ᾽ ἀλλοτρίοις.
ἀλλ᾽ ὅμως, κρέσσων γὰρ οἰκτιρμοῦ φθόνος, 
μὴ παρίει καλά.

> what the citizens hear secretly weighs heavy on their spirits, especially concerning the merits of others. Yet, since envy is better than pity, do not abandon fine deeds!

[Pythian 1, 84ff](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0161%3Abook%3DP.%3Apoem%3D1)

φθόνος is usually translated as “envy,” or sometimes “jealousy.” which in English makes it feel like a minor vice. In Greek however it carries a lot more weight (and it’s not connected to romantic jealousy at all). Importantly, φθόνος is always negative*: Greek had a different word, ζῆλος _zelos,_ for the kind of envy which inspires competition, rather than unmixed resentment: in English this is _zeal,_ although nowadays we tend to use it as a synonym for “enthusiasm” its original meaning was closer to “rivalry.”** You’ll frequently see ζῆλος translated — correctly, but not always very usefully — as “emulousness”. “ill will” or “resentment” are really better translations than the conventional “envy.”

In a society which had a long history of violent factional strife, the resentments bound up φθόνος were seen as central to human nature; [as Herodotus says](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.%203.80&lang=original):

> φθόνος δὲ ἀρχῆθεν ἐμφύεται ἀνθρώπῳ
from birth envy is rooted in man

and [Hesiod](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D11)

> καὶ κεραμεὺς κεραμεῖ κοτέει καὶ τέκτονι τέκτων,
καὶ πτωχὸς πτωχῷ φθονέει καὶ ἀοιδὸς ἀοιδῷ.

> potter begrudges potter, and craftsman craftsman
beggar envies beggar, and minstrel, minstrel

Plutarch wrote an entire essay on how to live in an envy-ridden society, known as _[How To Make Use Of Your Enemies](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0158%3Asection%3D1)_ _._ You can get a sense of how deeply this ran through Greek thought when [he says](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0158%3Asection%3D10)

> ἐπεὶ δὲ πάσαις κορυδαλλίσι χρὴ λόφον ἐγγενέσθαι κατὰ τὸν Σιμωνίδην, καὶ πᾶσα φύσις ἀνθρώπου φέρει φιλονεικίαν καὶ ζηλοτυπίαν καὶ φθόνον, κενεοφρόνων ἀνδρῶν ἑταῖρον, ὥς φησι Πίνδαρος,

> Simonides always said there was no lark without its crest; just so the disposition of men is naturally pregnant with love-of-victory (φιλονεικία, _philonikeia)_ , jealousy (ζηλοτυπία, _zelotypia)_ , and

> “envy (φθόνος), the companion of empty-brained men”

> as Pindar says.

Perhaps the most perfectly characteristic example of φθόνος[ is the story of Aristides the Just and how he was ostracized (exiled) from Athens](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plut.%20Arist.%207&lang=original):

> it is said that an unlettered and utterly boorish fellow handed his ostrakon to Aristides, whom he took to be one of the ordinary crowd, and asked him to write Aristides on it. He, astonished, asked the man what possible wrong Aristides had done him. ‘None whatever,’ was the answer, ‘I don't even know the fellow, but I am tired of hearing him everywhere called 'The Just.'’ On hearing this, Aristides made no answer, but wrote his name on the ostrakon and handed it back.

In many ways, envy in all of its finely-subdivided forms is _the_  Greek passion. There’s a reason φθόνος is a must-have [in every list of vices in the Greek New Testament](https://biblehub.com/greek/5355.htm). In Pope Gregory’s original list of the seven deadly sins envy (_invidia)_ was number two, right after pride; Augustine called it _diabolicum vitium,_ “the devil’s own vice.”***

There’s a book-length discussion of the role of φθόνος, ζῆλος, and resentment in general in Peter Walcott’s _[Envy and the Greeks](http://www.theaugeanstables.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/walcot-greek-envy-ch-1-3.pdf)_ _,_ which is a bit burdened by Freudian jargon but contains a very thorough discussion of the central role of resentments in Greek thought. ἐπιχαιρεκακία is a relatively minor player in the great drama of Greek envy, but its mere existence as a technical term speaks volumes to the the way hyper-competitive, tightly packed Greek society dealt with social competition.



*There’s a case to be made that the distinction between malicious φθόνος and neutral ζῆλος comes a bit later than Hesiod — but for the most part this dichotomy is strong.

**Our “jealous” comes originally from the Latinized _zelosus,_ which got morphed into _gelos_  in Old French; it’s modern romantic meaning emerged as part of the Medieval literature of courtly love where most of the “zeal” on display was romantic.

***Latin didn’t retain the distinction between φθόνος and ἐπιχαιρεκακία — Aquinas, who didn’t know Greek, rendered the above bit of Aristotle with the nonsense word “epicacocharchia” although he grasped the general sentiment. The large Latin discourse on _invidia_  includes all forms of ill-will towards others.
