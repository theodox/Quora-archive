It’s important to make a distinction between the transmission of _ideas_  and the transmission of _texts._ 

By and large the original texts we use today derive from copies that survived in the Greek speaking world, which was intensely conservative when it came to the preservation of ancient Greek literature. We owe almost all of our knowledge of Greek literature to the work of Greek copyists who kept those works alive (or at least, preserved) in the libraries and monasteries of the Byzantine empire.

Arab interpreters of Greek works — particularly in medicine and mathematics, but also in philosophy — were extremely important for jump-starting interest in Greek ideas in western Europe. Greek-language knowledge of any kind was very scarce in Western Europe from about the 6th through the 14th centuries. It was Latin translations of Arabic (or Iberian Hebrew) commentaries on Greek works that renewed interest in Greek ideas during this period when the original texts were unavailable to most. Aristotle, in particular, became a subject of intense fascination for medieval theologians thanks to Arab commentators like [Averroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes): for many medieval writers Aristotle was simply “the philosopher” and Averroes “the commentator.” The influence of Arabic Aristotelianism was so powerful that it eventually contributed to a revival of interested in Aristotle in the Greek speaking world (where most medieval philosophers were much more attuned to the Neo-Platonic tradition).

However, Arabic-language interest in Greek was was limited primarily to a narrow range of topics and authors; above all, it was focused _information and ideas_ , not the preservation of the language itself. There were substantial Greek speaking communities in Islamic areas (in Sicily, in Egypt, and in Syria) but those communities declined over time — some members emigrated, others converted and adopted Arabic as their primary language — and so the reservoir of texts gradually dried up. When the great 9th century Arabic translator [Hunayn ibn Ishaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunayn_ibn_Ishaq) went in search of new manuscripts to render in Arabic, he traveled to Constantinople.

It’s also important to remember that literary and historical works that didn’t interest Arabic doctors, mathematicians or theologians: there almost no examples of Greek literary, historical or dramatic works that came to western Europe through Arabic channels. It’s telling that the oldest known complete Arabic translation of the _Iliad_  — the keystone of Greek literature — dates to the 19th century, though (as one of the commenters pointed out) there [are fragments and ambiguous references going all the way back to ibn Ishaq.](https://hakimbishara.com/post/143817639294/homer-the-arab)

By contrast, the Greek world retained intensely connected to its own classical heritage. Consider this medieval Byzantine introduction to an edition of the Iliad from 12th century:

> Homer is like the Sirens. Perhaps it would be best if you kept clear of him from the start — if you blocked your ears with wax, or steered another course to escape the magic. But suppose you made your way onward through the range of his song you would not easily pass him by, even if you were loaded with chains; and if you did, you would not be glad of it…. It is an old saying that out of Ocean arose all rivers, all springs, all wells. So out of Homer flooded down to the sages most if not all of the great stream of language. Of all the men one could mention who labored at astronomy, or science or ethics or profane literature generally, no one passed by Homer’s tent without a welcome.

Archbishop (and later St.) Eustathios of Thessalonica, [Commentary on the Iliad 1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20163213?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A5b614461f5185a732a5734c059c004da&seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents)

The intimacy of that connection — linguistic and cultural as well as intellectual — has no easy match in the Arabic tradition. The Arab polymaths knew about Greek thought — but of course the Byzantines _lived_  it. And so they continued to copy and study and imitate the originals. The Greek classics formed the core of Byzantine education right down to the end of the empire in 1453.

Thus the Arabic commentaries stimulated the _demand_ for Greek texts by reviving interest in Greek medical, mathematical and philosophical ideas — but it was the Byzantines, for the most part, who actually preserved the original works which we study today. If you pick an ancient Greek text at random and follow the trail of manuscripts back you will almost always find the trail begins in a Byzantine scriptorium. Only a few works — for example, the [Mechanica ](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mechanica)of Heron of Alexandria — reach us only in Arabic translation. The search for the original texts was stimulated by the Arabic to Latin translations which circulated in the Middle Ages, but for the most part the Greek works we read today stem from the Byzantine manuscripts which gradually replaced those translations between the 14th and the 17th centuries.
