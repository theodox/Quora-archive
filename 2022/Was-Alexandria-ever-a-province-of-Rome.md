Not independently- the province was Egypt, with Alexandria forming a particularly privileged part.

Alexandria was the seat of the Roman governors of Egypt from the time of Augustus onwards, and it’s status was reflected in the official provincial designation of the governor as _praefectus Alexandreae et Aegypti, “_ prefect of Alexandria and Egypt/”

In the later imperial period, Egypt was divided into three smaller units: Aegyptus (run from Alexandria), Thebais in the south (run from Thebes). For a while in the fourth century this truncated Aegyptus was sudivided betweem _Aegyptus Iovia_ in the western Delta, including Alexandria, and _Aegyptus Herculia_ covering the eastern delta and the central stretch of the Nile. Later Herculia was split again, with the up-river portion becoming _Augustamnica._ This was part of a general trend towards smaller units as the Empire instituted more a centralized bureaucracy.

Throughout this, Alexandria retained its unique importance as the capital of the [Diocese of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Egypt), a collection of provinces which included all of Egypt and Cyrenaica.
