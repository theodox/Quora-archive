The modern Greek word __πλοίο__ , “ship” or “vessel” comes ultimately from the ancient Greek __πλοῖον,__ which means the same thing.

The Greek one is very similar to the old Indo-European root word for floating or swimming, which is reconstructed as [*pleu-. ](https://www.etymonline.com/word/float)In northern European languages the root tended to turn the “p” sound to “f”, hence _float_  in English. Other Indo-European languages to the east it kept the “p” for words related to floating, swimming and sailing, so you get words like __плувам__ in Bulgarian, __plȕti__ in Croatian and __plout__ in Czech.

Since the same root is common to many Slavic-derived languages it’s easy to see why it might sound like a Slavic derived word in modern Greek. However __πλοῖον__ and the verb __πλέω__ meaning “to sail” are both common in old Classical Greek texts. The root word ___*pleu-___ is very old in the Indo-European language family — it shows up in Sanskrit as[ Plu (प्लु)](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/plu)
