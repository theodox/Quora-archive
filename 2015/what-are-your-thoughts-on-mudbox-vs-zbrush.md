Most people find Mudbox easier to pick up and Zbrush to have a more unusual workflow and users experience. Mudbox uses familiar gestures, hotkeys, and generally borrows the conventions of traditional 3-d software like Max and Maya. ZBrush's interface is.... idiosyncratic. It tends to have very off-beat takes on how to interact with the user.

That said, I've personally found that Mudbox 'tops out' much faster: you can master mudbox in a couple of months, but after that you'll probably start coasting. Zbrush is harder to learn and takes longer to become familiar -- but it seems that it can be significantly more productive in the hands of a committed user. The fact that Zbrush manages to be the leading sculpting package despite it's oddball interface is testimony to how deep it is. To a large degree the willingness to ditch the CAD-based conventions of Max/Maya etc is why it is so good at what it does. 

In very compressed form: Mudbox = Notepad, ZBrush = vim or emacs.
