You are thinking of [Liutprand of Cremona, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liutprand_of_Cremona)who definitely deserves a spot on the “worst ambassadors of all times” list.

It wasn’t exactly his fault, it was a separate embassy from the Pope who caused offence by referring to emperor [Nikephoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikephoros_II_Phokas) as “emperor of the Greeks,” — but Liutprand was kind of a jerk, and this wasn’t exactly a period of normal friendly relations. The Byzantines had referred to Liutprand’s master (and the Pope’s ally) [Otto I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) as “king” rather than “emperor,” so the name-calling was trying to even the score. Otto had also fought a war with the Byzantines in the northern Adriatic not long before, so relations were pretty frosty

Most of the time , though, Liutprand delivered his insults in the proper form, recognizing the fact that the Byzantines were the direct heirs of the Romans, having retained the legal and political forms of the eastern half of the Empire in an unbroken line. He delivered [this diatribe](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/liudprand-embassy-excerpts.asp) to Byzantine emperor :

> "History tells us that Romulus, from whom the Romans get their name, was a fratricide born in adultery. He made a place of refuge for himself and received into it insolvent debtors, runaway slaves, murderers and men who deserved death for their crimes. This was the sort of crowd whom he enrolled as citizens and gave them the name of Romans. From this nobility are descended those men whom you style 'rulers of the world.' But we Lombards, Saxons, Franks, Lotharingians, Bavarians, Swabians and Burgundians, so despise these fellows that when we are angry with an enemy we can find nothing more insulting to say than -'You Roman!' For us in the word Roman is comprehended every form of lowness, timidity, avarice, luxury, falsehood and vice.

Unflattering — but clearly even Liutprand saw the Byzantines as Romans. Amazingly, he lived to tell the tale of this bit of diplomacy (though this is his version, perhaps a bit embellished once he was safely out of Byzantine territory).

Throughout this period there was an ongoing dispute between east and west over the legality of the western emperor’s title. In fact Liutprand’s mission was part of an effort to gain more legitimacy for the Liudolfing emperors by arranging a dynastic marriage between Otto’s son [Otto II ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor)and the a Byzantine princess. But there was also a long history of marriages between emperors and “barbarian” royalty, so this wasn’t especially novel except for the effort on the westerners’ part to portray it as an equal marriage.

It took many years of negotiaions (thanks in part to Liutprand’s “diplomacy”) and in the end the westerners had to settle for the [imperial niece Theophanu.](https://theodox.quora.com/The-beauty-of-contract-law) In a sign of the times. she was the niece of the [emperor who assassinated Nicephorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_I_Tzimiskes), not the Princess the westerners had originally bargained for.
