Well, without _legal_  consequences… yes. There was no formal check on the power that an emperor. Nero, for example, had his own mother murdered and also killed his own pregnant wife with a kick to the belly.

Of course “consequences” also includes the extra-legal outcomes that arise when people start to think you're a lunatic - such as, in Nero’s case, multiple plots against his life and an eventual military uprising which led him to commit suicide.
