I can't find my copy but [ Douglas Porch's ](http://amzn.to/1YkHRdu)_[French Foreign Legion](http://amzn.to/1YkHRdu)_  is probably a good place to look.

The Foreign Legion's English language [recruitment site](http://en.legion-recrute.com/mdl/info_seul.php?id=31&idA=84&block=25&titre=application-procedure) distinguishes the 'first 6 months' (of training) from reassignment. I'd assume that -- like most militaries -- it's possible to wash out of 'basic'. But you can probably get the authoritative word from there.
