EVE is not a particularly tough game on the content side, compared to many MMOs; it's an unusual game with more procedural content than games with a more human-scale focus and environment. I've seen estimates as high as $100 million for A_ge of Conan, APB_ , and _Guild Wars 2_ ; while Destiny has been pegged between $250 and $500 million. 

Those numbers are not necessarily apples-to-apples (the 2x difference in Destiny numbers, for example, may reflect the inclusion of the massive marketing effort as well as programmer and artist time). However the general ballpark for a modern AAA single player game is in the $40-50 million range, and MMOs are usually very content heavy so their costs are higher. 

Of course "as good as" is very subjective: plenty of great games can be made for peanuts and there have been plenty of expensive flops. $70 million is a lot of money, and if spent can have good production values and tight code although the world will contain less content than, say, World of Warcraft or GTA V. Spent poorly... well... that's another story. _Tabula Rasa,_  for example, was $75 million -ish without earning a lot of love.
