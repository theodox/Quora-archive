# Why was North Africa considered the breadbasket of the Roman Empire, considering how infertile it is? Was it just because of Egypt?

North Africa — most particularly the lowlands of modern Algeria, Tunisia and a bit of north-western Libya — was a very prosperous agricultural region in antiquity.

After they lost a lot of their overseas empire in the [First Punic War](http://www.ancient.eu/First_Punic_War/) (264–241 BC) the [Carthaginians](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Carthaginian_Empire) invested a lot of energy in their North African territories, using intensive agriculture and irrigation. Their neighbors in Numidia (mostly modern Algeria) picked up on these practices as well, which made the region very productive.

The Romans destroyed the city of Carthage in 146 BC but they were well aware of the value of North African agriculture - they planted colonies all over the area, creating new Roman towns alongside existing settlements and building bustling new towns like [Timgad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timgad) and [Theveste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theveste). The most famous Roman agricultural writer ([Columella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columella)) drew very heavily on a now-lost Carthaginian work by [Mago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mago_(agricultural_writer)). They extended and improved the Carthaginian farming and irrigation projects and turned North Africa into the breadbasket of the western mediterranean. A late Roman geographer described it thus:

> This region of Africa is altogether good, wealthy and fruitful, but the men living there are entirely unworthy to have it as their country, for they are said to be cunning — saying one thing and doing another — and among them are to be found many wicked and only a few decent people.*

The huge appetite of the city of Rome — which had a million inhabitants in the first, second and third centuries — ensured a ready market for wheat, produce, olives and olive oil from the area. About 2/3 of the _[Annona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura_Annonae)_ , the grain supply of the city itself, eventually came from North Africa (the remainder came mostly from Egypt); this may have been as much as 10 million bushels of wheat a year.

The region in antiquity was better watered than it is today; since then creeping desertification has been brought on by a combination of climate change, the exhaustion of fossil water supplies, and over-grazing (particularly after the Arab conquest brought lots of new pastoralists into the area). The [Vandal conquest of Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandal_Kingdom) in the 430’s disrupted the annona system, helping to accelerate the depopulation of the city of Rome and thus also to degrade the North African economy by shrinking its export market. The area stagnated after the Byzantine reconquest, and when it was conquered by the Arabs settled agriculture tended to take a back seat to pastoralism so the infrastructure supporting intensive farming declined.

Even today, though, the core of the old Roman agricultural regions is not a stereotypical desert. Modern Tunisia is a big exporter of cereals and olive oil.

_That quote is from the_ _[Totius Orbis Descriptio.](https://archive.org/stream/geographigraeci02mlgoog#page/n603/mode/1up)_ _The negativity toward the locals reflects both the ancient Roman stereotype against Carthaginians with the well-developed reputation of Roman-period North Africa for shrewdness, sharp dealing and sarcastic humor._
