There are a bunch of things which separate the pros from the hobbyists — and I’d start by pointing out the _talent_  isn’t one of them: there are a lot of amazingly talented hobbyists out there.

The main things you need _besides_ talent to get a job are:

__Relevant software experience__ . Paying jobs are pretty heavily concentrated among users of ‘pro’ software: 3ds Max and Maya account for something more than 3/4s of them, with Cinema4D, Houdini, and and handful of specialists programs making up most of the rest.* Pose, Daz, and similar software doesn’t get much play in the pro market — few studios or companies will be looking for that expertise.

__Relevant project experience.__  Most 3d jobs involve constraints and deadlines. It’s not fair to say it’s “easy” to make a nice looking scene if you have unlimited time and you don’t care about render times — but to a pro the difference between a scene that sells a mood or a message efficiently and renders in 5 minutes a frame and one that looks a little better but renders in 5 hours is very significant. A lot of what people will be looking for is experience in finding ways to create images that are efficient as well as beautiful. Completed projects (films, commercials, games etc) count for more than individual images. It also helps to be able to talk intelligently about why and how the scene was done with a particular approach : how it matched either the art direction or the time constraints or the technical limitations of the project.

__Job direction__ . Although film, games and VFX share a lot of tools they are very different businesses and they look for very different skills and attitudes. When looking for any job, 3D or otherwise, the company doing the hiring will see you as the answer to a particular problem (“We need somebody who’s good at doing offline physics simulations” or “we need somebody to do spell effects for our game”) and not as a fully rounded human being. So it’s really important to read up on particular job types and the way the market for them goes up and down: a portfolio of beautiful raytraced stills might be a good eye-catching intro to a job in the subset of VFX and film that deals with rendering, but it’s not very relevant to a job doing real-time animation - whereas a really well done game walk-cycle or attack move may not seem very impressive for a performance-heavy character job in a film studio.

Above all, you need to remember that “3d” isn’t a job any more than “computers” is a job — you need to learn about particular businesses and the unique problems they are concerned with. The most effective way to get a job is always to understand what people are need and present yourself as a good fit for their problems.

_* the modeling market is more diverse: in architecture, Sketchup is a pro tool; Zbrush and 3d Coat are pro tools for sculpts; and there are a number of pure CAD programs in the engineering market._
