There were legal rules establishing different kinds of business entities. but they were all variations on partnerships or _societates_ . With a couple of exceptions (see below) Rome didn’t have permanent legal corporations.

It would be possible to buy “shares” in a _societas_  insofar as several persons might contribute different amounts of money to a joint venture. However the purchase was a personal one, not a commodity: a member of a partnership couldn’t transfer his share in the partnership to anyone else by sale or inheritance without the permission of the other partners. As a contract between individuals the _societas_  ended with the death or retirement of any of the partners.

Your share in the partnership could be something other than cash — for example, you might include the captain of a ship as a one partner, the owner of the ship as another, and a group of merchants providing cargo all as partners at some agreed-upon rate of ownership in the profits of the voyage.

However, all of these arrangements were basically contracts between individuals. In the economic sphere, at least, there was no Roman version of a limited liability corporation with its own “legal personhood” and with a distinction between corporate and private responsibility. There was a legal distinction between agreements made by the partnership and those made by the partners as individuals — one partner could not enter into a contract which bound the others, or add a new partner, without the approval of the existing partners — but ultimately the partnership was a contract between individuals and not the charter of an independent entity.

The only legally recognized entities which outlived their human members were _collegia_  and _sodalitates —_ guild associations and religious groups — which owned property collectively. There was also a sort of borderline case in the form of the _publicani_ , the tax-farmers. These associations would front the money for provincial tax revenue to the Roman government, and then collect the actual revenue from the provincials (taking a cut, of course). The amount of money involved was enormous, so the partnerships involved many individual people, so these kinds of partnerships did not automatically end with the death of one partner. Some modern students regard these as ‘permanent corporations’ for this reason, but a more minimalist interpretation is that they were just large-scale partnerships with a streamlined mechanism for dealing with the departure of one partner.
