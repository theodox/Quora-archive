There is indeed one — and I believe _only_ one — concrete example of Egytian-Etruscan contacts… the enigmatic __Zagreb Mummy__ :

The Zagreb mummy originated in Egypt, It was purchased in 1848 by Mihajlo Barić, a Croatian tourist visiting Egypt. He used to display it in his livingroom in Vienna, surely a power move among minor Austro-Hungarian civil servants. Eventually it ended up in a museum in Zagreb, the ancestor of today’s [Archaeological Museum](https://www.amz.hr/en/home/).

In 1877, the Egyptologist [Heinrich Brugsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Karl_Brugsch) realized that the mummy wrappings, which were covered in densely packed writing, were not a routine Egyptian funeral text — in fact, the letters looked like the western variant of the Greek alphabet, the one that eventually begat Latin writing. Word of this got around to a variety of scholars, and in 1891 the mummy wrappings were sent to the Academy of Sciences in Vienna for investigation. There the Austrian Egyptologist Jacob Krall proved that the language was — contrary to all expexctations — __Etruscan.__

The mummy wrapping is usually known today as the _Liber Linteus Zagrebiensis_ , or “Linen book of Zagreb,” thanks to the slightly fusty habits of the Viennese Academy. It’s the longest and probably the most important Etruscan text. Alas, that’s not saying much: it’s only around twelve hundred words, and much of it is consumed with repetitive religious formulas. Our knowledge of Etruscan is sadly incomplete, and will probably remain so unless we find more texts to work with. 19th century accounts suggests that the mummy wrappings once included considerably more text, presumably lost to souvenir hunters or misadventures before professional curators took over custody — a source of much wailing and gnashing of teeth among Etruscanists.

Despite difficulties of vocabulary and grammar, we can read the text well enough to establish it’s origins somewhere between modern day Arrezo and Perugia, based on references to local Etruscan deities from that part of Tuscany.

That we can be pretty certain of — but finding out _when_  is a bit tricky. The usual scholarly guess, based on the style of the lettering, at a date is the middle of the third century BC — around the time of the first Punic war. However C14 dating suggests that the linen material might be as much as 150 years older than the text. And — to add to the mystery — the ritual year in the text appears to start in January, which (in Rome, anyway) was not generally regarded as the start of the year until about the middle of the _second_  century BC. The mummy who was wrapped in the bandages seems to be a bit later.

As for why this piece of obscure Etruscan lore ended up in Egypt, well, we don’t have much more than guesswork. As the confusing timeline suggests… whatever the story that created this artifact, it’s _complicated_ .

In Egypt this would have been towards the end of the long reign of [Ptolemy II ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_II_Philadelphus)— very much the Golden Age of Ptolemaic Egypt, when Alexandria’s reputation as a cultural and financial center was at its zenith. A community of Etruscan merchants residing in Egypt would seem to be a reasonable guess — except that the mummy appears to be that of an Egyptian woman named [Nesi-Hensu](https://www.peter-sheppard-skaerved.com/2009/12/nesi-hensu/), and she seems to have come from Thebes in central Egypt, not from the commercial center of Alexandria. The text on the mummy wrap is religious in nature but it’s Etruscan — not a part of the typical Egyptian repertoire of funeral spells and texts — is this an Egyptian woman who somehow got involved in the _disciplina Etrusca,_ the obscure Etruscan mystical tradition that fascinated the Romans and provided a lot of the flavor of Roman magic? Or is this just somebody whose family got a deal on some nice, unusual old linen? Is this part of the same kind syncretic impulse that led to the spread of Egyptian Isis temples throughout Roman Italy? Or maybe a byproduct of Egyptian efforts to buddy up with Etruscan cities at a time when Rome was preoccupied fighting in Carthage? And after all, It’s a religious calendar… maybe the Etruscans were in Egypt to get some advice on their calendar — which was probably pretty messy if it shared DNA with the Roman one… Its unreasonable to assume we will ever know exactly what chain of events led to the _Liber Linteus_ ending up wrapped around a middle-class Egyptian mummy from Thebes, though it can be fun to speculate.

Nonetheless, one thing we can do with confidence is to answer the original question. __Was there any connection between the Etruscans and the Egyptian?__  _Yes._ We don’t know _why,_ but the Zagreb mummy does tell us that the Etruscans and the Egyptians did indeed share at least one contact, unmediated by Greeks or Romans.
