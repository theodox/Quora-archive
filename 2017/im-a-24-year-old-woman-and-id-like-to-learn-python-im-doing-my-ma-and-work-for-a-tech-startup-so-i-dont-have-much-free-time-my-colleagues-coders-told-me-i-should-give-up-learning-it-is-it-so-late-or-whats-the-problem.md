# I’m a 24-year-old woman and I’d like to learn Python. I’m doing my MA and work for a tech startup, so I don’t have much free time. My colleagues/coders told me I should give up learning it. Is it so late or what’s the problem?

It’s definitely not too late!

Python is a friendly language — as far as a real-world programming language can be friendly, anyway — and it’s possible to be productive in very short order. I picked the language up in my late 30s; I’ve got a friend who has become proficient in under a year and he’s in his 50’s with a very busy full time job.

Don’t mistake programmer language snobbery for advice. Lots of techies have favorite tech or languages, and will discourage you from learning things they don’t think are “cool” or “the future.” Don’t get sucked into programmer politics: you have to start somewhere. If you’re eventually going to do something “cooler” you need to have something to start with and Python is a great starting place. If you’re just learning to get a better sense of how coding works and how programmers think, Python’s a fairly painless way to start.
