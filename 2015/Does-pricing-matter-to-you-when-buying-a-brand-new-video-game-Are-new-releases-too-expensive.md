__Does pricing matter?__ 

Well sorta, in the negative sense that I definitely feel the pressure to wait six months to see the price on Steam drop by half. As a developer I don't buy used games, since the people who made them get bupkis from resales.

__Are new releases too expensive?__ 

Halo (2001) cost under $15 million to make and sold for $50 ($67 in 2015).

Destiny (2014) cost upwards of $250 million to make and sold for $60.

So, __no.__
