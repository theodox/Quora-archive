# What happens to gamers as they age? Do their gaming habits change? Does arthritis or a slower reaction time start to set in?

I don't know about everybody else, but I can tell you what happened to me: 

Kids.

I'm lucky if I can devote an hour a week to games --- once or twice a year I'll binge on something and maybe get in 15 hours in a month, but that's a rare exception to the ordinary rule. There's homework to check, dinner to cook, rooms to clean and fights to break up... By the time I could conceivably sit down and actually tackle something, I'm pretty exhausted and not in the mood for too much challenge. Strategy games -- or anything that's episodic and doesn't suffer from being consumed in bite-size pieces -- are still a lot of fun. I love to play Smash Bros with young'uns and the occasional round of Destiny with the teen -- but I basically don't get to complete any long narrative driven games (on my time budget, they'd take a year to finish) and I can't put in enough time to be more than adequate at anything with heavy reflexes. 

On the other hand I will _never_  bow to the tyranny of Words With Friends.
