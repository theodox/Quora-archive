It's very hard to know for sure for a couple of reasons.

First, our word lists are basically post-Sumerian: they are compiled by Akkadian or other speakers as guides for students who had to learn Sumerian as a second language, so they don't necessarily reflect the history of the language as it lived, only as it was written. Among other drawbacks this means we see the vocabulary of a mature language (including a lot of loan words from other languages) rathter than a 'pure' or 'primitive' version.

Second, Sumerian --like German -- is an agglutinative language where words can be jammed together to create neologisms. Which raises an interesting question in counting: does 'football' count as one word, or is it just a mini-phrase coined from one?
