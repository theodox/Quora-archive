# Ancient Greek: if one knows just enough vocabulary and grammar to read, say, Plato, does it mean he'll be able to read most of another author's works?

If you can get through Plato you’ll be able to manage most texts — the main obvious exception will be Homer, which is quite archaic and uses a lot of unusual vocabulary and offbeat constructions: the Iliad is at least as different from Plato as Shakespeare is from Hemingway — the difference may even be more like the difference between Hemingway and Chaucer.

For most of the literary history of Greece the Attic dialect (of Plato and his contemporaries) was the gold standard of Greek literacy — even though later Greek tended to simplify and homogenize classical Attic the key structures and vocabulary always looked back to the Athens of the classical period as a model.
