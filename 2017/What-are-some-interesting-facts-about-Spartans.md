You probably know about Spartan badassery, their [surprisingly equitable treatment of women](http://www.ancient.eu/article/123/), their [eugenics program](http://spartareconsidered.blogspot.com/2011/11/infanticide-in-sparta-and-athens.html), and their [impractical coinage](http://www.coinweek.com/featured-news/ancient-coins-sparta/).

But did you know the Spartans were _Jewish?_ 

Consider 1 Maccabees 12:5 et seq:

> 5. This is a copy of the letter that Jonathan wrote to the Spartans:

> “Jonathan the high priest, the senate of the nation, the priests, and the rest of the Jewish people send greetings to their brothers the Spartans. Long ago a letter was sent to the high priest Onias from Arius, who then reigned over you, stating that you are our brothers, as the attached copy shows. Onias welcomed the envoy with honor and received the letter, which spoke clearly of alliance and friendship. Though we have no need of these things, since we have for our encouragement the holy books that are in our possession. We have ventured to send word to you for the renewal of brotherhood and friendship, lest we become strangers to you; a long time has passed since you sent your message to us.

> We, on our part, have unceasingly remembered you in the sacrifices and prayers that we offer on our feasts and other appropriate days, as it is right and proper to remember brothers. We likewise rejoice in your renown.

> But many tribulations and many wars have beset us, and the kings around us have attacked us. We did not wish to be troublesome to you and to the rest of our allies and friends in these wars, for we have the help of Heaven for our support, and we have been saved from our enemies, and our enemies have been humbled.

> So we have chosen Numenius, son of Antiochus, and Antipater, son of Jason, and we have sent them to the Romans to renew with them the friendship and alliance of earlier times. We have also ordered them to come to you and greet you, and to deliver to you our letter concerning the renewal of our brotherhood.

> Therefore kindly send us an answer on this matter.”

> This is a copy of the letter that they sent to Onias:

> “Arius, king of the Spartans, sends greetings to Onias the high priest. A document has been found stating that the Spartans and the Jews are brothers and that they are of the family of Abraham. Now that we have learned this, kindly write to us about your welfare.

> We, for our part, declare to you that your animals and your possessions are ours, and ours are yours. We have, therefore, given orders that you should be told of this.”

This is actually less… surprising… than it seems at first glance

[The “discovery”, real or invented, of ancient kinship ties was a regular part of Hellenistic diplomacy](https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0292739591) — it’s why so many Mediterranean powers of the time turned out to be descended from, say, a minor character in the Trojan war or a lesser known by-blow of Zeus. As a follow-on, diplomatic protocol of the time also liked to “rediscover” old treaties as an invitation to new ones. It’s unclear how seriously this might have been regarded as documentary history; but as PR it was obviously prized. A modern analogy might be the way, say, French support for the American revolution suddenly becomes a topic for discussion when contemporary French and American interests are aligned for the moment.

Thus the form of the letter — a diplomatic feeler backed by a claim of ancient friendly relations — is vanilla diplomatic language for the time. Of course, its the historicity of the letter-within-a-letter, purportedly from the Spartans, that’s the _really_  interesting question. It seems to reflect the Hellenistic penchant for polite diplomatic fictions…

…but _whose?_ 

The [usual assumption](https://books.google.com/books?id=7tgXDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA162&pg=PA153#v=onepage&q&f=false) is that this is Jewish diplomacy embroidering a tale. However, it’s not impossible that the fiction started in Sparta rather Jerusalem. The Spartan king Areus I (reigned 309-265 BCE) was an energetic ruler who expanded Sparta’s diplomatic reach as he tried to counter the overwhelming power of the Macedonians in Greece. He campaigned in Crete and allied with the Ptolemies in Egypt — who were at that time allied with the Jews (about this time, Ptolemy II commissioned the first Greek translation of the Hebrew Torah).

In that context, an enterprising Spartan diplomat could have seized on the then-recent works of [Hecataeus of Abdera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecataeus_of_Abdera), a historian who claimed that all foreigners were expelled from Egypt at the time of the Exodus: most of the refugees followed Moses to Judea, but others — the “best and noblest” according to Hecataeus — went on to found Thebes and Argos. The Spartan kings claimed descent from Heracles, whose great-to-the-seventh grandfather was [Danaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danaus) : an Egyptian exile who settled in Argos. Add a little imagination and hey, cousins!

It there really was a letter from Sparta sitting the archives in Jerusalem a hundred years later, it would have offered the Maccabees a chance to polish their diplomatic credentials. Sparta was, by then, no longer a first rate power (that accounts for the diffident tone of the Maccabees’ correspondence) but it remained a cultural touchstone worth courting. Even today, diplomats seek support in unlikely places with little practical payoff, simply to strengthen their overall web of connections. And in this case there was _some_  kind of practical result — in 2 Maccabees the renegade Jewish High Priest Jason, driven out of Judea, ends up fleeing to a life in exile at Sparta.

So _there’s_  something most folks don’t know about the Spartans. Hitler — who adored the Spartans for their eugenics programs and warlike ways — clearly didn’t do his homework before declaring them “[Völkisch](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/634563-sparta-must-be-regarded-as-the-first-v-lkisch-state-the).”
