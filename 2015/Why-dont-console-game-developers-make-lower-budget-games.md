Plenty of developers make smaller games for consoles: [Playstation marketplace](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/home/main) and [Xbox Live Arcade](http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Games/XboxArcadeGames) both offer a lot of games in the $10-20 price range and they clearly set the player's expectations differently than a $60 box from a big electronics store. 

The critical question isn't graphics though: it's simply budget. You can make a very slick looking 3-d game with Unity for very little investment over making a 2-d side scroller. The hard part is finding the right combination of spend (to make content people will pay for) and save (by not doing things that won't make people want your titles: adding impressive real-time reflections to your racing game probably won't actually add much to your sales). An absolutely beautiful game like [Never Alone](http://Never Alone) can be made by a smallish team on a tight schedule thanks to off the shelf technology:

No matter how much you paid me :)

As [Ernest W. Adams](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ernest-W-Adams) points out the economics on console are complicate. Platform fees and publisher recoup account for most of the sale price: that $20 XBLA game probably nets way less than $5 to the actual developers. Moreover that's a fragmented market: unless you invest in cross platform development* you are limiting the audience for your little game to a subset of one console's audience. Moreover both of those platforms are immature: the audience and their expectations are still evolving, which is always scare for business. When we did [State of Decay](http://www.ign.com/games/state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition/xbox-one-20023993) on XBLA we exceeded out sales targets by a factor of 10x -- which is a nice feeling but it also indicates that the market is very unpredictable. Most XBLA games sell a few thousand copies a month during their core sales lifetime (which is usually a year or so). 

I'm not up on the numbers these days but when I was intensely following them in 2012/3, a "hit" game was probably moving 400,000 units on XBLA (not counting Minecraft, of course!). The big question is how much you can spend to make that sales target. The profit per download is strongly driven by the costs of development (see [If I create a moderately successful AAA game, will I become a millionaire?](https://www.quora.com/If-I-create-a-moderately-successful-AAA-game-will-I-become-a-millionaire)) The publisher will make back something like 1.5x their costs before developers see a penny of profit. 

So the question really boils down to how much do you spend to sell your 400,000 downloads for $8 million. If you go with 'standard practices' - hiring experienced developers, providing good benefits, etc -- you're probably talking $4 million.** So the platform holder gets something like $2 m, the publisher gets $6m, and after they are paid off there's basically no profit.

OK, so we'll cut the size of the game and use a smaller team and shorter dev cycle (assuming, of course, that we don't compromise the game so that it can't sell 400k units -- a big if!). If our budget is $2m instead of 4, the publisher now gets $3m. There's now $3 million of profit, which is probably split 3/1 in favor of the publisher: so we earn $750,000 profit. That's great!

Unfortunately the overwhelming majority of games don't earn out at all -- if you use the usual pessimistic industry guess that a game has about a 1-in-10 chance of success you are investing $2 million to earn an _average_  return of $75,000 -- a return on investment of about 3.75 %: what you'd get from a good stock pick. Of course nobody thinks their own game is average: the games industry only exists because developers are all gamblers at heart. But over time the law of averages can't be beaten -- that's why these markets don't grow faster.

So even a small game has a hard time in a fragmented market. That's why so many of the successful games in this space are more like mobile games than 'real' console titles: keeping budgets low is a survival imperative given how hard it is to make a buck between the platform holders and publishers. In a small-ish market that's much harder -- which is one of the reasons developers flock to things like Steam where the platform and publisher situations are much more fluid. The other big source of budget titles is ports and retreads --- since these games already exist and have clear identities it's very cost efficient to release things like _Plants Vs Zombies_  or _Peggle_  on a console at a budget price point.

Adding to all of the uncertainty is the fact that the online console stores are evolving rapidly: box sales are declining and more and more big titles are selling as direct downloads -- but the structure of the contracts hasn't caught up: publishers and platform holders still want the same kinds of cuts they wanted when they had to worry about moving container ships full of CDs. Hopefully some of the cost savings involved in cutting out physical distribution will trickle down to developers in the form or more profits -- but I'm not holding my breath.


_* doing the same game on two consoles used to be a really significant cost, although with the flood of_ _[Unity Engine](http://unity3d.com/5?gclid=Cj0KEQjwj_SvBRC7k4DfkLHiuMABEiQAvPOaqWiQP62GXbkoihWVdVaoaSvoox_7K0eZ9YowOuK41nYaAuyX8P8HAQ)_ _games out there that's less of a worry than it used to be. It's still a hassle, though, and doubles your sales-support and QA costs._ 

_** $4 million would support a professional team of 15 for 2 years, more or less. Real world numbers will vary considerably._
