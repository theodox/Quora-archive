Generally speaking people didn’t use serial dates on tombs (or many other things). In principle, educated Romans (at least) had the concept of a date _ab urbe condita_ , “since the founding of the city” which would be our 753 BC; however almost nobody used that as an orienting principle. If a fixed date was needed, the most common method would be to use the names of the consuls for the year; but even that pretty rare.

The usual formula would be something like this:

which reads:

_To the spirits of the dead 
[for[ Minucia Suavis
[wife of] P. Sextilis of Campania 
lived 14 years, 8 months 
23 days 
T. Claudius Suavis
most dutiful father [made this]_ 

“lived so many years”, along with the names of the family and of the person(s) who erected the memorial were the important parts for the Romans. Dating wasn’t a big part of their memorial culture.
