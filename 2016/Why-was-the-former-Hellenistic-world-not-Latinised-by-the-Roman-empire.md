Great answers from both [Dimitra Triantafyllidou](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dimitra-Triantafyllidou) and [User](https://www.quora.com/profile/User-397463) . I'd just add one item which is latent in both answers but deserves more emphasis: __literacy__ .

It's actually hard to root out a language: the persistence of tiny pockets of Greek speakers in Southern Italy, for example, or speakers of Gaelic in Ireland -- heck, the whole history of Basque since the Celts arrived in Iberia -- shows that languages are pretty tenacious. So I'd suggest that the question is a bit backwards: not _why didn't the East end up speaking Latin_  but _what happened to the languages of the west?_ 

The answer I think is pretty simple: Most of the pre-Roman west was illiterate; most of the pre-Roman east was not. In the Greek east, there were multiple competing literate cultures: Not just Greek but also Aramaic/Syriac, Egyptian, Armenian and Hebrew. All of these languages have their own literatures (all of which predate the Roman conquest and for that matter the conquests of Alexander). 

Of course, not everybody in the east was personally literate -- but you have to remember our sources are overwhelmingly biased toward the written word and so the unlettered majority is literally silenced. Many languages - even those which had a lot of living speakers - drop out of the record because whatever they had to say was not written down, or was written down in somebody else's script. Languages like Thracian, Illyrian or Cilician which never, as far as we know, evolved a vernacular literature of their own we know only from accounts given by Greek-literate authors.* And of course we don't always know what people spoke at home: [Lucian of Samosata,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian) for example, is a well known "Greek" writer, but he was in fact an Assyrian who spoke a 'barbarous tongue' (his words) at home -- probably Aramaic. But on paper, he's Graecized. But he clearly knew his own roots; the same could be said for a Babylonian like [Berossus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berossus) and Egyptian like [Manetho,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho) or a Jew like [Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus). 

The existence of a written literature gives a language staying power in two ways: first, it provides the literate classes with a concrete embodiment of their traditions. Second - and maybe more important for our perceptions -- it leaves records we can still see.

In the west, neither of those factors is as powerful as in the east: while there were bits and pieces of native literacy west of the Adriatic (Etruscan is the obvious standout). It's a bit of an exaggeration to say that Gaul and Iberia knew letters only through Greek or Carthaginian colonies -- but only a bit.** Which means, of course, that whatever they were speaking among themselves we only hear of it insofar as it its recorded by a Latin author. The situation was probably rendered more stark by the Roman suppression of druidic practice in Gaul and Britain, since the druids were the guardians of a fragile oral tradition.

The Punic areas are a bit of an anomaly here, since they could write. Punic characters are still in use in North Africa in the form of Berber [Tifinagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifinagh). A few educated people of Punic descent continued to use Punic fairly late: [Juba II ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II)of Mauretania, noted for his scientific works in Greek and Latin, also issued coins with Punic inscriptions in the first century. Much later, Punic was still the language of the Algerian countryside when St. Augustine was a young man (his mother may have spoken it at home). Even in southern Spain some trace of the Punic influence lingered: in another Quora answer one of the commenters passed on a Spanish martyr text from probably the fifth century where two Christian women were killed for refusing to worship a Phoenician idol.***

In the rest of the west, however, literacy, wealth, "civilization" and Latin were all the same thing. Which made it far easier for the older cultures -- most notably the Celtic cultures which stretched in one form or another from Spain to the Ukraine -- to disappear from our records with very little trace. This doesn't mean those languages or cultures disappeared completely - only that they rarely intrude into the small sphere of politics, religion, law and literature which dominates our sources.

 It's also true, though, that Roman colonization had a significant impact: settling veterans not only as individuals but as organized communities, complete with cookie-cutter Roman institutions and laws, spread Roman culture into the western hinterlands very effectively. Not only did it bring a lot of Latin speakers into new areas it also made 'learning Latin' and 'economic opportunity' synonymous in places which had little previous experience of commerce. (The same thing happened in the Balkans too : one reason for the [Jireƒçek Line)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jire%C4%8Dek_Line). In the east, denser settlement and older patterns of urbanization made it harder to really impact the demographics or to turn Latin into a vital necessity for locals already literate in Greek or Aramaic. 



*you might actually count [Ancient Macedonian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Macedonian_language)as another "fader".

** the [Iberian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_language#Greco-Iberian_alphabet) wiki page has some examples of Iberian and Tartessian scripts -- but the total amount of material is miniscule

*** It's also possible that Punic was gradually re-absorbed in the Aramaic world too: there is evidence of family conections between North Africa and the Levant quite late (the Severan dynasty, for example, originated in Africa but had a branch in Syria). It's well known that the economy of post-Roman Gaul and Spain had a significant quotient of what were called 'Syrian' merchants -- but were they really from Syria?
