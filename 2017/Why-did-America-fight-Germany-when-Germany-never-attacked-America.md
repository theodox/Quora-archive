Well, lets start off with the fact tha [Hitler declared war on the USA](http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/adolf-hitler-declaration-war-usa-1941/) on December 11, 1941.

_Hitler declaring war, December 11 1941_ 

And the claim that Germany never attacked the US is also incorrect: by December 1941 German submarines had already sunk the merchant ship [SS Robin Moor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Robin_Moor), and made torpedo attacks on the [USS Greer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Greer_(DD-145)), the [USS Reuben James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Reuben_James_(DD-245)), and the [USS Kearny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Kearny_(DD-432)).
