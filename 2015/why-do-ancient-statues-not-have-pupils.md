Some of them do. The Sumerians, for example, tended to take it a bit _too_  far:

But many larger classical statues have carved ones (often designed to catch the light rather than as anatomically correct models, since the cornea would shade wrong in solid marble).

For bronzes, it was quite common to use inlays - ivory, particularly -- for eyeballs. This could in turn have a bronze or iron inlay or painted details.

As the other answer noted, in marble statues eyes were often painted.
