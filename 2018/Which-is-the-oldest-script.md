It’s a tough question to answer because the line between a real script and a more limited set of symbols or tally-marks is pretty fuzzy.

Egyptian hieroglyphs and Sumerian cuneiform are the top contenders for the title of oldest. Both of them transitioned from symbols and accounting tricks to writing systems that could express novel ideas in the last half of the fourth millennium BC (some time between 3500 and 3000).

Probably the oldest example of symbols that were later used for writing is the [Kish tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish_tablet) from Sumeria, from right around 3500 BC. It is still using pictographs — not yet the true cuneiform writing which emerged a few centuries later — but the pictures are already conventionalized and are the direct ancestors of the simplified glyphs that became cuneiform writing.

The same process is at work in these ivory tags from the tomb of the enigmatic early Pharaoh known as Scorpion I

Again, these are not writing (you’ll note they are all only one or two signs) but these images will become true hieroglyphic writing within a couple of centuries.

There are a few examples of artifacts that _might_  be writing but aren’t deciphered so we can’t be sure. The most famous case is that of the [Vinča symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_symbols) from the Balkans, which date back at to around 5,300 BC.

While they look like writing we have made little progress in deciphering them (it’s extremely hard to decipher writing when you don’t know what language the symbols represent). They might also be a proto-writing which never completed the transition to a full script. They do, however, predate both Egyptian and Mesopotamian writing by almost two millennia.
