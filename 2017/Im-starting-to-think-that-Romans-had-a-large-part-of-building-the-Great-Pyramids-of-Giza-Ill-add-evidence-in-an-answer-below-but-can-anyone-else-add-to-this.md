# I'm starting to think that Romans had a large part of building the Great Pyramids of Giza (I'll add evidence in an answer below), but can anyone else add to this?

Sorry, no: the Great Pyramid predates the Roman Republic by 2,000 years. The Pyramids were well known as “ancient” [when the Romans were just learning how to build with stone](https://newrepublic.com/article/116396/archaeologists-have-found-oldest-roman-temple). Greek traveller Herodotus wrote about the Pyramids and how ancient they were when he visited Egypt in the first half of the fifth century BC, when Rome was an [insignificant village nobody in the Greek world had ever heard of.](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-ancient-Hellenic-references-to-the-Roman-Republic-before-the-Punic-Wars)

The Pyramid of Cestius — like the [Isis temple in Pompeii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Isis_(Pompeii)), or Greek writer Plutarch’s [account of the story of Isis and Osiris](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0239%3Asection%3D1) — is testimony to the vogue for Egyptian styles which started with Alexandrian Greeks and spread to Rome in the century or so after the Roman conquest of Egypt. It’s why you see the occasional [Roman mummy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayum_mummy_portraits). But it’s not a big threat to the established chronology.
