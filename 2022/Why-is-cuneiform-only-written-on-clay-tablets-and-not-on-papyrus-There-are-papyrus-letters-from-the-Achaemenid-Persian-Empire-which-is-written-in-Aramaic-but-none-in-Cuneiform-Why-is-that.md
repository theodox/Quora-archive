# Why is cuneiform only written on clay tablets and not on papyrus? There are papyrus letters from the Achaemenid Persian Empire which is written in Aramaic, but none in Cuneiform. Why is that?

There were examples of cuneiform writing on other materials.

Metal could be written on with metal punches, but this was labor intensive. Wood, silk, and pottery fragments could be written on using a paint brush, but the transition was not trivial, since ordinary cuneiform characters are formed with a wedge pressed into clay and mimicking those strokes with a brush is hard. In any case, wood and silk are much less durable than clay tablets — our surviving tablets are usually a side effect of fires, which baked the clay on which they written into, effectively, ceramics. The same fires (along with insects, mold, and other cruelties of the environment) don’t spare wood or silk so we have virtually no surviving examples.

The most common everyday writing material was not clay — it was wax tablets, usually in the form of bound notebooks with two or three leaves. These were cheap and effective and could be written on using the same kind of stylus used for tablets. If you were sending a letter in Akkadian you’d almost certainly send a wax tablet rather than a heavier piece of clay. Unfortunately for us, the wax was not very survivable and the tablets themselves were designed to re-used, so even they don’t retain any messages for us.

The two panels would have been filled with wax, and letters or notes would be written on the wax with a metal stylus. This was a common method of day-to-day writing — this particular example might have been used to write Linear B, cuneiform, or Ugaritic.

Papyrus was available in the cuneiform world but it had to be imported. Byblos in Phoenicia was the center of the papyrus trade outside of Egypt ([hence the name “Bible”](https://www.quora.com/Where-does-the-word-%E2%80%9CBible%E2%80%9D-come-from-and-what-does-it-mean/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=62936958&share=42ce7ae6&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer)). It didn’t fall under the control of a cuneiform-using Mesopotamian state until the 9th century BC — well after Aramaic had begun replacing cuneiform as the writing medium of everyday life. It didn’t help that papyrus is not an ideal writing surface if you want to reproduce cuneiform character shapes — the rough texture makes the tricky task of inking a shape that originated with a stylus press even harder. Papyrus encourages scribes to adopt loopy, cursive scripts rather than the staccato punch-push rhythm of clay. It’s significant that when the government of New Kingdom Egypt [maintained a cuneiform-literate chancery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarna_letters) they used clay tablets, rather than papyrus — presumably even these Egyptians, with supplies ready to hand, still found clay more efficient for their purposes.

To sum up: cuneiform on papyrus is rare because (a) there were cheap alternatives, (b) it’s not a great writing medium for cuneiform characters and (c) by the time papyrus was readily available in Mesopotamia, papyrus-friendly Aramaic was replacing cuneiform as a language of informal communications.
