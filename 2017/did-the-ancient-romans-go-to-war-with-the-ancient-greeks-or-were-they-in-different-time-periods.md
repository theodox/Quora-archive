They always overlapped: Rome had already become a republic before the Greeks fought the Persians, and the Romans got their letters from the Greek colonies in southern Italy.

Rome conquered the Greek cities of Italy and Sicily piecemeal between about 350 and 200 BC. This was the result of a lot of conflicts between many different groups; the Greco-Italian cities were not united and fought each other as often as they fought the Romans or other Italians. The Romans allied with different cities at different times. The last big conflict here came during [Hannibal’s invasion of Italy](https://www.ancient.eu/Second_Punic_War/), when several of the leading Greek cities (in particular Syracuse in Sicily, which had usually been a Roman ally) sided with Hannibal and were conquered once and for all.

After Rome defeated Carthage it was the most powerful state in the western Mediterranean. As such, it got involved in the complex power-politics of the rest of the Greek world — which at that time included large kingdoms based in Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt, and Mesopotamia as well as dozens of smaller city-states. Different Greek groups allied with Rome against their Greek enemies; usually it was smaller states looking from protection from larger kingdoms. This lasted from around 200 BC to the time of [Augustus Caesar](https://www.ancient.eu/augustus/), who conquered (Greek) Egypt after [Cleopatra](https://www.ancient.eu/Cleopatra_VII/) backed the other side in a Roman civil war.
