Even assuming there was anything left of the library — despite the [burning of the original library by Julius Caesar’s troops in 47BC, the book-burning party of Caracalla in 215 AD, and the leveling of the entire region of the city where the library stood in 275 AD](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-responsible-for-the-destruction-of-the-library-of-Alexandria) — it would be extremely surprising if there were any actual books there:
