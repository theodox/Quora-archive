The Assyrians were pretty fanatical record keepers, and although there are debates about the chronology of different reigns the records seem to be historic (without the interpolation of gods or mythical figures) at least back to roughly 2000 BC.*

The oldest king in the standard [Assyrian King List ](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/anet/564-566-the-assyrian-king-list/)who is archaeologically attested is [Shalim-Ahum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalim-ahum), who appears in a single inscription made during his own reign (not online, unfortunately). Shalim-Ahum occupies the 31st place in the standard Assyrian king list. His grandson [Erishum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erishum_I), roughly 1974–1935 BC is # 33 in the king list and is well attested.

The stretch of the King List from Erishum to [Shamsi-Adad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamshi-Adad_I) (1809–1776, #39) and [Ishme-Dagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishme-Dagan) (1776 —1736, #40) is a bit dicey — not all of the rulers in this section have contemporary evidence but where we have it, it’s quite clearly historical: the letters of Shamsi-Adad to his sons Ishme-Dagan and [Yashmah-Adad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasmah-Adad) are often uncomfortably human:

> Your brother has won a great victory in the east… you remain there, reclining amongst the women. Can’t you behave like a man? Your brother has made a great name for himself; you should do the same in your own land!

and

> Take heed of the old proverb: ‘The bitch is in such a hurry that she bears blind puppies,’ and don’t you act in the same way!

(more letters [here](https://www.ganino.com/files/letters_from_mesopotamia.pdf)**)

From that point forward the records are increasingly good up to the reign of [Ashur-Dan I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashur-dan_I) (1178–1134 BC, king # 83). There are sometimes conflicting records of regnal years; there’s also evidence for usurpations, civil wars, and proxy rulers supported by outside power — but these seem to reflect competing dynastic claims or sometimes different scribal traditions, not anything supernatural.

We have some external checks Assyrian kings in the Babylonian [Synchonic Chronicle](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/mesopotamian-chronicles-content/abc-21-synchronic-chronicle/) — the oldest one is for [Ashur-Bel-Nisheshu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashur-bel-nisheshu) (1417–1409 BC, king #69). Its reasonable to assume that everyone in the list from that point on is historic. In any case you can count with a very high degree of certainty on any Assyrian king from [Shalmanesser III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalmaneser_III) (858–824 BC) onward, since after that point the surviving Assyrian king lists can be cross-checked in whole or in part against Babylonian or other records and they line up well: there’s no easy way to sneak in some kind of mythical figure down to [Ashur-Uballit II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashur-uballit_II), the last king, and the dates also appear pretty reliable.

Before about 2000 BC, we have only the word of much later Assyrian scribes, and no easy way to verify what they tell us. The first 17 kings in the list are known as “kings who lived in tents”, presumably, nomadic clan chiefs known only through oral tradition. The next 10 are “kings who were ancestors,” and may be inserted by the whims of scribes of later eras to legitimize dynastic claims. None of the first 30 kings in the traditional list left any contemporary records. It’s worth noting, though, that none of them is identified as a god or mythological being — they all appear to have been seen as human royalty and not divine progenitors, despite the bombastic tone of a lot of Assyrian self-presentation.



*Dates older than the 9th century are often debated; I’m using the “middle chronology” dates throughout.
**Unfortunately there’s no good online collection of the Shamsi-Adad letters from Mari. Nonetheless the “voice” of that particular relationship comes through with remarkable clarity over the distance of 37 centuries. _Why can’t you be a mensch like your brother?_
