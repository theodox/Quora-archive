It does seem like Egyptian horses were smaller than their modern descendants, but that’s not necessarily why chariots were popular.

Egyptian chariots are usually assumed to appear along with the [Hyksos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyksos), a Semitic people who dominated Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period starting around 1650 BC. The early Hyksos models used a 4-spoke wheel

But Egyptians soon invented a more flexible six-spoke wheel which gave a superior ride and was well adapted to mobile archery.

The wheels found in King Tut’s tomb ranged from 80 to 97cm in diameter. Egyptian artists usually depict chariot wheel rims right around the stifle of the horses.

_Ahmenhotep III, (1388–1351 BC) Note where the rim is relative to the horse’s girth._ 

If you go by these illustrations, the bottom of the horse’s chest or barrel is about 85% of the height of the wheels. By my completely unscientific calculations, that gives something between 13 and 16 hands. The oldest known horse remains from Egypt, the so-called “[Buhen Horse](https://www.academia.edu/3039205/The_Buhen_Horse_Fifty_Years_after_Its_Discovery_1958_2008_)” are believed to be 14 and half hands high, so right in that ballpark.

_If you compare the ancient illustrations to modern re-enactor photos you’ll notice that the wheel rims are now roughly level with the horse’s belly, rather than above it — suggesting a bigger horse._ 

Horses in that size range are similar to a modern Mongolian horse, which is to say not too small to carry a rider. There are not many images of Egyptians on horseback as there are on chariots, but there are a few:

Why are chariots more popular than cavalry? It’s probably because they were intended as archery platforms. Horse archery is a very hard skill to master — it’s almost always found among nomadic peoples who essentially live in the saddle. Egyptian society was proudly sedentary, so the number of people with with necessary skills would be quite small. A chariot — particularly as two-man chariot, as the Egyptian versions always were, splits the very difficult job of riding from the very difficult job of shooting and reloading on the move. This offers most of the tactical benefits of horse archery without the terrible burden of training. If you’re an aristocrat, it also has the side-benefit of splitting out the inglorious work of simply navigating around from the prestigious work of fighting, a distinction you see for example in the _Iliad,_ the or the _Song of Cu Chulainn._ 



Not necessarily apropos, but if you’re planning on building your own chariot [this link ](https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute/courses/fightingpharaohs10/9985.html)is a great guide.
