One thing you have to remember is that oratory was first and foremost a performance art.

We have a lot Cicero’s works — he’s both one of the most prolific writers of Latin prose and history was very kind to his catalog. So we know what kind of a writer he was. However we don’t have a lot of first-hand testimony to the thing that his contemporaries would have seen as setting him apart: his delivery, his timing, his gestures, and his command of his own voice — judging them that way is exactly like trying to rate a rapper entirely on written lyrics without any idea of how they were in front of a crowd

_Was Cicero another Biggie Smalls? Or just Vanilla Ice? Could you tell only from the lyrics?_ 

As a practical matter, we should note that his contemporaries (who were certainly more likely to be good judges than we are, at two millennia’s remove) generally gave him pretty high marks. Here’s Plutarch’s judgement, from a remove of about a century and a half:

> Moreover, as [Cicero] grew older and applied himself with greater versatility to such accomplishments, he got the name of being not only the best orator, but also the best poet among the Romans. 5 His fame for oratory abides to this day, although there have been great innovations in style; but his poetry, since many gifted poets have followed him, has altogether fallen into neglect and disrepute.

and later

> [His Greek tutor] requested Cicero to declaim in Greek, with which request Cicero readily complied, thinking that in this way his faults could better be corrected. After he had declaimed, his other hearers were astounded and vied with one another in their praises, but Apollonius was not greatly moved while listening to him, and when he had ceased sat for a long time lost in thought; then, since Cicero was distressed at this, he said: "Thee, indeed, O Cicero, I admire and commend; but Greece I pity for her sad fortune, since I see that even the only glories which were left to us, culture and eloquence, are through thee to belong also to the Romans."

Which, coming from a Greek (and a bit of a Greek cultural chauvinist at that) is pretty high praise, particularly for a member in the losing side of the great civil wars that ended the Republic.

In the courts he was very successful as well, so he must have been doing something right. He won his first big public victory — the prosecution of [Verres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verres) — against the leading Roman advocate of his day, [Quintus Hortensius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Hortensius); a splashy victory for a political outsider against a well connected and well-heeled defendant. The success of his political career also suggests that his skills were pretty widely acknowledged in his own day — not only was it extremely rare for an outsider of modest means to become a consul, he did it without a binding alliance to any of Rome’s prominent political clans. His only real power based was his ability to sway a crowd, particularly the conservative equestrian voters who feared populist rabble-rousing but didn’t want to kowtow to aristocratic pretensions either.

So, it’s tough to form our own judgement but the record seems pretty clear that his contemporaries thought quite highly of his oratory. In the aftermath of Caesar’s death his voice was, briefly, the most persuasive and broadly popular as the city waited to see what would happen; Appian said that at that time “Cicero had been as close to being the sole ruler as a popular speaker could become.”

Alone of the politicians of his generation, Cicero fought the last battles of the Republic [entirely with words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippicae), rather than private armies. His eloquence was enough of a threat that Marc Antony not only had him killed felt compelled to preen about it:

> When, however, the head of Cicero also was brought to them one day (he had been overtaken and slain in flight), Antony uttered many bitter reproaches against it and then ordered it to be exposed on the rostra more prominently than the rest, in order that it might be seen in the very place where Cicero had so often been heard declaiming against him, together with his right hand, just as it had been cut off. And Fulvia took the head into her hands before it was removed, and after abusing it spitefully and spitting upon it, set it on her knees, opened the mouth, and pulled out the tongue, which she pierced with the pins that she used for her hair, at the same time uttering many brutal jests
