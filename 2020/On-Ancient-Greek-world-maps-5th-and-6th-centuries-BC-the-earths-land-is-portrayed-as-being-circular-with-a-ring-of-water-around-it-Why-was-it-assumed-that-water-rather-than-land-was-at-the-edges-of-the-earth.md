# On Ancient Greek world maps (5th and 6th centuries BC), the earth's land is portrayed as being circular with a ring of water around it. Why was it assumed that water rather than land was at the edges of the earth?

It’s a literalist interpretation Homer, who describes the river “[Okeanos](https://www.theoi.com/Kosmos/Okeanos.html)” as encircling the world.

> The enormous strength of Okeanos with his deep-running waters, Okeanos, from whom all rivers are and the entire sea and all springs and all deep wells have their waters of him.

There is however no certainty that Homer envisioned this as a proposition in geography at all. The line between rivers and river gods is pretty fuzzy in Homer, whose hero actually fight against the river Scamander in book XXI of the _Iliad:_ 

> Even as [the River-god] spoke, Achilles, the great spearman, leapt from the bank into the heart of the stream. [Scamander] stirred the waters to fury, and rushed on him in spate, bellowing like a bull, sweeping up the host of dead that choked his river-bed, and hurling them on shore. But the living he protected with his dark waters, concealing them among the wide deep pools. The raging current rose against Achilles, beating his shield down and driving him back, so he could barely stand. He clutched at a fine tall elm, but it tore away at the roots, pulling down the bank and collapsing into the flood, sinking deep and damming the whole river. Now Achilles sprang for the shore, and set off running swiftly over the plain, gripped by fear. The River-god came on, as a dark wall of water, meaning to end Achilles’ slaughter and save the Trojans from ruin.

Scamander the river god was a son of Okeanos. It’s likely that Homer simply meant to make a mythological point: along with his wife [Tethys](https://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanisTethys.html#:~:text=TETHYS%20was%20the%20Titan%20goddess,and%20the%20Nephelai%20(Clouds).) Okeanos is the mythological “father” of all rivers — an idea which might ultimately derive from the Mesopotamian myth of [Abzu and Tiamat](https://www.ancient.eu/article/221/the-mesopotamian-pantheon/), another pair of water-parent deities.

In any event Homer’s conceit did not take long to become the literalized. Homer’s description of the [shield of Achilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield_of_Achilles) in book XVIII of the _Iliad (_ [text here](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Iliad18.php#anchor_Toc239246226)_)_ is a metaphorical description of his world view — it’s drawn on a round Greek shield whose rim represents Okeanos. That image was sufficiently vivid that it was picked up and repeated by later poets — for example Hesiod:

> And about the shield rim ran the stream of Okeanos, looking like a flood tide, and held together all the elaborate shield, and upon it swans, some soaring and singing a high song, while many others swam on the water surface where fish swarmed away before them.

Thus the maybe-metaphorical circular river turned literal. Hesiod elsewhere has Jason and the Argonauts sailing up the river Phasis (at the extreme eastern end of the Black Sea) until it joined Okeanos, then sailing around the rim of the world to “Libya” (that is Africa), and finally portaging their ship overland back to the Mediterranean. This might reflect real-world plans for a canal connecting the Red Sea to the lower Nile, which [Pharaoh Necho II tried to build shortly after Hesiod’s time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_of_the_Pharaohs). Or it might just be somebody pondering that circular shield and thinking, “you know, if you could get there….”

In any case, the idea of an all-encircling Okeanos survived long after the sphericity of the earth was generally accepted (say, by the 4th century BC). the Many Greek and Roman maps assumed that Eurasia occupied one quarter of the globe and that other landmasses, if any were separated from their world by water.

… which of course is where we get the English word “Ocean” from.
