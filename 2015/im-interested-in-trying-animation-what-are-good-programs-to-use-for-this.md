On the software side you might want to try [Synfig Studio](http://www.synfig.org/cms/), which is free.

For a smallish outlay you might want to check out [Anime Studio](http://my.smithmicro.com/anime-studio-debut-trial.html) -- the 'debut' version runs about $50 It's designed for stylized 2-D animation. Quick intro video:






Disclaimer: I don't have significant first hand experience with this, so I'm just pointing it out not "endorsing". But it seems like what you're asking for. 

The real pros often use [Toon Boom Harmony](https://www.toonboom.com/products/harmony), which is much more expensive.

All of these are available for Mac and PC

As far as tablets go, there's a big difference between the pressure sensitive digitizers used by most professional artists and the capacitative sensors on iPads. An iPad tracks with less accuracy and doesn't register differences in pen angle or pressure. The immediacy is nice but it's not great for serious work, especially not detailed work.

You can mitigate this somewhat with a [Wacom Intuos Creative Stylus](http://amzn.to/1f2Q3Nq) (about $25) which mimics the pressure sensitivity of a 'real' tablet like the [Intuos Pro Tablet](http://amzn.to/1MXbeza) (~$250). Make sure if you find a cheaper tablet than the Intuous to research how good the pressure response is - it's probably the biggest differentiator among tablets. Most of the cheapie ones in office supply stores are not pressure sensitive.
