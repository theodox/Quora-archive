There are three things you can’t repeat often enough about this:

“The Great” wasn’t some kind of special achievement in the historical Xbox. The modern habit of adding numbers to differentiate holders of the same name (“Elizabeth II” or “Benedict XV”) is a pretty recent one. Before that, if you wanted to pick out one particular ruler out of a series with the same name, you used a nickname to distinguish him or her — “[Louis the Fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_VI_of_France)” or “[Henry the Fowler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_the_Fowler)”. Alexander was “the Great” because he was the Alexander of Macedon everybody had heard of (in contrast to say, [Alexander II ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Macedon)who only hung on for a couple of years and never even earned a nickname).

In both Latin and Greek, Alexander’s “great” was a synonym of “big” or “important”, not “virtuous” or “excellent” — it’s the Great in “Great Britain”, not the great in “what a great guy!”

If you’ve been following the Quora feeds of late it should be obvious that expansionism , imperialism, and generally taking people’s lives or stuff on specious pretexts has not really gone out of fashion.
