# Taharqa is termed as the Black Pharaoh of ancient Egypt. He was from the so-called Ethiopian dynasty that ruled Egypt. Did Ethiopians really conquer and rule Egypt in ancient times?

Tarharqa is a real historical figure, but he’s not exactly what we would call an Ethiopian.

In modern terms he’d be what we’d call Sudanese; his family ruled from the city of [Napata,](http://www.ancientpages.com/2015/12/30/ancient-great-city-of-napata-in-the-kingdom-of-kush/) about 250 miles north of modern Khartoum. in ancient times he would have been known as a Nubian or a Kushite (Nubia describes the region; Kush was one of the states in the region).

The confusion arises from the fact that the Greek geographical vocabulary was pretty vague. Greek and Roman use “Aethiopians” as a general word for people from the Horn of Africa — but also, more loosely, for any people who seemed dark-skinned to a particular writer. There’s a story in the New Testament, for example, about an “Aethiopian” eunuch who meets the apostle Phillip on the road to Gaza. The eunuch is identified as the treasurer of the [Kandake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandake), the “Queen of Aethiopia,” — but that’s actually the royal title of the Nubian realm of [Meroë,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB) a much later successor of the kingdom ruled by Taharqa and his family.

__The Kushite Dynasty__ 

In any case, the [25th dynasty of Egypt](http://www.livius.org/articles/dynasty/25-dynasty-nubians/) were Nubians from Kush.

The Nubian conquest came during a low point in Egypt. The country was split into warring factions, and largely ruled by Libyans rather than Egyptians. This map is approximate, but it gives a good idea of how fragmented Egypt was prior to the Nubian invasion:

The Kushite kingdom was a major force in Egypt’s confused affairs in the middle of the 8th century BC. Kushite king [Kashta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashta) was powerful enough that he could arrange for his daughter [Amenirdis ](http://www.unesco.org/culture/museum-for-dialogue/item/en/79/statue-of-the-divine-adoratrice-of-amun-amenirdis-i)to be adopted into the ruling house of Thebes. She became “God’s wife of Amun,” and part of the family of [the last Egyptian who had ruled the entire country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osorkon_III). This connection provided legitimacy for later Nubian claims on Egypt.

The first Nubian conqueror of Egypt was [Piye](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/piye-or-pianchi/) (reigned 741- 716 BC). He assumed direct control of Thebes and the rest of Upper Egypt, though it’s not clear if this was achieved by violence or through the influence his kingdom already had through its alliance. In either case, the other factions in Egypt did not like the sudden appearance of a new power and they banded together against Piye. He defeated them soundly and firmly established his kingdom as the most powerful of the many Egyptian factions.

It’s important to point out that the Kushites already had longstanding cultural and religious ties with Egypt: they didn’t appear suddenly as unfamiliar barbarians. They were very familiar with Egyptian art, architecture and religion; their rule was always portrayed as being part of, rather than a break from, Egyptian tradition.

The Kushite dynasty consolidated its control over Egypt in the reign of [Shabaka ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabaka)(705–690 BC). Shabaka left a statue of himself at Karnak wearing the traditional Two Crowns, a symbol that he had united Egypt for the first time in over a century.

Shabaka also seems to have positioned himself as a protector of Egypt against outside forces. The Assyrian empire was becoming more and more powerful, threatening Egypt’s traditional client states in Canaan and the Levant, so it’s possible that ordinary Egyptians were more concerned about the truly alien power to the east than the more familiar Kushites.

However, the Kushite pharoahs faced a very serious challenge. The [biblical complaint](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-36-6/)

> Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.

refers to either Shabaka or Taharqa, and it reflects the (quite correct) perception that Egypt could not stand up to Assyria.

Taharqa succeeded Shabaka in 690, but the surviving records leave a lot of questions. Some modern scholars believe that Taharqa dethroned Shabaka, rather than succeeding him peacefully. Years of proxy-wars in Canaan and the Levant turned into a direct conflict during the 670s; in 671 the Assyrian emperor [Esarhaddon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esarhaddon) defeated Taharqa and captured Memphis.

Tarharqa retreated to Upper Egypt to continue the fight, but the Assyrians had the upper hand. Over the next decade Assyrian and Kushite forces battled on and off in Egypt, with different Egyptian factions supporting each of the foreign emperors. The last Kushite pharaoh was [Tantamani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantamani), who was driven out by the Egyptian [Psamtik I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psamtik_I). The last vestiges of Nubian control in Egypt were over by 656.*



_* Psamtik began his career as an Assyrian puppet — but as as the Assyrian empire imploded during the 630’s Psamtik became fully independent and Egypt was, for the time being, united again under a local dynasty until the_ _[Persian conquest in 525](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Dynasty_of_Egypt)_ _._ 

_Interestingly, Psamtik legitimized his own rule much the same way Piye had: he had his own daughter,_ _[Nitocris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitocris_I_(Divine_Adoratrice))_ _, adopted as God’s wife of Amun by the last Nubian God’s Wife._
