Very much “pro”

To be fair they never interacted with a culture that didn’t practice slavery— it was a completely non-controversial part of life in antiquity and opposition to the institution of slavery was basically nonexistent.

Ultimately warfare was the prime contributor to slavery— a successful campaign was expected to end with large numbers of slaves coming home with the victorious army. This was hardly an attitude unique to Romans in antiquity. As a very successful military power, the Romans were the most prosperous slave-takers of their era. The aftermath of really big conflicts, like the long series of wars with Carthage, brought enough slave labor into Italy to permanently alter the economic foundation of the peninsula.

There were lively discussions about the morality of different _behaviors_ among masters — but that’s very different from opposition to slavery. A good modem analogy would be attitudes about policing: most people think there ought to be restraints on how police officers use their power; very few people seriously think there ought not to be police.
