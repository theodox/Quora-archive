The breadth and verve of the answers almost restores the faith in humanity I lost contemplating how much ingenuity we've wasted on knocking each other off.

Here's a few esoteric ones: This __Ox Powered Paddlewheel Assault Craft__  comes from the later 4th century treatise [De rebus bellicis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_rebus_bellicis) (On Military Matters). All that Decline and Fall stuff didn't keep people from coming up with clever ways to kill each other:

__[Greek Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_fire.html)__  was the first historically documented flamethrower: a compound of some kind of petroleum product, it was particularly deadly at sea because it floated as well as sticking to wooden ships:

Equally Greek and even hotter, __[Archimedes's Burning Mirrors](http://history.howstuffworks.com/historical-figures/archimedes-death-ray2.htm)__  used parabolic reflectors to set fire to the Roman fleet besieging Syracuse (same Archimedes as the claw mentioned in connection to the claw: a very versatile genius).

It combined battering rams, siege ladders and catapults in a giant mobile tower of a scale never attempted before or since (unless you count the crawler that carried the Apollo rockets to the launchpad). It was 20 meters wide and 40 meters tall and took 3,400 soldiers to move it using a system of pullies and winches. It was however destroyed at the [Siege of Rhodes (305 BC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Rhodes_%28305_BC%29) when Diognetus, the city architect of the besieged town, arranged to flood the field on which the massive tower was slowly advancing towards the doomed city, miring the giant boondogle in mud and sewage. There's a great fictional account in Sprague De Camp's [The Bronze God of Rhodes](http://www.amazon.com/The-Bronze-Rhodes-Sprague-Camp/dp/161242144X). The money for the famous colossus of Rhodes was raised by selling the timber and iron from the defunct wonder-weapon.
