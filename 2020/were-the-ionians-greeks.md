Yes. “Ionians” are a subset of Greek-speakers; they spoke one of the [four ancient dialects of Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_dialects). Variations on the name “Ionian” are the standard way people all over the ancient world referred to all Greeks; for example in Persian the Greeks were _yauna_  and in Hebrew they are the _yavanim._ 

According to Greek tradition, the Ionians were essentially refugees from mainland Greece who emigrated to Asia Minor at some point after the so-called [Dorian invasion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_invasion) Some historians think they represent the most direct inheritors of the Myceneaean civilization after it collapsed at the end of the Bronze Age. However the evidence is pretty scanty, and the entire “Dorian Invasion” idea of often dismissed as an invention of Greek mythographers so it’s hard to be sure.

Of course, as often in antiquity we use language as a proxy for what in modern times we’d call ethnicity — there’s a high likelihood that a lot of Ionian speakers in, say, Miletus or Ephesus who thought of themselves as Hellenes because they spoke Ionian Greek were actually descended from Lydians or Carians or other people native to Anatolia.
