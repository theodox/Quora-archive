Even before twitter, it was hard to fight civil wars against two different brothers and a sister (poisoning one brother and getting your boyfriend to have the sister executed) without generating a _little_ controversy. Indeed, this would mark you out as something of a drama queen in any era.

Shacking up with two different married Roman generals also raised a few eyebrows.

Cleopatra didn’t just run into issues with Romans. She clashed with her Jewish subjects and with the Hasmoneans in Judea. Josephus cites his anti-semitic arch enemy Apion like this:

> [he] also makes mention of Cleopatra, the last Queen of Alexandria; and abuses us, because she was ungrateful to us.

and later

> Nay when, last of all, Cæsar had taken Alexandria, she came to that pitch of cruelty, that she declared she had some hope of preserving her affairs still, in case she could kill the Jews, though it were with her own hand.

On a more mundane level, she was apparently socially controversial during her stay in Rome with Caesar. Cicero at, at least, complained about her imperious manners (“the insolence of the queen herself, when she was in her villa across the river, I cannot mention without great indignation.”) but he also seems to have felt that she promised to loan him a book and then reneged, leaving him feeling disappointed and disrespected.

Later on, she was ruder to Antony’s political ally Geminius, who visited Antony and Cleopatra in Greece hoping to convince Antony to return to Rome and shore up his political position:

> the friends of Antony went about in Rome beseeching the people in his behalf, and they sent one of their number, Geminius, with entreaties that Antony would not suffer himself to be voted out of his office and proclaimed an enemy of Rome. But Geminius, after his voyage to Greece, was an object of suspicion to Cleopatra, who thought that he was acting in the interests of Octavia; he was always put upon with jokes at supper and insulted with places of no honour at table, but he endured all this and waited for an opportunity to confer with Antony. Once, however, at a supper, being bidden to tell the reasons for his coming, he replied that the rest of his communication required a sober head, but one thing he knew, whether he was drunk or sober, and that was that all would be well if Cleopatra was sent off to Egypt. At this, Antony was wroth, and Cleopatra said: ‘Thou hast done well, Geminius, to confess the truth without being put to the torture.’ Geminius, accordingly, after a few days, ran away to Rome. And Cleopatra's flatterers drove away many of the other friends of Antony also who could not endure their drunken tricks and scurrilities. Among these were Marcus Silanus and Dellius the historian. And Dellius says that he was also afraid of a plot against him by Cleopatra, of which Glaucus the physician had told him. For he had offended Cleopatra at supper by saying that while sour wine was served to them, Sarmentus, at Rome, was drinking Falernian. Now, Sarmentus was one of the youthful favourites of Caesar, such as the Romans call ‘deliciae.’

Her taste for party tricks (some of them rather cruel) seems to be a genuine personal quirk which she shared with Antony: our main source for it, Plutarch, claims his authority for the anecdotes he cites was a friend of his grandfather’s who spent time with Antony and Cleopatra’s court as a young man.

Above all, though, Roman popular opinion disapproved quite strongly of Antony’s preference for Cleopatra over his wife Octavia. There was an element of politics there: Octavia was supposed to be the tangible symbol of peace between Octavian and Antony, so public sympathy might also have been part of a general fear of civil war. Nonetheless it seems like Octavia’s plight was genuinely distressing to the Romans: she was regarded as a kind of domestic martyr for her tireless devotion to Antony’s children (even those he fathered with Cleopatra) and her popularity long outlived the propagandistic atmosphere of the civil war. The poet Virgil, for example, was said to be particularly devoted to her.

So yes — even if you leave out the femme-fatale business, the Isis outfits, and general Roman aversion to both strong women and “exotic” powers Cleopatra was still pretty controversial.
