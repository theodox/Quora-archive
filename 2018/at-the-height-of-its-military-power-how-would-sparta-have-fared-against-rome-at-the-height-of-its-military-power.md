This would not have been a serious contest in any way. Sparta’s greatest extent fit neatly into one of the thirty-odd provinces of the Roman Empire.

__Raw numbers__ 

At Plataea, the climax of the Persian wars, the Spartans fielded an army of 40,000 — but of these only __5,000__  were the true Spartiates, the legendary warriors: the rest were lightly armed helots and half-trained _periokoi_ , Sparta’s resident aliens. Only a dire emergency had convinced the Spartans to arm them.

By the end of the first century the Roman empire fielded 30 legions — about 165,000 legionaries — accompanied by about 150,000 auxiliary infantry and 70,000 auxiliary cavalry: __about 400,000 in all__ . At the end of the second century that number may have 450,000, though quality was beginning to decline. The Roman army at it’s peak was almost three times larger than the entire population of classical Sparta (men, women, and children).

__Tactics__ 

But even without the mismatch in numbers Roman forces were much more capable.

Roman warfare evolved in a much more competitive environment. Italy has several distinct regions, each of which had its own military styles. Greek cities in the south fought like the enemies the Spartans knew best, but the Gauls of northern Italy fought very differently with their heavy mail and long swords. The Samnites of central Italy were hillmen, fighting mobile battles in regions where simple linear tactics didn’t work. The Roman also fought a wide variety of foreign enemies as well — from Hellenistic armies with elephants to the famous light cavalry of Africa to British tribesmen in chariots.

The Spartans, by contrast, had a much simpler set of problems to solve. They were well drilled and disciplined, but their opponents were almost always other Greeks, fighting in the same style as theirs but less professionally. When they ran into the unfamiliar, like the Theban general [Epaminondas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epaminondas), they [lost their reputation for invincibility in a hurry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leuctra).

__Artillery__ 

The classical Spartan army never had catapults. The first primitive versions were invented right around the end of the Peloponessian war, when Spartan power was at a climax. But when a Greek from Syracuse demonstrated one for Spartan king [Archidamus III ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archidamus_III)he remarked in dismay “alas, by Herakles! Man’s valour is dead!” Sparta eventually adopted catapults when its classical military system decayed — but by then it was a second-rate power and not a military leader.

Roman legions — from at least the 3rd century BC — had [dedicated artillery units](https://www.ancient.eu/article/649/roman-artillery/) with specialists to handle repair, maintenance and battlefield use. A Roman catapult could fire bolts or stone as far as 300 meters. Roman ships were also equipped with artillery, suitable for war at sea or for besieging port cities.

__Siege warfare__ 

The Spartans were famously scornful of the unmanly side of warfare. Digging ditches or toppling walls were jobs for helots, not true Spartan warriors. Unsurprisingly, the Spartans were not very good at siege warfare. It took them almost two years to capture tiny [Plataea](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/thucydides/siege-of-plataea/) from a mere 500 defenders.

Every Roman legion, on the other hand, included [professional engineers](https://www.ancient.eu/Roman_Siege_Warfare/) who could build field fortifications, bridge rivers, and construct siege works. Caesar, for example, built a 10-story siege tower (with supporting earthworks) at the siege of [Uxellodunum ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Uxellodunum)in 51 BC. The 375 ft high assault ramp the Romans built at [Masada](https://www.ancient.eu/image/3682/) is still there after 2000 years.

__Logistics__ 

Another aspect of the Spartan disdain for the mundane side of warfare was their attitude towards logistics. The Spartans trained themselves to live on hard rations, and delegated the business of moving food and supplies to their helots. The Romans, on the other hand, were well aware of the value of unsexy assets like roads and harbors. They were also well supplied on the march: during the conquest of Britain, the British tribesmen mocked the Romans for their soft living and lavish diet on the march:

> [The Romans] cannot bear up under hunger (and) thirst as we can . . . They require kneaded bread and wine and oil, and if any of these things fail them, they perish; for us, on the other hand, any grass or root serves as bread, the juice of any plant as oil, any water as wine

__TLDR__ 

The Spartans come from an earlier and less sophisticated era in warfare. Their entire society was geared towards fostering a warrior ethos of discipline and bravery. These are fine things, particularly in a tight spot, but not the totality of warfare. Even controlling for the huge mismatch in scale — the difference between an empire of 75 million people and a regional collection of city-states which might total a million or two — the Spartans never had to develop the range of capabilities which are necessary to conquests on a continental scale. They were brave and hardy, but tactically inflexible and strategically limited.
