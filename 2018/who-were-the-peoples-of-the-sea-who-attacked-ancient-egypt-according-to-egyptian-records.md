The short answer is “[we’re not sure](https://www.quora.com/Where-did-the-Sea-Peoples-the-people-who-invaded-Greece-Egypt-and-the-Hittite-Empire-in-the-Late-Bronze-Age-come-from).” We can tell that the group was large and diverse — it includes one known nationality, a couple who are probably familiar, and several who can only be guessed at.

The main Egyptian source for the Sea People invasion is the victory inscription at [Medinet Habu](https://emp.byui.edu/SATTERFIELDB/Rel302/Medinet%20Habu%20and%20the%20Sea%20Peoples.htm), where Pharoah Ramses III recorded his [triumph over the invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Delta). In classic Egyptian style the inscriptions are long on self-congratulation and bombast, but short on the kind of detail we’d need to identify the various Sea People contingents. At least the inscription is accompanied by illustrations which give us more to go on; Egyptian writers were often very sketchy in their discussions of faraway lands and peoples but their artists were keen on identifiable exotic details. [This site](http://www.salimbeti.com/micenei/sea.htm) has some more detail on the names and pictures.

_Prisoners being led away from the battle of the Nile Delta . The leftmost is a R’bw, the rightmost a Peleset. The second may be a Shekelesh, the third and fourth are not obvious but may be generic “Asiatics” from Syria or Canaan._ 

Only one group is unambiguously known, the __R'bw__  or Libyans — the ancestors of today’s Berber/Amazigh peoples. They lived to the west of Egypt, which somewhat confuses the traditional version of the Sea People’s scything clockwise around the eastern Mediterranean but here, at least, we can be sure of who we are dealing with.

_Peleset prisoners are identified by their distinctive headdress_ 

The known ones we’re at least somewhat confident of are the __Lukka__ and the __Peleset.__ Most — though not all — modern scholars identify these with the historic [Lycians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lukka_lands)and [Philistines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philistines), respectively. There’s also a lot of students who think the Egyptian name __[Sherden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherden)__  corresponds to [Sardinians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuragic_civilization) — but on the other hand a smaller contingent suspects it could be connected to the people of [Sardis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardis) in western Asia Minor.

_Sherden warriors; their equipment looks very similar to art from contemporary Sardinia._ 

Then there are several more names whose identities are basically guesswork — trying to map the Egyptian sound values onto familiar names from around the Mediterranean. These guesses may be correct or not — until something new turns up in the Egyptian records we’ll have to be content with labeling them as guesses.

Among the guesswork identities you usually encounter are two different groups who might be the ancestors of the Mycenaean Greeks; the __Ekwesh__  (though to be Homer’s “Achaeans” ) and the __Denyen__ or __Danuna__  (perhaps Homer’s “Danaans”, another synonym for Greeks). There’s some contradictory evidence that suggests that the Peleset, who probably are the Philistines, shared some kind of cultural background with Mycenaeans — there are similarities in armor, weapon and pottery and maybe (just maybe) language. So, it’s conceivable that the cousins of Agamemnon and Achilles were Sea People… but it’s equally conceivable that we’re just grasping at a chance resemblance in sounds.

Similarly the __Shekelesh__ might be the [Sicels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicels) of Sicily - though the Sicels are not otherwise known for piracy or large-scale overseas activity in historic times. They may however have also spoken an Indo-European language so possibly they, the proto-Greek Ekwesh/Denyen, and the Peleset were all subsets of an Indo-European contingent in the Sea People migration. Or, again, it may just be a coincidence of sounds.

Finally there are the __Tjekker__  and the __Teresh.__ Playing the name-game again the Teresh might be connected with [Tyrrhenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrhenians), an ethnic group from northwest Asia minor. The Tjekker have never been identified although they later turn up settled in [Tel Dor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Dor) in Canaan
