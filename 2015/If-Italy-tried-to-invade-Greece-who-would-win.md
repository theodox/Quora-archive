They tried it not that long ago -- you don't need to go back to the Venetians or the Romans, Mussolini invaded Greece in 1940. It was [humiliating debacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Italian_War) for the Italians: not only did their much larger, more modern Italian force fail to crush the Greeks -- the Greek counterattack pushed the Italians far back into Albania. The Greek defiance of Mussolini's ultimatum is still celebrated in Greece every October 28th as Επέτειος του «'Οχι», the "Anniversary of the No".

_Greek mule train in Albania, late 1940. Italy's supply of tanks and trucks turned out not to be much help in the mountains._ 

Beside Greek gallantry there's a lot of truth to [Fabio D'Aleo's ](https://www.quora.com/profile/Fabio-DAleo)answer - the Italian troops had no particular desire to be there and generally didn't exert themselves more than was necessary.

Unfortunately for the Greeks, their success eventually convinced Hitler to get involved directly in the conflict, leading in short order to the fall of Greece in mid 1941. However it's usually believed that this unplanned adventure threw off the timetable of Operation Barbarossa and possibly prevented the capture of Moscow by pushing the Nazi invasion of Russia further into the winter.
