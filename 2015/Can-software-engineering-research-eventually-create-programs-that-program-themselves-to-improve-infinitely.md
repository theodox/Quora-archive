Most programs don't require sentience or anything like it to improve. You could perfect a program for, say, analyzing traffic flow in cities so that eventually predicted rush hour traffic volumes to within a few fractions do a percentage point. But sentience would not be needed- just more efficient pattern recognition, statistical analysis, and data management. It would take a smart person do all those things, but a very dumb yet highly optimized computer program can do them with no thought at all (and, in many cases, with no deep understanding of the subject matter - all the program does is change numbers, watch the outputs, and try again until the desired results happen.

To make an analogy, you can improve your aircraft designs forever without creating a bird.
