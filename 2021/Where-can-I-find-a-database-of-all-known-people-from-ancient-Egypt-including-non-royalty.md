There is not one which spans all of Egyptian history.

The biggest collection I’m aware of is at [Trismegistos.org](https://www.trismegistos.org/ref/), their database covers 373,444 people as of this writing (collected from just over half a million documents) . Its easily searchable. However it’s skewed late (800 BC to 800 AD) and it’s pretty bare bones; you won’t get a lot of deep biographical detail, mostly just names and what sources they show up in.

There’s a database of hieroglyphic names [here (in French)](https://www.ifao.egnet.net/bases/agea/noms/) but it’s only a cross -reference of names and their origins.

[Another French project](https://capea.hypotheses.org/) seems to have stopped updating in 2015 — it’s not clear if the project is simply grinding through the material to be catalogued or if the team has moved on to other things.

_This looks like what you’d want — but as far as I can find out it’s not accessible over the internet. If somebody figures out how to access this publicly add in the comments!_ 

If it’s any consolation, [here’s a whole page of articles dealing with the technical difficulties of creating an Egyptian personal name database](https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Egypt_Prosopography).
