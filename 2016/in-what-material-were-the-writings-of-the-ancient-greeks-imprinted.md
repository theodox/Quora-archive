The most common writing material was actually potsherds or _ostraka._ These were very common and suitable for lots of short notes and record-keeping - you could write on them with a sharp stone or a paint brush, and every Greek city had a lot of broken pottery to spare. Our word 'ostracism' comes from _ostraka_  and reflects the Athenian habit of writing down the names of unpopular politicians who could be voted into temporary exile. A pot piece is what you'd use for a shopping list, to record an informal contract, or to send a note home.

 For more complex writing the best material was [papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus). It came mostly from Egypt but originally the Greeks got it from trade via the Phoenicians ("Bible" comes from _biblia,_ which comes from the Phoenician city of [Byblos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byblos)). One of our best sources of information about Greek daily life is a giant garbage dump from the Egyptian desert which contains thousands of scraps of papyrus from the Greek and Roman periods in Egypt:

Animal skins provided a high quality but expensive alternative. The technique was perfected in the city of [Pergamon,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pergamon) which is the ultimate origin of our word [parchment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchment). Parchment was durable, but required more labor to create than papyrus; it tended to be reserved for high-value documents. 

Long writngs were almost always stored as scrolls -- if you look at most ancient texts you see see they are divided up into many 'books' (where we might say 'chapters') -- each 'book' corresponded to a scroll; the Iliad, for example, has 24 'books'. Modern books - technically '[codices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex)', bound flat between covers of wood, leather and so on -- became popular in the Roman period and replaced scrolls for most purposes by around the 4th century.

For permanent storage, carved stone engraving was common but very expensive. This was reserved for the same kinds of things we use it for today: memorials, monuments, and critical proclamations.

Romans used all of the same techniques, but they favored erasable wax tablets for everyday writing, which would be scratched with a wooden or metal stylus. Romans also engraved or embossed historical documents (treaties, Senatorial decrees, etc) on metal sheets.
