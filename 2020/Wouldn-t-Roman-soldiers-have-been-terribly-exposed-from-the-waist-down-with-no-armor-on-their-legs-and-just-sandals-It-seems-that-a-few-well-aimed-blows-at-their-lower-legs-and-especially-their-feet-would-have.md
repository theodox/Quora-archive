# Wouldn’t Roman soldiers have been terribly exposed from the waist down with no armor on their legs and just sandals? It seems that a few well aimed blows at their lower legs and especially their feet would have rendered a Roman soldier immobile.

The Roman style involved a reasonable set of tradeoffs to accommodate a different style of warfare.

Greek hoplites used a circular shield which only covered them down to the knee : that’s one of the reasons Greek armor usually came with a set of bronze greaves:

Greek hoplites typically fought in very close order: each fighter was expected to help cover his neighbor using that big round shield — one of the reasons the right wing was the place of honor in the battle line was the fact that the rightmost soldiers were exposed on their right side, so their place was more dangerous. So, Greek phalanxes typically fought just under a 1 meter spacing, so there was not a lot of room for footwork. Leg protection made a lot of sense in those tightly packed formations (many Greeks only wore a single greave on their left leg, the side that would face the enemy when presenting the shield).

The [earliest Roman armies were visually indistinguishable from Greeks of the same period](https://www.quora.com/What-did-Roman-soldiers-look-like-when-it-was-still-a-kingdom/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=c6566b00&srid=zLvM) , and they also used circular shields and greaves. But after the Samnite Wars (starting in the mid-300’s BC) they adopted a more open and flexible style of fighting which had prioritized medium over heavy infantry, with less emphasis on solid formations. So, the classical Roman legion was more diffused (how much so is debated, but Polybius, at least says that there were typically two Greek phalangites opposite each Roman in the opposing front line). This allowed a Roman soldier more freedom of movement than his Greek counterpart: he could dodge a blow more easily without upsetting his neighbors.

To make this work, a Roman legionary typically used a taller shield — first elliptical shields and later the famous half-cylindrical “scutum” both of which extended below the knee:

A pair of bronze greaves weighs about 2.6 kg or almost six pounds (for comparison, that’s about three times what a pair of heavy hiking boots weighs). For a more mobile Roman, who had the freedom to avoid a possible blow by movement, the tradeoff of greater mobility and less weight was a reasonable one, trading a little protection for more endurance and flexiblity.

All that said, some Romans _did_ use greaves. This tended to be more common among centurions or officers, who had the money to supplement their own equipment (as shown in the illustration above). This was probably a mix of personal choice and a conservative traditional aesthetic among gentleman-soldiers in the upper ranks.
