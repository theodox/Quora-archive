Ephialtes was killed — but, in classical Greek fashion, it was part of a private vendetta and not because of his role as a traitor.

It’s interesting to note that there was an organized effort to find him, and the Spartans rewarded his assassin even though they knew the killing had nothing to do with patriotism. Here’s Herodotus ([7.213](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/historians/herod/herodotus11.html))

> This Ephialtes afterwards, from fear of the Lacedaemonians, fled into Thessaly; and during his exile, in an assembly of the Amphictyons held at Pylae, a price was set upon his head by the Pylagorae. When some time had gone by, he returned from exile, and went to Anticyra, where he was slain by Athenades, a native of Trachis. Athenades did not slay him for his treachery, but for another reason, which I shall mention in a later part of my history: yet still the Lacedaemonians honoured him none the less. Thus then did Ephialtes perish a long time afterwards.

Herodotus never does get around to telling what Athenades’ motives really were. What’s interesting, but also extremely characteristic of life in a face-to-face society with poor communications and an active rumor mill, is that there were actually a couple of alternative suspects: Not unlike the Kennedy assassination, the trauma of the Persian War attracted multiple variants. Herodotus again:

> There is another story told, which I do not at all believe – to wit, that Onetas the son of Phanagoras, a native of Carystus, and Corydallus, a man of Anticyra, were the persons who spoke on this matter to the king, and took the Persians across the mountain. One may guess which story is true, from the fact that the deputies of the Greeks, the Pylagorae, who must have had the best means of ascertaining the truth, did not offer the reward for the heads of Onetas and Corydallus, but for that of Ephialtes of Trachis; and again from the flight of Ephialtes, which we know to have been on this account. Onetas, I allow, although he was not a Malian, might have been acquainted with the path, if he had lived much in that part of the country; but as Ephialtes was the person who actually led the Persians round the mountain by the pathway, I leave his name on record as that of the man who did the deed.
