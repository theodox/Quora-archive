Only in emergencies. The trireme was the 5th century equivalent of a fighter plane — it was optimize for speed and lethality and not much else. The large number of rowers needed to power a trireme (or, for that matter, any fast galley) made them very expensive to operate. They were also built like racing shells, long and slender, so they had little room for extra cargo.

Cargo ships were also, technically, galleys — but they depended more on sailpower than on big crews of rowers. This let them carry more cargo and fewer rowers, saving money and maximizing profits. Oars were still important, however — both because of the vagaries of the weather, but also because the Mediterranean was infested with pirates and nobody wanted to be caught out by a pirate galley on a windless day.

In the Hellenistic and Roman periods civilian ships got fairly large — by the first century [big grain freighters could be 1,000 tons or so.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis_(ship)) These ships had much larger cargo capacity and crews. Under the Roman empire piracy was less of a concern so merchant ships were even more dependent on wind power.
