If you mean “Roman emperors who were not of ethnic Roman origin” then yes, there were quite a few. Trajan (r. 98–117) was born in Spain, though his family had lived there only a couple of generations. Hadrian (r 117–138) was also born in Spain, of mixed Italian and Hispanian heritage. The [Severan dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severan_dynasty) (193–245) were an interesting mix of North African origins and the local nobility of Syria. After the Severans the [majority of subsequent emperors were not Italians](https://www.quora.com/Were-most-Emperors-of-the-Roman-Empire-born-in-what-is-now-Italy), with the largest contingent coming from the Balkans.

The [Roman succession was messy](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=93b61b5e&srid=zLvM), but it was not particularly ethnocentric.
