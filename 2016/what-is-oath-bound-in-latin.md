That phrase sounds so Anglo-germanic that it doesn’t have an obvious translation to me.

The English “bound” is probably best rendered as _[ligatus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ligatus&la=la#lexicon)_ _,_  and it can mean something like ‘bound by an agreement’ or _pacta ligatus._ But is usually has the more physical sense of “tied up”.

_[Fides,](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?la=la&l=fides#lexicon)_ __ which we usually translate as ‘faith’ , also has a strong connotation of ‘pledged word’: to give your word to somebody was _obligare fidem alicui._ Fides as a very important aspect of the Roman concept of honor.

If you’re going for a classical ring, I think I’d try _fidem datam_  if it were a clause, as in “having sworn….” and _fidem datus_  (_data_ for a woman) if it were a description of a person. For a Roman “having given faith” was as serious as swearing an oath.

If you want a bit more of the Nordic tang, you could also try _fide ligatus/-a, “bound by faith”_ which is medieval Latin phrase but not classical AFAIK. It’s used for feudal relations.
