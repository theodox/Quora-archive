# What is the correct Latin translation of the English sentence "the road less traveled"? I know it is associated with the poem, and is easily mistranslated in a different context due to the English-specific ring it has to it (a unique life course).

You’re right, it’s tricky to find an exact match for the English phrase. A few of options:

_iter devium,_ a journey by ___back roads___ 

_infrequentatum iter,_ emphasizing the journey made ___less often___ 

_via inusitata_ , emphasing a road that’s ___rare or unusual___
