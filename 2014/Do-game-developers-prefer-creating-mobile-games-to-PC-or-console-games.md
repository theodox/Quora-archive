It depends a great deal on what individuals want.

Mobile games take less time to make and involve smaller teams. They offer the sense of completing something and of making a big individual contribution, both of which are much less when a project involves hundreds of people and lasts 3-4 years. For older devs who learned their skills on PS2-era hardware, mobile also offers an opportunity to keep using tricks (like poly optimization or forward rendering cheats) that aren't as important today as they were a decade ago.

Console games are less personal: they tend to be more bureaucratic and less adventurous than smaller titles because individual contributions matter less. On the other hand, there are many specialized skills which are too rare or expensive to use on mobile titles: advanced animation, cutting edge graphics, and hardcore AI are all much harder to do on mobile, so if those things are what drive you consoles are more appealing. 

It's also true that a big console game has a different impact on the culture: it's much more likely that you'll see a huge promotion, a big TV campaign, or a bunch of toys on the shelf for a mobile game (unless it's Angry Birds or Clash of Clans :)) Some developers like being part of a really big-time media showcase.

Many developers like to make the games they like to play -- which is of course very individual. If your taste runs towards FPS or RTS games, mobile is a tough space to satisfy; on the other hand if you don't like story-and-cinematic heavy games and prefer clever mechanics or nontraditional art styles, mobile is a better bet.

Last of all, there's the money. Console jobs tend to be more stable and pay better. However there are fewer than there used to be. Mobile jobs have been growing like crazy, but since mobile titles usually have short cycles and high turnover the mobile business can be much more chaotic if you have a family and a mortgage.
