That was definitely the opinion of ancient critics of the idea. Our word _[demagogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue)_ -- that is, an irresponsible "rabble rousing" populist politician -- is lifted directly from Athenian debates about the nature of democracy.

 The case for the prosecution looks more or less like this:

__"Democracy is irrational"__  

The people (the _demos_ ) are too easily swayed by a clever speaker with a slick program, even when the policies on offer are unworkable. The gullible voters will endorse all sorts of bad ideas -- like the [Sicilian Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Expedition) which destroyed the flower of the Athenian military, or voting for expensive programs that can only be financed by squeezing the empire dry. They'll also vacillate as moods shift and different speakers sway their emotions -- leading to things like the [Mytilenian Debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mytilenian_Debate) in which the Assembly voted first to annihilate the entire population of a captured city and then, moved the next day by remorse, rescinded the order just barely in time. 

 One of the saddest cases of popular unreason did lead directly to the eclipse of the democracy.

 In 406 BC, the Athenians won a great naval victory against long odds at the [battle of Arginusae. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Arginusae)However bad weather right after the battle scuppered efforts to rescue to survivors of dozens of damaged Athenian ships. The leaders of the victorious fleet were tried by the assembly for abandoning their fellow-citizens. Socrates, who was the presiding officer on the day of the trial, bravely refused to proffer what he saw as an illegal indictment. Nonetheless the assembly condemned six of the eight commanders -- including [Pericles the Younger, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles_the_Younger)the son of the more famous [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles) who had more success than any other Athenian politician in keeping the Assembly from rash decisions. Predictably the city quickly regretted its harsh actions and the accusers fled the city; one eventually returned but died as shunned outcast. Not only was this a monstrous injustice: within a year the mighty Athenian navy was destroyed by incompetent leadership at [Aegospotami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aegospotami) and the city fell to Spartans and their anti-democratic puppets, the [Thirty Tyrants.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Tyrants)

__"Democracy is corruptible"__ . 

One of the main ancient complaints about democracy was that it was too easy to sway voters with money. [Bribery ](http://www.jstor.org/stable/826870?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) in various forms was far from unknown (even a conservative aristocrat like [Cimon ](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Cimon)made a point of letting anybody who wanted to pluck fruits from his gardens -- a very popular gesture in a country like Greece which was noticed-blessed with food). 

More than bribery by individual politicians though , anti-democrats disliked institutions like pay for jury duty and above all the large Athenian navy which put tax money in the hands of poorer voters -- who of course then voted for more money that they could share. They regarded the democratic state as an extortion scheme, which collected money from the 'better' classes and funneled it to the _hoi polloi,_ the "many" Institutions that were supposed to protect the city and dispense justice were, they said, perverted into what we would call payola. 

Anti-democrats were particularly appalled at democratic justice. As the case of Arginusae -- or that of Socrates -- demonstrated, Athens had little formal protection for the rights of the accused: emotional appeals and popular moods were all that mattered. As Aristophanes put it in [The Wasps:](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristophanes/wasps.html) 

> ...there exists no king whose might is greater than ours. Is there a pleasure, a blessing comparable with that of a juryman? Is there a being who lives more in the midst of delights, who is more feared, aged though he be? From the moment I leave my bed, men of power, the most illustrious in the city, await me at the bar of the tribunal; the moment I am seen from the greatest distance, they come forward to offer me a gentle hand...."Oh, father," they say, "pity me, I adjure you by the profit you were able to make in the public service or in the army, when dealing with the victuals." Why,the man who speaks thus would not know of my existence, had I not let him off on some former occasion.

The 'profits' arising from the jury service eventually led the Athenians to force all important law suits in their empire into Athenian courts.

Which brings up the final accusation:

__"Democracy is imperialism"__ 

That democracy was regarded as an imperialistic, aggressive ideology comes as a surprise to many moderns, raised on the mantra that democracies don't attack each other. However Athenian democracy was nakedly and even defiantly imperialistic. 

The lower classes liked expansionist policies which expanded the navy and its related, labor intensive industries. They also benefitted from Athenian colonies set up in key strategic or economic zones. The aristocrats. by contrast, tended to be less expansionist -- as big landowners it was their property that suffered when enemy armies ravaged Attica. Even so, the aristocratic self image harked back to the warrior nobility of the Iliad, and no aristocrat wanted to be perceived as too dovish. It took less than a generation for Athen's idealistic leadership of the Greek united front against the Persians -- the alliance known as the [Delian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_League) -- to transform into a thinly-veiled protection racket. The glories of the Parthenon were, quite literally, built with money that was extorted from Athenian 'allies' at spear-point.

_The Athenians proudly set up the lists of tribute they demanded from their subject 'allies' for everyone to see._ 

The net result was that Athens bullied and plundered a lot of the Greek world, making itself very unpopular and earning the nickname _polis tyrannos_ , the tyrant city. In the great war with Sparta, Athens had few faithful friends and many resentful subjects who were only too happy to exchange masters. This eroded Athen's considerable strategic advantages and contributed very materially to the loss of the war.

__Summation__ 

Of course, there are counter-arguments to all of these points. 

While the assembly clearly did make foolish decisions and it vacillated terribly, the same was said of Sparta's aristocratic ephors. The aristocrat's 'popular bribery' was in part what we would call a social safety net. And Athen's empire ultimately arose because the Athenian democracy had risen to the challenge of the Persian invasion when many more aristocratic and 'respectable' Greek states (notably oligarchic Thebes, Athens' traditional enemy to the north) had surrendered to the invaders. 

The really damning charge against Athenian democracy is, however, that it was fundamentally _immature_ . It lacked the legal framework that it needed to dampen the passions of the city when they ran amok.

The Athenians made many laws and institutions to protect and preserve their democratic institutions in a world where democracy was a radical experiment. The one danger they failed to guard against, though, was __themselves__ : time and again the city undermined itself with hasty, impulsive and unjust decisions that were quickly regretted but could not be undone. There were no institutional safeguards to prevent the democratic majority from exercising the same kinds of arbitrary powers that Athenians affected to abhor in tyrants and oligarchs. There were no 'rights' and no 'constitution' to appeal to when the tensions of a particular day ran too high -- and as a result they committed terrible injustices and rash decisions. They failed to realize that they were just as dangerous to themselves as their enemies could be. When strong politicians, like Pericles or Themistocles (or in later years [Demosthenes) ](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Demosthenes-Greek-statesman-and-orator)were able to restrain the worst tendencies of the crowd the Athenian democracy achieved great things -- but in the absence of legal checks and rights Athens remains 'a government of men, not of laws.'

For a really good look at what ancient anti-democrats thought, the anonymous author known as the [Old Oligarch ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0158)provides a laundry list of all the complaints ever lodged against popular government.
