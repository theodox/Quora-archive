Slave-rulers are actually more common than you might think.

It’s an old, old tradition. [Sargon of Akkad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad) — the Akkadian emperor, not the blogger — was first a gardener and then a cup-bearer in the palace of [Ur-Zababa of Kish,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur-Zababa) around 4,300 years ago, but he became the greatest conqueror and ruler of his era. His [story is heavily mythologized](http://www.stmuhistorymedia.org/our-worlds-first-emperor/), but it’s a very early example of the rags (or fetters) to riches tale, and one that Sargon himself was at pains to spread. It’s probably telling that his name is really a title, meaning “legitimate king,” — something you don’t usually have to remind people of quite so much. Still, Assyrian emperors still used his name more than a thousand years later; he was one of history’s epoch-making kings.

There may be some subtlety to the story we don’t know. [Lugal-zage-si ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugal-zage-si)— the king who the young Sargon served as an apprentice gardener and butler — also described himself like as “a slave raised by [the goddess] Ningirim.” It’s not clear how we should read that — it’s possible that the Sargon story is a garbled version of some conventional way of talking about rulership that we don’t understand — but on the balance (especially given Sargon’s protests-too-much royal name) I incline to think this really is a case of a palace coup by a well-placed slave.



The ambiguity there — that you can be a slave and yet infinitely closer to the real levers of power than a “free” person outside the palace walls - is perfectly illustrated in a whole series of states ruled by members of the military slave caste in the Islamic world. In English these are generically known as [Mamluks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk) or [Ghilman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghilman), and there are examples from Egypt, Persia, Central Asia, India and Mesopotamia.

_[Qutuz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutuz)_ _(left) and_ _[Baibars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baibars)_ _(right) are both Mamluk Sultans of Egypt who were slaves in their youths_ 

It’s worth pointing out that these are not always stories of personal pluck overcoming adversity — in English we don’t have a good way to describe the actual state of a military slave in these societies, but it was not exactly what we think of when we hear the word “slave.” A mamluk or a ghulam was not free, in the sense of being able to pursue their own aims and vocations in life. However they were, like young Sargon, much closer to the center of power than many free people in the same times and places — a unique combination of unfreedom and privilege.

If [Dimitris Almyrantis](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dimitris-Almyrantis) chimes in I expect he’ll have a more detailed and nuanced explanation.
