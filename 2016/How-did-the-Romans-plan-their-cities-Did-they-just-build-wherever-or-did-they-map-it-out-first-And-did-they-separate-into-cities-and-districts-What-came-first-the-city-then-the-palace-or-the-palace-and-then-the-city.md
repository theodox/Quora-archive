# How did the Romans plan their cities?Did they just build wherever, or did they map it out first? And did they separate into cities and districts? What came first: the city then the palace, or the palace and then the city?

Roman cities generally came in two very distinct flavors.

The majority of them were actually not 'Roman', but rather represented the imposition of Roman institutions onto pre-existing communities -- usually, those laid out in the relatively haphazard way of most ancient cities. You constantly run into very misleading inscriptions stating that so and so 'founded' a city when much of the time the 'foundation' was really just the granting of certain legal privileges or the granting of a particular status. That's why you see some 'Roman' cities that look like this (a reconstruction of Roman Athens):

However when they had the chance the Romans preferred a much more regular, rational layout and plan. They inherited the Greek tradition of city planning on rectangular grids (known as the [Hippodamian grid)](http://www.museumofthecity.org/project/hippodamus-and-early-planned-cities/) but they refined it to include more open space and central public focus: the forum*, a kind of city center where the most important civic buildings, temples and monuments would be located.

The classic Roman city plan is actually based on the route-march camps which Roman armies erected every night on campaign: it's a square layout bisected by two main avenues, the [Cardo Maximus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardo) running roughly North-South and the [Decumanus Maximus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decumanus_Maximus) running East-West. The civic forum would sit at or near where these two main roads intersect. In the original military setting that was where the commander's tent and staff were placed.

Just to illustrate how closely the civic form followed the military, here's a Roman fort (or _castra_ ) on Hadrian's wall in Britain:

showing the two main axes (note where gates are on the walls) and the headquarters in the middle. Here's the Roman center of Florence:

which is easy to pick out from the medieval and later accretions outside the central grid and shows the same basic layout of crossed streets and central square.

In the Republican period new cities tended to be built for defense: most new Roman cities before the first century AD were _colonia_ , "colonies" of Roman citizens -- usually military veterans -- planted in newly acquired territory and expected to keep an eye on Roman interests in their new neighborhood. That made the familiar camp layout a natural choice. In the empire -- at least during the relatively safe days of the first, second and early third centuries -- defense was not a prime consideration and new settlements were often built without walls in older provinces.

Of course the oldest military maxim is "no plan survives contact with the enemy." Over time the regular street grids tended to be altered to accommodate new needs and growing populations. The needs of industry or luxury could alter the original design, and of course the Romans were not immune to the laws of gravity or geology so they had to adapt to hills, river-courses and so on. However the basics were still pretty similar from Scotland to Syria: Here's the frontier fortress city of Dura Europos on the Euphrates, showing the same grid plan (the _Decumanus_  is marked with the largest red arrow)

In terms of layout, the usual process would be to survey the area, lay out the main streets, and establish a wooden palisade wall. The workers and overseers would live in tents (again, laid out like a military camp) until the key thoroughfares and perimeter was established and then construction in masonry would start. Big civic buildings (like temples or a [basilica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica)) would come later -- it was pretty common for those to be provided by a wealthy politician (or sometimes as a gift of the emperor) sort of like a college donation bearing the name of a wealthy donor today. Most cities did not start with aqueducts -- well water was the standard for most people.

For a really good general reader's view of Roman city planning from the ground up, David Macaulay's [City: A Story of Roman Planning and Construction](http://amzn.to/1o3l9Jh) can't be beat.

_Another example of the grid standard in a far-off corner of the Empire:_ _[Timgad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timgad)_ _in Algeria._ 



*strictly speaking, any open plaza -- particularly a market -- is a _forum_  in Latin; usually, when you say "the forum" you mean the civic forum where the key civic and religious buildings sat; other _fora_ might include a _[forum boarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_Boarium)_ _,_ or cattle-market; a _[forum holitorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_Holitorium)_ __ or vegetable market, a _[forum piscarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_Piscarium)_ __ or fish-market and so on. Unlike the main civic forum these -- on account of noise and smell -- were _not_  prized addresses.
