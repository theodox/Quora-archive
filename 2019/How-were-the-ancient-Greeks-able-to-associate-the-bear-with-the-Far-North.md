We’re not really sure of the origin of the myth.

The story goes that the two constellations we call _Ursa Major_ and _Ursa Minor_  — the big bear and the little bear, in Latin — are really the nymph [Callisto](https://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Kallisto.html) and her son, by Zeus, named Arcas. Zeus’s wife Hera, who generally hated all of Zeus’s girlfriends, transformed Callisto into a bear to punish her. Arcas grew up to be the eponymous king of Arcadia (the central part of the Peloponessus, which the Greeks regarded as the most mystical and ‘ancient’ part of their world). Arcas was a famous hunter, and as a grown man he encountered his mother on a hunt — just as he was about to slay her, Zeus intervened and turned them both into constellations to save him from the guilt of matricide.

As with most myths, there are multiple competing versions and much room for interpretation. There are a lot of traditions that associate Arcadia with the pre-Hellenic past, so it’s possible the myth is a garbled memory of a much older story. There are[ several cultures both in and out of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major#Mythology) who identify the two polar constellations as bears, so it’s just possible this is a dim reflection of a tradition going way back to the hunter cultures of the last Ice Age. On the other hand the story of Callisto and Arcas is not written down until quite late, actually during the Roman period. So, it’s also possible that it’s a late effort to explain the names of constellations whose real origins were lost to time — in Homer, several hundred years before, the constellations were referred to as “the wagons”, so clearly the bear story is not the only one.
