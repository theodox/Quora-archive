Indie success is pretty hard to come by: the average indie developer made $11,000 in 2014: [ Gamasutra salary survey](http://www.gamasutra.com/salarysurvey2014.pdf). And that's an average that includes the occasional mega-hit. 

While I think [Ernest W. Adams](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ernest-W-Adams) has it generally right, I would say that one unbeatable advantage of being an indie is that it's self-selection: if you can handle the economic risk for a year or two you have a chance to learnt the business and most importantly to finish a title: hunting for a conventional games job is far easier if you've completed a commercial project (even one that's not an earth-shattering success). Taking two years off, living in your parents basement, and getting your own project out via steam or the app store may be more cost effective than spending a lot of money on a vocational school games program and then joining the industry on the bottom rung. 

This route is nor for everybody -- it demands a ton of discipline and good learn-as-you-go skills to finish a project on your own -- but if you do complete an indie project you will:
 

have a good, practical idea of what development is really like (and whether it's as fun for you as you expected)

have demonstrated a lot of the things employers need: ship skills are precious and they don't get taught in school

not absorbed a ton of student debt.

Going indie is like trying to score big as a blogger or a musician : it's definitely not for everyone. For a small, highly motivated minority it's very satisfying. For a lot of others (I was one) it's a good training ground for a less-risky conventional career that does not depend on sweet-talking an HR department or taking out a lot of loans.
