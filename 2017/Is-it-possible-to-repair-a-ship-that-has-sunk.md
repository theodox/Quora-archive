Absolutely possible, not even that uncommon. For examples youâ€™ve got that classic of Canadian maritime music, _Mary Ellen Carter_ :



And my personal favorite example: of the 8 US battleships sunk at Pearl Harbor, six were refloated to fight again during the war:

_USS West Virginia_ sank at Pearl Harbor, but would fight again across the Pacific

_Nevada_  also returned to bombard the beaches of Normandy
