The best English translation is probably the “[Golden mean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy))”— being in the Goldilocks zone between too much and too little of something. It’s the spot between cowardice and foolhardiness, between naivety and cynicism, between gluttony and starvation… it’s the essence of ancient philosophy’s idealization of moderation over extremes.

As an aside, “mediocrity” and “mean” are both false friends here. The Latin _mediocritas_  is more or less “middle-ness”, the quality of being neither too much nor too little. The negative connotation of _mediocrity_ in English is not part of the original Latin. As for “mean” it’s the arithmetic version — that is, what we usually call the _average_ .
