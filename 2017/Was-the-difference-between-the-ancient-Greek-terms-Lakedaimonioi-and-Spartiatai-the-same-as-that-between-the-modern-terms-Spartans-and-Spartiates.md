# Was the difference between the ancient Greek terms "Lakedaimonioi" and "Spartiatai" the same as that between the modern terms "Spartans" and "Spartiates"?

Sort of. Strictly, Λακεδαιμόνιοι would just be “people from Laconia,” where Σπαρτιάται would be refer only to full Spartan citizens, the Ὅμοιοι who formed the military elite of Spartan society.

For example in Xenophon’s account of the [Conspiracy of Cinadon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_of_Cinadon), the anti-Spartan revolutionaries count up their class enemies:

> Cinadon had taken him to the edge of the market-place and directed him to count how many Spartiatae there were in the market-place. “And I,” he said, “after counting king and ephors and senators and about forty others, asked `Why, Cinadon, did you bid me count these men?' And he replied: `Believe,' said he, `that these men are your enemies, and that all the others who are in the market-place, more than four thousand in number, are your allies.'”

but when the ephors are trying to stamp out the conspiracy:

> they decided to send Cinadon to Aulon along with others of the younger men, and to order him to bring back with2 him certain of the Aulonians and Helots whose names were written in the official dispatch. And they ordered him to bring also the woman who was said to be the most beautiful woman in Aulon and was thought to be corrupting the Lacedaemonians who came there, older and younger alike.

That is to say the revolutionary conspiracy included the “Lacedemonians” but not the “Spartiates”.

That said — in practice people used the two terms as synonyms most of the time, so you can’t read to much into the choice of one word over the other except by context.
