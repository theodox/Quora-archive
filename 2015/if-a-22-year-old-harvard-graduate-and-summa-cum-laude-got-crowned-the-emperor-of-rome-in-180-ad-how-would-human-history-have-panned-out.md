# If a 22-year-old Harvard graduate and summa cum laude got crowned the emperor of Rome in 180 AD, how would human history have panned out?

OK, this is not a serious answer. I'm also sure it is unjust to the oppressed Harvard grads of the world. You got me. 

The qualities you need to succeed in the American higher education system do not correlate very well with those you need to become the sole ruler of an empire -- particularly not an empire which is about to descend into a century of chaos, betrayal and civil war. 

 Your academic success correlates with native intelligence and the ability to work hard -- those are both valuable traits. However very high academic success correlates pretty strongly with willingness to please; a good eye for the tastes, manners and a social styles of your evaluators; and a certain willingness to channel your energy into socially acceptable outlets. You've had to do those things since you could walk if you want to end up in the front ranks of the academic cohort.

These qualities -- admirable as they may be -- are not ones which tend to serve you well when fending off [ambitious generals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximinus_Thrax) with armies, [Praetorian guards](http://jaysromanhistory.com/romeweb/empcont/e084.htm) with big long knives, and imperial relatives with a side line in [poisoned mushrooms](http://www.historyswomen.com/moregreatwomen/Locusta.html) or [collapsing boats](https://sites.google.com/site/nerotheromanemperor/murder-attempts-by-nero-against-agrappina).

_No 22 year old could take on_ _[Sejanus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejanus)_ _. Or Patrick Stewart with a full head of hair._ 
 
Sure, over-achieving undergrads have been known to steal each other's lab notes and dose each other's punch: but on the whole, they are very well behaved people. 

In fact, they analogize very nicely to the cultured, well-educated, and ineffectual Roman aristocracy: a class whose elegance, liberality, rhetorical skills and classical educations availed them not a whit during the century and a half of crisis which began with the death of Marcus Aurelius. By the time the dust settled at the end of the third century they would be basically extinct. I'm reasonably sure that a 22 year with no internet connection would not hang on for even a fraction of that time.

_correct on both counts._ 

Marcus himself, of course, is a perfect paradigm of the Philosopher King (had there been a Harvard in the 2d C AD, he surely would have been on the cover of the alumni magazine). Yet he too had to face foreign wars, domestic intrigue and rebellious subordinates. Worst of all, despite his own genius, he made the fatal mistake of confusing educational credentials with actual ability when he chose his own son, the wastrel [Commodus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus), as his successor -- ending the only string of peaceful, successful handovers of power in Roman history. To quote a Cassius Dio:



> Just one thing prevented him from being completely happy, namely, that after rearing and educating his son in the best possible way he was vastly disappointed in him. This matter must be our next topic; for our history now descends from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust, as affairs did for the Romans of that day.
