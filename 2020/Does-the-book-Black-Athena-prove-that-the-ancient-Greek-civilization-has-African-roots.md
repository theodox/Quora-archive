It tries, but generally fails to prove that.

_Black Athena_ is almost entirely rejected by people working professionally in Egyptology, Greek history, or classical philology. It tends to be very popular among academics with an afrocentric bent who don’t actually fact-check its more audacious claims — particularly its very poor understanding of the ancient Egyptian language, its highly dubious theories about how Egyptian sources are to be dated, and its willingness to use sources that are over _a thousand years later_ than the events he describes as “proof” of its theories.

There’s a longer discussion of the limited success and larger failures of the book in [this answer.](https://www.quora.com/What-if-any-is-the-part-of-truth-to-Martin-Bernals-Black-Athena)
