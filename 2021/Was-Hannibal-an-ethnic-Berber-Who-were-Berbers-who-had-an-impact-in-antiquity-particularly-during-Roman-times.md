Hannibal was at least partially of Phoenician descent; his family all bore Punic names and he was a member of the Punic Carthaginian aristocracy.

The Carthaginians of his day were not completely insular: Hannibal’s sister [married a Numidian noble ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naravas)(the story became the basis for Flaubert’s [Salammbô](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salammb%C3%B4)) and the Numidians were the proto-Berber population of today Algeria. It’s not impossible that Hannibal had other Numidian or Libyan (the proto-Berbers of Tunisia and Libya) relations but it’s not recorded. By his day the Punic settlements in coastal Tunisia and Algeria were more than 500 years old.

After the defeat of Carthage, the Roman provinces in North Africa were a vital part of the empire more than 500 years. Numidians and Libyans were both part of the multinational Roman system — Numidian cavalry, for example, served in most Roman armies. And Berbers operated in the highest levels of Roman society. Among best known are [Marcus Cornelius Fronto, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Cornelius_Fronto)who was (among other things) the tutor of emperor Marcus Aurelius, [Apuleius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apuleius), a novelist; [Juba II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II) who was king of Mauretania but also a confidant of emperor Augustus, husband of Cleopatra’s daughter, and a noted naturalist; and the playwright [Terence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence). Two emperors — [Aemilianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aemilianus) and [Macrinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus) appear to have been of fully Berber origins (Libyan and Mauretanian, respectively). Emperor [Septimius Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus) was of mixed Italian, Punic and Berber ancestry, so were the Christian theologians [Tertullian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian) and [Augustine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo)

All that said: it’s important to remember that ancient ethnic categories aren’t entirely the same as ours. The ethnic or racial significance of names or birthplaces is often conjectural — the list above could easily be expanded if you included every famous Roman born in North Africa, or it might be contracted if you limited it to people (like, say, Fronto who jokes about his own origins) who were clearly given ethnic labels in their own time. The “ethnic” makeup of the Roman empire is similar to the “ethnic” makeup of a large American city, and confusions abound. Still, it’s clear that Berbers were successful members of the Roman world in a number of spheres.
