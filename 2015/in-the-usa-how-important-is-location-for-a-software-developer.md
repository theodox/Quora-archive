It depends a lot on specialization -- generic business application development is pretty wide spread, particularly for service oriented developers who need to be close to their customers. 

Other kinds of software work are geographically limited, mostly because the pool of potential employees is not evenly spread out -- it is vastly easier to find a full-stack web developer in the sf bay area than in Kansas City, since the Bay Area is a hub of web development and many developers move there looking for work; this creates a cycle where companies move to chase the workers and vice-versa, so that some types of development become very geographically limited. Easily 3/4ths of the game developers in the US, for example, are in Seattle, SF, LA or Austin -- the rest of the country accounts for far less than those cities.
