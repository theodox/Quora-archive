I think there may be a typo here: _inordinateo_  has to come from _[inordinatus](https://latin-dictionary.net/definition/23976/inordinatus-inordinata-inordinatum)_ __ but should not have that extra _e_ and it ought to agree with the grammatical gender of _pecunia._ 

In any case _inordinatus_ means “disordered”, “irregular” or “not by the rules”.

So, assuming it’s really _ex inordinata veni pecunia_ , it’s literally “I came from ‘disorderly’ money.” If somebody composed this a couple of hundred years ago, when society was more stratified and _ordo_  often meant “social class”, it probably means “I’m a self-made person” since in this case the speaker got their _pecunia_  without benefit of their _ordo_ , the class they were born into.

Otherwise it might be a backport from English of something like “I came from crazy money” or “I came from illegal money”.
