I don’t think there’s an exact equivalent.

The “business” side might be captured in _[munus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DM%3Aentry+group%3D52%3Aentry%3Dmunus)_ __ (plural _munera_ ) which literally means something like “a duty” or “a service” — originally, when you put on a gladiatorial fight to honor your ancestors, it was a _munus_  because you were fulfilling your obligation to the dead. Later _munera_  became the word for all sorts of public entertainments (gladiator shows, theatrical performances, and races) put on by ambitious politicians to gain support — nominally you were ‘doing your duty’ by the people. So an avid presenter of entertainments became a [munificus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dmunificus1), and in English the connotation of lavishness and extravagance becomes “munificent”.

Munificia would be the only high-status way to associate yourself with entertainment — the Romans enjoyed the theater but entertainers were regarded as vulgar (when emperor Nero appeared on stage to sing, it was a huge scandal). You would not brag about being an impresario in Latin — you’d hide behind the language of “duty” instead. Most Roman entertainments didn’t subsist on ticket sales: a politician would put on shows without charge for the PR benefits. There was still money changing hands, of course, but the ‘customer’ was the munificus, not the public.

For theater, rather than “business” _[theatralis](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dtheatralis)_ __ is the adjective “theatrical”; in Latin usage you could say _theatralia (_ in the plural) to mean “everything to do with the theater.” For entertainment in general the adjective would be _[ludicer](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dludicer)_ __ and the “everything about entertainment” form would be _ludicra._ People we’d call “show people” were _[scaenici](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dscaenicus)_  (singular _scaenicus_ )
