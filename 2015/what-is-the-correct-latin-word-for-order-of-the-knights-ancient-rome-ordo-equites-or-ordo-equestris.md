In ordinary usage Romans would just say _equites,_ "the knights". It would be equally correct -- if a little more formal -- to say either _ordo equestris_ , "the equestrian order" or (more rarely) _ordo equitum,_ "the order of the knights". Equestris is an adjective that declines like other 3-d declension words, its not a singular genitive in this case. 

_Ordo equester_  is grammatically the same as _ordo equestris_ , ie it's using an adjective to describe _ordo._  I'm not sure if the usage difference had any connotation to Roman ears, I have a vague feeling that _equester_  is the older form and _equestris_ is more common in late usage but I wouldn't swear to it. Cicero (who spent much of his career courting the equites for political support) uses _equester._ He also uses the longer _equites Romani equo publico,_ an unusual construction which is literally "Roman knights (of) the public horse" -- a phrase so stilted some people believe it was the official ancient title of the order, though the Romans in general were not overly beholden to bureaucratic naming.* 

_Ordo equites_  would not be grammatically correct, it would be 'order knights'

In the Middle Ages an actual knightly order (a very different thing from the _ordo equestris_ ) is an _ordo militum,_ using the same genitive plural as equitum (great list of example names here in [De hierarchia et iure ecclesiae militantis libri octo, in quibus de ecclesiae maiestate, fide, iuridictione, dignitate personarum tam ecclesiasticarum, quam saecularium](https://books.google.com/books?id=dTNT56U7-CIC&pg=PA301&lpg=PA301&dq=ordo+militum&source=bl&ots=HuAkxZ1L97&sig=y2CtjvwFU3qmfjbCsek5MB6Gyv4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgKahUKEwiq18yR1-DHAhVJoogKHeqUC38#v=onepage&q=ordo%20militum&f=false))

* The 'public horse' was -- by Cicero's day -- a dusty holdover from the days when the richest property class was required to do cavalry service in the army of the Republic. The 'private horse' equites were slightly lower down the property scale, wealthy enough to equip themselves as volunteer cavalry but not socially prominent enough to be granted a public horse. So Cicero's phrase may refer to the upper-crust of the _equites,_ who in his day were the second-wealthiest class in Rome after the senatorial elite.
