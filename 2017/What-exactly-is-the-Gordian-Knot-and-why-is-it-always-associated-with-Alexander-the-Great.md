As the other answers point out, the knot is supposed to have been a huge tangled knot associated with [Gordius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordias), the founder of the kingdom of Phrygia and, in legend, the father of Midas (the king who was cursed so that everything he touched turned to gold). There was an old prophecy that whoever could untie the knot would become master of all Asia. When Alexander great passed through the area during his war against Persia and was shown the local wonder, he undid it — usually, it’s said, by slicing it apart with his sword — thus fulfilling the prophecy as he went on to conquer the Persian empire.

The story has been a metaphor for finding a brilliantly simple solution to a knotty problem at least the past 2,000 years. The classic retelling comes from the _[Anabasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anabasis_of_Alexander)_  of the Greek historian Arrian, written in the 2d century so about 500 years after the events it describes:

> When Alexander came to Gordium, he had a very strong desire to go up to the acropolis, where the palace of Gordius and his son Midas was, to see Gordius’ wagon and the knot on the yoke of the wagon….. there was a story about the wagon, that whoever undid the knot of the yoke of the wagon was destined to rule Asia. The knot was made of cornel bark and it was impossible to see where it began or ended.

> Alexander was not able to discover how to undo the knot, but he did not wish to leave it still fastened, in case this provoked some disturbance amongst the many people there. Some writers say that he struck the knot with his sword and cut through it and claimed that it was now undone; however Aristobulus says that Alexander took the peg from the pole, which was a bolt driven through the pole all the way, and which held the knot together; he then drew the yoke of the pole. I am not able to say for certain what exactly Alexander did about this knot, but he and his companions certainly returned from the wagon as if the oracle about the untying of the knot had been fulfilled. That very night there was thunder and lightning in the heavens; because of this on the next day Alexander offered sacrifice to the gods that had shown these omens and also how to untie the knot.
