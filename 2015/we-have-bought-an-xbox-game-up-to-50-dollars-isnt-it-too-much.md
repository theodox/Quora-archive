Xbox game prices were set in 2000 at $50. For the XB 360 and PS3 they were set at $60 -- but the typical game budget increased more than 4X between the two generations because of higher technical requirements. XBOne / PS4 prices are still $60 -- adjusted for inflation, that's less than the prices for either of the previous systems:

Halo 1 (2001) $ 50 (2014 dollars) $__62__ 
Perfect Dark Zero ( 2005) $60 (2014 dollars) $__73__ 
Titanfall (2014) ----- (2014 dollars) $__60__ 

And of course in the 90's it was way worse: Super Mario 64 also debuted at $50 in 1997, which is over $75 in 2014 dollars.

So, prices are really going _down_, even though the dollar number is constant. The numbers on Steam are even steeper, now that many customers assume deep discounts are coming and wait for them. 

Meanwhile most development costs are higher. Typical budgets in the first decade of this century were well under $10 million dollars. By contrast GTA V and Destiny both cost over $__400 million__  to make.

So, overall, no: you're not paying too much. The games business is not flush with money, lots of studios have gone out of business, and many others have to switch to aggressive F2P schemes to keep going.
