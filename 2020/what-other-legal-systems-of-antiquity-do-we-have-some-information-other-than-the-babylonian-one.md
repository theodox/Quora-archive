There’s a good deal of information, though it’s not usually in the form of a complete “law code” like Hammurabi. Actual “laws” are typically the tip of the iceberg: the reality of a legal system involves precedents and case-law.

Hammurabi’s code is not the only example in __Mesopotamia.__ Among the competing legal systems on record are the [Code of Ur-Nammu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Ur-Nammu), which is actually older than Hammurabi’s, and the even earlier edicts of [Urukagina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urukagina). Later Mesopotamian cultures continued the practice of collecting decrees or precedents: for more than a thousand years scribes and jurists in Babylonia and Assyria continued to copy and study the older legal texts even when they were no longer in force — the preservation of so many cuneiform tablets (much more durable than paper, at least when baked intentionally or by a fire) allows us to see a lot of the details of Mesopotamian law as it evolved over the two millennia from Ur-Nammu to Alexander the Great.

It’s well known that the Mesopotamian codes are echoed in many parts of the __Bible__ as well: the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy (which translates to “Second Law”) contain the legal framework of ancient Israel by at least the period of the Persian empire, two and a half millennia ago. These show some clear similarities to the Mesopotamian codes but also a number of critical differences. The rabbinic interpretation Jewish law is still a living legal tradition, with a continuous history of interpretation and debate going back through the __[Talmud and the Mishna](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-oral-law-talmud-and-mishna)__ , which emerged from the rabbinic communities of Judea and Mesopotamia between 1900 and 2300 years ago. There’s even some first hand evidence of day-to-day law; a [cache of documents the Jewish community of Elephantine Island](https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/exhibitions/752), on the southern frontier of Egypt under the Persian empire provides an interesting example of Jewish Law in practice — one which has both remarkable continuity with, but also surprising deviations from, later and more familiar Jewish laws.

We know a great deal about the __Roman legal system__ , at least in its late-Republican and imperial forms, thanks to the [Corpus Juris Civilis](https://www.ancient.eu/Corpus_Juris_Civilis/), the collection of Roman law published in the 6th century which includes many excerpts and quotations from the previous millennium of Roman law. We’ve also got the first-hand witness of [Cicero,](https://www.unrv.com/roman-republic/cicero.php) the most successful trial lawyer of the first century BC, who left us (slightly polished up) versions of his courtroom speeches that give us a very intimate view of what a Roman jury might hear, at least on the high end of the social-criminal scale. Much further back, around 450 BC, we have the text of the [Twelve Tables](https://www.ancient.eu/Twelve_Tables/#:~:text=The%20Twelve%20Tables%20(aka%20Law,be%20treated%20equally%20before%20them), the oldest written Roman laws — like many ancient codes they represent a political moment when ordinary people forced the aristocrats and clan elders to write down the traditional codes which, before that point, had been primarily oral and thus easier for the aristocrats and elders who administered the system to manipulate.

The __Ancient Greek__  legal system is not as copiously documented but there is still a fair bit of surviving evidence similar to the Roman system. Most of our information is about Athens, because the intensely political atmosphere of classical Athens made a lot of legal matters into issues for public debate. In that context we have the trial speeches of [Demosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosthenes), [Aeschines](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/aeschines/), and [Isocrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isocrates) — which, in typical Athenian fashion are usually intertwined with contemporary policy issues. There’s even a parody of Athenian courts in Aristophanes’ comedy [The Wasps](https://www.ancient.eu/The_Wasps/). The [Constitution of the Athenians](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/athenian_const.1.1.html) attributed to Aristotle is a snapshot of the overall structure of Athenian law in the fourth century BC; Aristotle and his students also produced similar studies of the structures of other Greek states, and even of [Carthage](https://www.ancient.eu/article/193/aristotle-on-the-constitution-of-carthage-c-340-bc/), as part of their systematic studies of political theory. Only a few of the primary documents survive; the most famous is the [Code of Gortyn](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/450-gortyn.asp), a Greek city in Crete.

An interesting side-light is the hybrid legal system of __Greco-Roman Egypt__ ___.___ The desert climate of Egypt has preserved a lot of day-to-day material that does not survive for most ancient cultures. Under the Ptolemies (starting in 332 BC) and the Romans (from 31 BC down to the Arab conquest) Egypt was a heavily bureaucratic plantation state: most people’s personal mobility and choice of professions were highly regulated, and — uniquely for the ancient world — we see [bits and pieces of the daily machinery of the state in the form of census registries, travel permits, and disputes about personal identification along with more expected matters like inheritance, marriage, and criminal law](https://amzn.to/2R9lhZ1).

On the other hand we are __[surprisingly uninformed about ancient Egyptian law.](https://www.ancient.eu/Egyptian_Law/#:~:text=The%20law%20in%20ancient%20Egypt,enforced%20those%20rules%20and%20brought)__ We have never found an Egyptian equivalent of the code of Hammurabi — a single authoritative declaration of laws. On the other hand we do have some chance bits and pieces which give us some idea of how the system worked. For example the [Amherst Papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst_Papyrus) and the [Abbott Papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Papyrus) give us a detailed look at the investigation and punishment of tomb robberies. One commonly copied text is [The Tale of the Eloquent Peasant](https://www.ancient.eu/article/1127/the-eloquent-peasant--egyptian-justice/), which details a (fictional) lawsuit between a humble peasant and a powerful landowner which is ultimately taken all the way to the Pharoah himself.

The early middle ages are not really “antiquity” by most definitions, but during the collapse of the western Roman Empire the new, barbarian ruling classes often found it useful to record their own cultural legal practices into a written form, usually one which existed alongside the existing Roman laws of the day. These __“barbarian laws”__  reflect much older practices. Examples include the sixth century [Lex Burgundionum ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Burgundionum)(“Laws of the Burgundians”) and the [Salic law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salic_law). To some degree the Irish [Brehon Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Irish_law) can be seen as part of a similar process of converting an ancient oral tradition into a written code. In all these cases the transition is not a simple 1:1 recording of older traditions but it does provide a snapshot of how traditional law functioned in a number of societies.
