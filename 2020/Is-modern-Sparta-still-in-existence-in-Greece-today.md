Yes. Unfortunately there’s not a lot of ancient Sparta left to see — [compared to it’s rivals Sparta was not regarded in antiquity as architecturally impressive. ](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Thucydides-say-of-Sparta-that-future-generations-would-find-it-very-difficult-to-believe-that-the-place-had-really-been-as-powerful-as-it-was-represented-to-be/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=b2ccb9cb&srid=zLvM)However there’s a modern town located on or near the ancient city, and there are a number of interesting (though, unfortunately, not particularly well preserved) archeaological sites nearby.
