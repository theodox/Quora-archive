Egypt had a very substantial Jewish population. In some places the Jewish communities went back to the Persian period before Alexander’s conquest. In Alexandria there was a large Jewish community; a first century Jewish writer claimed that Jews were the majority in two of the city’s five quarters. No source tells us how large the Alexandrian community was — but contemporary accounts of communal violence in 66 show a community large enough to survive the massacre of 50,000 of its members by Roman legions. A high estimate might make it as much as a quarter of the city’s population, so perhaps 150,000. Another first-century Jewish writer suggested that there were a million Jews in Egypt, about one person in seven.

The large and well-organized Jewish community was a factor in Ptolemaic politics: Jewish generals and soldiers played a key role in the Ptolemaic civil wars between Ptolemy VI and Ptolemy VII and then again between Cleopatra III and Ptolemy IX. Alexandrian Jews continued to be prominent under the Romans as well: [Tiberius Julius Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Julius_Alexander) was Titus’s second-in-command at the capture of Jerusalem, even though he was born Jewish in Alexandria.

As for Cleopatra (the famous one is Cleopatra VII) she evidently feared and distrusted her Jewish subjects — at least if we can believe the first-century Jewish historian Josephus. At the end of he reign he claimed she opined that “she had some hope of preserving her affairs still, in case she could kill the Jews, though it were with her own hand.” Greco-Jewish relations in Alexandria deteriorated seriously in the Roman period,. with major outbreaks of violence in [38](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandrian_riots_(38)) and [66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_riot_(66)). The Jewish population of Egypt was essentially wiped out in the [Kitos War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War) of 115 and took centuries to recover.
