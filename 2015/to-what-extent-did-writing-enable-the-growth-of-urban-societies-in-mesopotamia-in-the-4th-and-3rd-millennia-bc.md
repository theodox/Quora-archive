In general, you can have urban life and illiteracy; that's the commonest way to do it over time. 

The Mesopotamian case is a bit unusual because the particular form of urbanism that evolved there: the Sumerian cities of the [Uruk period](http://www.historicity.org/?p=70) are often described as 'theocratic': the cities are thought to have been [highly bureaucratic and centralized](http://richard-hooker.com/sites/worldcultures/MESO/SUMER.HTM), a kind of organization that is impossible without writing. The emergence of such an involved form of organization at the very dawn of urbanism is a puzzle, but the documents certainly seem show lots of economic micro-management. It's even thought that writing itself evolved out of tally-marks and other kinds of accounting devices.
