# Why do we talk of 'Hellenistic Greek' (contrasted with which Greek)? If we go by the simple assumption that Greek and Hellenic are synonyms, aren't we then repeating ourselves? Was there a time when Greek was not Hellenistic?

The distinction is between the period before Alexander’s conquests, when Greek culture was more or less interchangeable with Greek ethnicity, and the long period from Alexander to the later Roman era when many people participated in Greek culture without being of Greek descent or self-identifying as Greeks. Hellenistic culture was basically international.

Neither a Jew like Philo of Alexandria nor an Egyptian like his nemesis Apion were ethnically Greek, and neither wanted to “pass” as Greek. However they conducted their polemics in Greek and used cultural touchstones like the philosophy of Plato and the poems of Homer in most of what they wrote. There are plenty of similar examples, from Carthage and Rome to the deserts of Afghanistan. That’s why “Hellenistic” makes a useful distinction.
