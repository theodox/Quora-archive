There were significant Jewish communities in the Levant, but there’s no reason to think Judaism ever became the majority religion outside the immediate vicinity of Judea. The largest Jewish communities outside Judea and Samaria were in Egypt (Alexander and his successors brought Jews to Egypt in pretty large numbers) and in Mesopotamia where the part of the community which didn’t return after the Babylonian captivity became fairly numerous and prosperous. There was a Jewish presence in Carthage, but there’s no evidence that it was particularly larger or powerful

Wells may be confused by the fact that many Jews in the Roman empire spoke Aramaic, rather than Hebrew as their primary language; since Aramaic was the _lingua franca_ of the whole near east the line between one set of Semitic people speaking Aramaic another might not have looked obvious to him, particularly through the early -20th-century lenses he applied to his subject matter.
