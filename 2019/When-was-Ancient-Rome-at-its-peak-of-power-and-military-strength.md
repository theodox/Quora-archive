The traditional date of the “zenith” is the year 117, which marked the maximum extent of Rome’s territorial expansion following Trajan’s conquest of Mesopotamia.

Many historians think Trajan’s war in the east was a strategic mistake, overextending the empire’s military and endangering the frontiers for the sake of loot and glory. However there is no question that Trajan’s footprints in the sands of Babylon are the high water mark of Roman territorial expansion. Trajan’s successor Hadrian evidently decided that this was an overreach, and pulled the Roman frontier back to the line of the Euphrates in Syria within a couple of years. After 117 there were no large-scale conquests of new territory; portions of Mesopotamia were reconquered in 198 but essentially Trajan was the last emperor to conquer new, never-before-occupied lands for Rome.

It’s harder to compare military strength over time.

Trajan fielded around 400,000 soldiers (150,000 legionaries and the rest auxiliaries and allies) against the Dacians and the Parthians. The numerical peak of Roman military manpower actually came much later, under Diocletian (around the year 300) when the nominal strength of the army may have surpassed 600,000. However by that time the Roman military had developed into a two-tier force; the bulk of Diocletian’s army was made up of _[limitanei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitanei)_ , garrison troops who manned fixed fortifications and did light paramilitary duty in penny-packets along the frontiers. The mobile armies (the _[comitatenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comitatenses)_ and the _[palatini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatini_(Roman_military))_ ) numbered less than 250,000 all told.

It’s not really clear how the fighting power of Diocletian’s larger army compares with Trajan’s. We know from many sources that the effort of fielding that large force nearly bankrupted the Roman state (already reeling from several decades of intermittent civil wars) and that the government struggled mightily to keep those troops fed, equipped, and paid; if nothing else that suggests that in a hypothetical matchup the Rome of 300 was at its maximum capacity while the Rome of 117 had significant reserves of money and manpower . It’s also hard to gauge the impact of demographics: we suspect that the population in 300 was actually smaller than it was in 117 due to the demographic effects of serious plagues (in the 160’s and the 250’s) and the disruption caused by a the endemic civil wars of the years 235–297.

All of which, taken together, shows that 117 is the high-water mark of Roman military power as well as territorial extent, even though there were many ups and downs in the succeeding centuries.
