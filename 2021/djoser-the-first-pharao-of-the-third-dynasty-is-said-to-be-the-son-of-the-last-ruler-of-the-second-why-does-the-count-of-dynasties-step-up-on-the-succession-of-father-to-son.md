# Djoser, the first Pharao of the third dynasty, is said to be the son of the last ruler of the second. Why does the count of dynasties step up on the succession of father to son?

This goes back at least to [Manetho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho), the Hellenistic-era Egyptian priest who collected the list of dynasties that forms the backbone of our list today. His lists were preserved mostly in quotations by later writers but they were used by several so we have a reasonable idea of what he wrote. Here’s how it was quoted by the Church historian Eusebius of Caesarea:

> The Third Dynasty consisted of eight kings of Memphis:

> 1. Necherôchis, in whose reign the Libyans revolted against Egypt, and when the moon waxed beyond reckoning, they surrendered in terror.

> 2. He was succeeded by Sesorthos [in whose reign flourished Imuthes = Imhotep] he was styled Asclepios in Egypt because of his medical skill. He was also the inventor of the art of building with hewn stone, and devoted attention to writing as well.

Here it’s long been assume that _Necherôchis_ (in a different version of the quote, “Necherophis”) is [Nebka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebka), a poorly attested pharaoh who shows up in the right place in a couple of New-Kingdom era king lists and _Sesorthos_  (in other versions, “Tosorthos”) is Djoser based on comparison with surviving king lists from the New Kingdom, such as the [Abydos Canon](https://pharaoh.se/abydos-canon) and the [Turin King List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin_King_List).

However, many modern Egyptologists don’t believe Nebka actually occupied the throne in between Djoser and his father, [Khasekhemwy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khasekhemwy). It’s been suggested that New Kingdom era scholars misplaced Nebka from later in the third dynasty. The surviving king lists are all more than a thousand years removed in time from the third dynasty — and Manetho was nearly as far removed from them. So, we can’t be too critical of his accuracy.

Nonetheless the division of the dynasties as we have it comes from Manetho, although we assume it was traditional in Egyptian records before his time. The logic can only be inferred, but the fact that the new “dynasty” ruled from Memphis may mark the dividing line (the first and second dynasties both ruled from Thinis).
