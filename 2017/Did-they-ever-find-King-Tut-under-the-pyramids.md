No. Tut was buried in the [Valley of the Kings, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_the_Kings)in a rock-cut tomb.

Pyramid burials had largely stopped well before Tut’s time. He died around 1323 BC, but the last pyramid built before him was about 400 years earlier. Two others were built later by Nubian kings during the [Kushite Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt), but in native Egyptians had given up on pyramids long before Tut.

In any case his very short reign of 9 years was not enough time to build a full-size pyramid. His [successors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horemheb) were not fond of Tut’s family and would not have worked hard on memorializing him.
