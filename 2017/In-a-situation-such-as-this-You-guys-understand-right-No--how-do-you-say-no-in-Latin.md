_scitisne?_ is probably what you want. _scitis_  is “you (pl) know” or “you understand”, and adding the -_ne_  turns int into a question with the expected answer “yes” . A slightly stronger yes-expectation would be _nonne scitis?, “_ don’t you get it?”

If you expect a no, you’d say _num scitis?_  (“you don’t get it, do you?”)

If you were trying to prompt an answer you might stick a _non_ in there were you add the “No” in English, but that’s more of a mannerism than proper Latin speech. A more idiomatic thing might be to add a second verb:

_scitisne? num prehenditis?_ 

“You get it, right? Don’t you understand?”
