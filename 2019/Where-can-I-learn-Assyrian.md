[There an app for that!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/learn-assyrian/id1243080970?mt=8) Really!

But for proper context: strictly speaking you have to be clear about what you mean when you say “Assyrian.” The Assyrian civilization generally wrote in [Akkadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language), which over time morphed into [Aramaic.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_language)

Akkadian is tricky to learn, because the original material is all written in [cuneiform](https://www.ancient.eu/cuneiform/), which (speaking for myself, anyway) is one of the most difficult writing systems to learn. Apart from that, you are in luck: Quora’s own [Joachim Pense](https://www.quora.com/profile/Joachim-Pense) just started [Santakku](https://santakku.quora.com/), a Quora Space devoted to issues in Mesopotamian languages and I believe he’s going to be blogging his own experiences trying to learn. I have a copy of [A Manual of Akkadian](https://www.amazon.com/Manual-Akkadian-David-Marcus/dp/0819106089), which is geared towards university students; I’ve found it tough going but if you had experience with another Semitic language like Hebrew or Arabic I suspect it would be a good bit easier.

The later variant, [Assyrian Neo-Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_Neo-Aramaic), lives on as the language of the [Assyrian / Chaldaean minorities in Iraq and Syria](https://www.quora.com/How-many-ancient-Assyrians-are-still-left-today). as well as [their diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian%E2%80%93Chaldean%E2%80%93Syriac_diaspora) around the world. After more than a century of conflict in their homelands, the Assyrian and the other flavors of Neo-Aramaic are under serious threat at home. Several Assyrian groups offer online lessons or videos as well, for example:

[Intro To Modern Assyrian - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDD993EF86AB9A547)

(A bit of googling or YouTube checking will find plenty more. You may want to use “Syriac|Assyrian|Aramaic” rather than just “Assyrian” as a search term to broaden your results.

Diaspora religious communities are probably the best resources if you’re looking for a person-to-person connection to the language. Outside of the beleaguered communities in the Middle East, different flavors of Aramaic are used as liturgical languages in various Assyrian churches; this is one of the main things keeping this language family alive. So if the app store isn’t enough, you’ll have more luck looking up the closest outpost of the [Assyrian Church of the East](https://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/holy-apostolic-catholic-assyrian-church-of-the-east), the [Chaldean Catholic Church](https://www.catholicsandcultures.org/eastern-catholic-churches/chaldean-catholic-church), the [Syriac Orthodox Church](http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/) — most of these communities offer classes to their parishioners. Many Orthodox Jewish communities also teach the [Babylonian form of Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Babylonian_Aramaic), because its so important in the evolution of the Talmud. And a lot of theological institutions teach classical Syriac (the form of the language what as common before the Arab conquest) because so much early Christian literature arose among the Aramaic-language communities of Syria and Mesopotamia.
