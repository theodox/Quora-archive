Ancient ones? None — that was a _long_ time ago.

However the _modern_ [Assyrian people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people) are estimated to number between about 2 and 4 million worldwide.

Until fairly recently the community was most numerous in the traditional Assyrian heartland, spread across northern Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northwest Iran, and eastern Syria. However the aftermath of the Iraq war has led to a lot of out-migration from Iraq in particular; since most Assyrians are Christian, they are often treated poorly in their home countries.

In the US, Detroit and [Chicago ](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/86.html)both have fairly large Assyrian communities: in Chicago you can buy a used car from the lots on King Sargon Boulevard for a bargain of biblical proportions.

One of the side effects of the large Assyrian diaspora in the US is the [ready availability of Assyrian-themed T-Shirts](https://amzn.to/2MyqeaP) — a luxury that few other bronze-age empires can boast.
