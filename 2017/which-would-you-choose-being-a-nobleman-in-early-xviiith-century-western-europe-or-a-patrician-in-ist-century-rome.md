Oh _early_  18th century Europe! Not just for the wigs, either.

Being a member of the political upper classes in first century Rome was a bad, bad gig. The patriciate* of the first century had the worst of both worlds: it was politically defanged — Rome was, at this point, the empire and not the republic, so it being from one of the great families didn’t guarantee you a shot at power — but it was also politically suspect.

If you were lucky and well connected at court, you might get to be consul, maybe for as long as six months — but it would be a largely ceremonial job with no real decision making power. The likeliest outcome would be that you’d have to spend a lot of your own money on games or festivals to keep up appearances. But you would never get to negotiate a treaty, pass a law, or lead an army: those things were reserved for Caesar and his close confidantes. In fact, the key jobs running the empire were explicitly forbidden to members of the Senatorial elite, because the early emperors still recalled the ruinous political conflicts that had brought down the Republic — anybody with a significant name and enough money to be in the Senate might become the nucleus of potential opposition.

The first several decades of the empire took a serious toll on the remnants of the old aristocracy: the more paranoid emperors (Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero and eventually Domitian) were obsessively worried about political challenges arising from the aristocracy. Secret police, spies and informers abounded. Since the usual practice would be for the informer to get a slice of your estate as a reward (and for the emperor to take the rest) accusations were common and acquittals were few. Almost none of the great old families of the republic survived into the second century, at least not with enough money to show up in the public records that remain to us.

By contrast, most 18th century European aristocrats had it pretty good. There were still opportunities for power and a chance to make a name for yourself to add to your family name. Some places — in particular, the France of Louis XIV — kept their aristocrats in what amounted to gilded cages: like the Caesars, the Bourbons worried about challenges from the aristocracy and made a point of keeping them where they could be watched. On the whole, though, the early 18th century still offered a lot of opportunities to a nobleman in politics and warfare (and the church, if you were a younger son who could be spared): if you’re enough of an aristocrat to really want to grab your page in the history books, it’s a far more congenial environnment than the claustrophobic confines of first century Rome.

On the other hand after, say, 1789 things are not quite so rosy. But that’s another story.



*By the first century the ‘plebeian / patrician’ divide was several centuries in the past; the patricians had lost exclusive control of Roman politics more than three centuries earlier. A patrician lineage was about as relevant as a European title of nobility is today.
