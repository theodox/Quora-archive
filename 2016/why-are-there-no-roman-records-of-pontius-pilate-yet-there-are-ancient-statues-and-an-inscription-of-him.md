# Why are there no Roman records of Pontius Pilate, yet there are ancient statues and an inscription of him?

He's in pretty familiar territory in this regard. It almost impossible to over-estimate how much information about the Roman world has been lost. 

People who were far more important to the Roman world than Pilate have little or no contemporary testimony: as the governor of a not-particularly important backwater province it's not at all surprising that we know little about him. 

For comparison, consider emperor [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan) (reigned 98-117). He was arguably the most powerful of all Roman emperors, presiding over the peak of Roman prosperity and territorial expansion. He was literally __the most famous, most powerful man in the Roman world__  of his day. The only direct, contemporary literary references to him are 

[a fawning speech from one his courtiers,](http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511920578&cid=CBO9780511920578A007) and about [100 short memos ](http://pages.pomona.edu/~cmc24747/sources/plin_6-10.htm#book10) (mostly a couple of sentences each) exchanged between the same courtier and the emperor.

Four short [philosophical treatises on kingship](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/1*.html), delivered by a Greek philosopher / politician on an embassy to Rome and mostly full of complicated allegories drawn from Greek mythology. 

A paraphrase of the history written by [Cassius Dio](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html) a hundred years after Trajan as summarized a Byzantine chronicler 750 years later.

That's it for contemporary sources. No records of policy, no accounts of battles or diplomacy, not even much in the way of gossip. For the man who ruled the world. It's like a world where you only knew about Barak Obama from a single article in People, six months of Twitter feed from the secretary of the interior, and a sidebar from a history textbook written in the year 2150. 

In that world, how much would you expect to know about, say, Bobby Jindal?
