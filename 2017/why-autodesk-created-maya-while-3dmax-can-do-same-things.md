Autodesk didn’t actually “create” Maya, or Max - or SoftImage, for that matter — it bought all of them. The 3d market tends to be pretty “sticky” — artists like to stay with the software they know best, and studios often invest in add-ons or integrations that tie them pretty closely to a particular piece of software. Thus, it makes a certain amount of sense to keep offering both sets of software (XSI was discontinued a couple of years ago).

It’s not a great situation for the industry, because the pressure for both products to evolve is less intense. On the other hand, it keeps a lot of diehard Max (or Maya) fans from being forced to switch against their wills.
