Unity is a great platform to learn on. As you can tell from the answers, it's something you can pick up on your own, with no costs to speak of beyond your own time and energy. You can be productive in a few months if you have prior programming experience, and certainly within a year even if not. If you have reasonable brains and drive, you will be able to make good use of it and have fun with it. It took me about three months to feel really comfortable with Unity, but I've been around computers and games for a long time. On the other hand I started at 47 so its _absolutely_  not too late!

As far as the going Indie for a career -- well, the industry is almost entirely self selected. If you can learn the ropes and make a game, you're an indie developer. 

However, do be sure you're realistic about what you're getting into financially. The indie scene is a lot like the punk music movement was a generation a go: it's full of amazing energy and incredible things come out of it. It produces as handful of superstars who will go from outsiders to icons. Unfortunately it's not an easy way to make a living:

I don't want that to discourage you. Like any creative career games is a mix of passion and calculation (my old creative writing teacher used to say _If you can do something besides writing for a living... you should._ ) Even if you never make a dime on your games making them is at least as much fun as playing and you never know where it might lead - to a 'straight' games industry job, to something else in tech, or even into education or design. As the saying goes, though _don't quit your day job..._ 
_...yet_ .
