The __[Cypriot syllabary](https://omniglot.com/writing/cypriot.htm)__ ____ is a linguistic [coelacanth](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/group/coelacanths/): a living fossil of the Bronze Age which survived almost into the Roman empire. While Plato and Aristotle were arguing in the groves of the Akademos, Cypriot Greeks were still writing in a script that was practically [Linear A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_A).

_A stater of_ _[Evagoras I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evagoras_I)_ _, king of Salamis in Cyprus (reigned 411‚Äì374 BC) inscribed with his name E-u-wa-ko-ro on the obverse and king pa-si-le-wo on the reverse. At the bottom of the reverse are the Greek letters ŒïŒ•. The inscription reads right to left, so ê†¶ ro ê†ç ko ê†≤ wa ê†Ñ u ê†Å e._ 

Cyprus was a kind of Bronze Age time capsule. It weathered the collapse of the major Bronze Age civilizations with less disruption than we see in Greece, Anatolia or the Levant. The island's biggest center, at [Enkomi](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/enkomi/) was sacked during the age of the Sea Peoples ‚Äî but unlike many other victims of the late Bronze Age chaos the city was rebuilt. But more than settlement patterns survived: Unlike Greece, where literacy came to an abrupt halt when the Mycenaean kingdoms fell at the end of the Bronze Age, Cyprus remained literate.

__‚ÄúLinear C,‚Äù 1500‚Äì1000 BC__ 

The original inhabitants of Cyprus used the so-called "Linear C" ‚Äî a script that's clearly directly related to Cretan Linear A and thus, indirectly, to Mycenaean [Linear B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B#:~:text=Linear%20B%20is%20a%20syllabic,dates%20to%20about%201450%20BC.). Unfortunately it's hard for us to know exactly how. Some signs are the same in both scripts, but there are also unique ones in Cypro-Minoan. The sign list is also much shorter. By comparison, the genetic relationship between Linear A and Linear B is much more obvious, so the script is more often known as [Cypro-Minoan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypro-Minoan_syllabary), to avoid a misleading impression about it being a 'successor' to Linear B. Cypro-Minoan script was a successful script, though we can‚Äôt read it; it‚Äôs found not only in Cyprus but also in the Levant and Canaan where it‚Äôs sometimes known as [Levanto-Minoan](https://books.google.com/books?id=4kYaLOzrEK4C&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117). There are samples from Ashkelon which may represent the Philistine language written in C-M script.

Paradoxically, our understanding of the way literacy survived in Crete is hampered by the fact that Cyprus fared pretty well in the years between the 12th and 8th centuries BC. The Cypriots wrote for the most part on clay, so, in the absence of catastrophic fires, most of what they wrote moldered away or was recycled. Our samples of Cypro-Minoan proper are limited to only about 250 objects, most incised with a single word or two, which has made it impossible to properly decipher the Cypriot language.

__The syllabary, 1000‚Äì800 BC__ 

By around the 10th century BC, Cypro-Minoan had been simplified into a smaller, more regularized set of glyphs with no ideographs. The native population of Cyprus continued to used it to write their own language.* However the Greek population of Cyprus also began to use this simpler script to write Greek, using very much the same kind of syllabic writing strategy that the Myceneans had applied to create Linear B. We don't know how far back this process goes, but the oldest Greek writing from Cyprus is from the 11th century BC. Scholars argue about whether it's an early example of the classic syllabary or a late form of Cypro-Minoan. But in either case, it demonstrates that there was no break in Greek literacy in Cyprus like the illiterate centuries that followed the fall of Mycenae in Greece.

__Heyday, 800‚Äì400 BC__ 

The mature syllabary really began to flourish in Greek hands in the 8th century BC. Unlike its cousins, Linear A and Linear B, Cypriot script became a vehicle for ordinary people. For example in Egypt we find graffiti carved by Cypriot mercenaries working for Egyptian pharaohs of the 7th century ‚Äî evidence for a diffusion of literacy that the older scripts never matched. Some variants of the [Carian alphabet ](https://omniglot.com/writing/carian.php)include characters that seem to be Cypriot, suggesting informal mixing through trade or brought home by Carian mercenaries who also served in Egypt.

Despite its success, however, Cypriot never completely standardized. The island was politically fragmented ‚Äî Assyrian records identify as many as ten distinct kingdoms on the island in the early 7th century BC. Politically the Greeks tended to dominate, but the island was an ethnic patchwork with substantial Cypriot and Phoenician populations. In fact, it was a [Phoenician-Greek bilingual inscription from Idalion](https://crewsproject.wordpress.com/2018/01/28/crews-display-the-idalion-bilingual/) in east-central Cyprus which made it possible for us to decipher the script in the late 19th century. The island‚Äôs cultural diversity produced an erratic orthography: the syllabary came in two distinct flavors, a 'common' version with 55 signs written right to left and a variant centered on [Paphos ](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/paphos/)in the southwest written with 54 signs from left to right.

__Competition with alphabetic writing 600‚Äì300 BC__ 

Perhaps because the Cypriot writing system was not limited to a social elite or a professional scribal class, it was remarkably tenacious.

Alphabetic writing started spreading in Greece from around the end of the ninth century BC thanks to the influence of Phoenician traders. The Greeks added vowel signs to the consonantal Phoenician characters, creating a remarkably successful family of scripts which of course ultimately includes the one you're reading here. However the Cypriot syllabary hung on in Cyprus long after the rest of the Greek speaking world had adopted alphabetic writing.

Cypriot Greeks were evidently sometimes literate in alphabetic Greek as well. For example, as early as the 6th century BC there's a gravestone from Marion which is digraphic in Greek and Cypriot characters (though the Greek is written right to left). Nevertheless the syllabary remained dominant until after the age of Alexander. Besides conservatism, this might be a simple matter of economy: since the Cypriot states had substantial Eteocypriot populations, it may simply have been smarter to use the same script for both languages, as we can see from a number of bilingual inscriptions.

Before the classical era, Cyprus was more closely connected to the Near East than to the Greek world. The island was tributary to the Assyrians in the eighth century and then to the Persians starting in the sixth, so the need to fit in other Greeks was less than pressing.

Eventually, though, sustained Greek-Persian conflicts encouraged the islanders to take sides. All of Cyprus ‚Äî apart from the Eteocypriot-majority kingdom of [Amathus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amathus) ‚Äî joined the [Ionian Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Revolt#Cyprus) in 498 BC. The suppression of the revolt involved substantial support from a Phoenician fleet; in the aftermath, the Phoenician-speaking kingdom of [Kition ](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/kition/)acted as the local Persian at the expense of the Greek and Eteocypriot states. It's possible that this, too, encouraged the retention of the syllabary as a symbol of Greek-Eteocypriot unity.

Politics, however, is a fickle friend to culture. At the end of the fifth century the ambitious king [Evagoras of Salamis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evagoras_I) cast his lot with the Athenians. He provided support to the irredentist Athenian admiral [Conon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conon), who used Persian money and Cypriot ships to destroy the Spartan navy at [Knidos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knidos) in 394 ‚Äî heralding Athens‚Äô return to the stage as a great power after its defeat in the Peloponnesian war. Evagoras was restive under Persian rule and for most of the next twenty years he was at war with his nominal overlords. He evidently recruited anti-Persian Greeks as part of his efforts: Isocrates, for example, said that [many people emigrated from Greece to Cyprus out of admiration for Evagoras](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0144%3Aspeech%3D9%3Asection%3D51) ‚Äî almost certainly a political puff piece, but a significant one nonetheless.

Although Cyprus remained a nominal part of the Persian empire until Alexander's time, the increasing use of alphabetic Greek became a visible symbol of Cypriot connection to the Greek world and, implicitly, rejection of Persian power. The island‚Äôs kings used digraphic, and then purely alphabetic inscriptions in the years after Evagoras**. By the end of the century Paphos was issuing coins like this:

However the diplomatic niceties of Cypriot script were quickly eclipsed by a cruder calculus. After Alexander's death in 325 BC, Cyprus was thrown into the cutthroat politics of the Successors. The Ptolemies were particularly covetous: after the battle of [Ipsus](https://www.livius.org/articles/battle/ipsus/) in 301 BC, they were the undisputed masters of the island and would remain so down until the Romans took the island in 58 BC.*** None of the native dynasties (Eteocypriot, Phoenician, or Greek) survived.

Under the Ptolemies, alphabetic Koine Greek became the language of politics and prestige. Where older bilingual inscription matched Arcado-Cypriot Greek and Eteocypriot or Phoenician, their third-century equivalents used alphabetic Koine alongside other languages. In any case, the Phoenician and Cypriot languages declined under the Ptolemaic administration and the island seems to become entirely Hellenised by the Roman era.

__Twilight 300‚Äì180 BC__ 

Nonetheless the syllabary hung on in other contexts. It seems likely that the archaism of the script kept it alive in ritual contexts after it had fallen out of use for practical purposes. It was still being used in religious dedications into the second century BC. This one from Golgoi is late third century:

The latest known examples are a dedications at a rural shrine, the [nymphaeum of Kafizin](https://journals.openedition.org/kernos/2101?lang=en). The exact date are debated: the early estimated dates are around 220 BC, the late estimate is around forty years later.

We don't have any later examples than that, so it's unlikely the script survived more into the common era, though it‚Äôs not impossible.

The history of the Cypriot syllabary is a remarkable example of a continuity in a region dominated by change. That last lonely dedicant in Kafzin was part of an unbroken writing tradition which reached all the way back to Cretan hieroglyphics two millennia before ‚Äî and he used it to write a Greek that would have been recognizable to a Mycenaean, centuries before the fall of Troy.



* This language, known as [Eteocypriot,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eteocypriot_language) survived into the Hellenistic era. Unfortunately we can't read it, even though we can sound it out. It‚Äôs quite possible that the C-M script encodes two or three different languages. Between that uncertainty and the paucity of samples it‚Äôs unlikely we‚Äôll ever decipher Eteocypriot in detail.

** Here again the outlier was Eteocypriot Amathus, which never issued coins with alphabetic inscriptions.

*** Cicero was governor of the island in 51; it‚Äôs tempting to connect his sponsorship of [Tironian shorthand](https://www.translationdirectory.com/articles/article2495.php), which was syllabic, with Cypriot. Unfortunately we know that the system was already in use more than a decade before.
