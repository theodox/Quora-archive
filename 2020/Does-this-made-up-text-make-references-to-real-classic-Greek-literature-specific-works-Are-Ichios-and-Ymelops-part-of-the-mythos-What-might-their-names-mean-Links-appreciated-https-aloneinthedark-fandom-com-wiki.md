# Does this made-up text make references to real classic Greek literature (specific works)? Are Ichios and Ymelops part of the mythos? What might their names mean? Links appreciated. https://aloneinthedark.fandom.com/wiki/Extract_from_the_Golden_Fleece

Those don’t look right .

Ymelops would be _____-eye , but there’s nothing in the lexicon that starts υμελ- apart from an obscure word ὑμέλαι. That appears to mean “barren” — but it should be anglicized as _hymelops_ , since it’s written with an aspirant.

Ichios doesn’t show up either, there are no words starting ιχι- There are a lot of compounds of ἰχνεύω, a verb for seeking or hunting, and ἰχθύς, “fish” — but neither would start with _ichi-_
