Actually the oldest records are incredibly mundane: even before real writing there was a long period in which people used simple pictograms and tallymarks for elementary recordkeeping.

The oldest of these we can more or less “read” is probably the Kushim tablet:

This is from the city of Uruk, in modern Iraq; it’s from roughly 3100 BC. It says

> 29,086 measures barley 37 months. Kushim

We don’t know who or what “Kushim” is — it might be the title of an personal name, an official title, or a temple name — in those days, Sumerian temples acted kind of like a Soviet collective, stocking and redistributing commodities.

In any case, this item is essentially the world’s oldest receipt.
