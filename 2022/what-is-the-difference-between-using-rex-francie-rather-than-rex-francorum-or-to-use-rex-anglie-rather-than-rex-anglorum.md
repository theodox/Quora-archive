The territorial titles (which were more likely to be written with _Franciae_ and _Angliae_  ) appear to come later.

It’s hard to know if this is just an accident of the sources or had some other meaning, but you certainly see the ethnic phrasing in much older Latin sources; for example in his autobiography Augustus says this:

> Ad me supplices confugerunt reges Parthorum Tiridates et postea Phrates regis Phratis filius, Medorum Artavasdes, Adiabenorum Artaxares, Britannorum Dumnobellaunus et Tincommius, Sugambrorum Maelo, Marcomannorum Sueborum Segimerus.

> To me there came as suppliants the kings of the Parthians, Tiridates and later Phrates son of king Phrates; Artavasdes of the Medes, Artaxares of the Adieabenians, Bumnobellaunus and Tincommius of the Britons, Maelo of the Sugambrians, [and] Segimerius of the Suebian Marcomanni.

In general, Latin prefers _king-of-the-so-and-sos_  to _king of somewhere_ until the middle of the Middle Ages. The _rex Francorum_  didn’t start to be officially described as _rex Franciae_ until [Phillip II Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_France) around 1190, while the _rex Anglorum_  became the _rex Angliae_ under [Henry II ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England)in 1154 — though in both cases the older version remained in use alongside the newer, territorial version. It might be related to the complicated and mutually intertwined web of dynastic claims that made Henry and Philip’s nominal “kingdoms” overlap so much.

A lot of sources - including Wikipedia - claim that [Odoacar](http:// ) use the title _Rex Italiae_  as far back as 476. However the only use is by an African bishop, [Victor of Vita ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Vitensis)— not an actual subject; Gregory of Tours, a little later, uses the same phrase of [Theodoric the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodoric_the_Great) under similar circumstances. But Theodoric definitely used _Rex Gothorum_  of himself.
