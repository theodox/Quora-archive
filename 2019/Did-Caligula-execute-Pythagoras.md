The mathematician? Nope — he was about five centuries too late for that.

A closer match (though still not executed by Caligula) is an imperial freedman named [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_(freedman)#Marriage_to_Nero), whom Nero married:

> ...he stooped to marry himself to one of that filthy herd, by name Pythagoras, with all the forms of regular wedlock. The bridal veil was put over the emperor; people saw the witnesses of the ceremony, the wedding dower, the couch and the nuptial torches; everything in a word was plainly visible, which, even when a woman weds darkness hides.

[Tacitus 11.15](http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/annals.11.xv.html)

That one’s too late for Caligula, who died 23 years before. We don’t know what happened to that Pythagoras after Nero’s death, but given the unhappy fate of Nero’s _other_  freedman/spouse [Sporus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporus)* it would be rather surprising if he lived to a happy old age.



* Pythagoras was Nero’s _husband_ , Sporus his _wife._
