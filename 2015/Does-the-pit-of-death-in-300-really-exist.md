Sort of . 

The physical details in the movie are made up, but the original sources do tell basically the same story. In Herodotus (the closest to the original events), book 7:



> ... earlier Darius had sent heralds on this same mission, and when they made the demand, the Athenians threw them into a pit and the Spartans cast them into a well, bidding them carry earth and water to the king from there. 


The movie messes up by not drawing the distinction between Persian emperor Darius in the original and emperor Xerxes who actually followed up with the invasion depicted in the movie.

Killing ambassadors was a big no-no in ancient Greece (see [How much were the rules for not killing messengers adhered to in olden times?](https://www.quora.com/How-much-were-the-rules-for-not-killing-messengers-adhered-to-in-olden-times) ) The Persian envoy alludes to this in the movie) and later the Spartans believed that they had been cursed for this breach of international law:



> On the Lacedaemonians, however, the wrath of Talthybius, Agamemnon's herald, fell with violence. Talthybius has a temple at Sparta; and his descendants, who are called Talthybiadae, still live there, and have the privilege of being the only persons who discharge the office of herald. When therefore the Spartans had done the deed of which we speak, the victims at their sacrifices failed to give good tokens; and this failure lasted for a very long time. Then the Spartans were troubled; and, regarding what had befallen them as a grievous calamity, they held frequent assemblies of the people, and made proclamation through the town, "Was any Lacedaemonian willing to give his life for Sparta?" Upon this two Spartans, Sperthias, the son Aneristus, and Bulis, the son of Nicolaus, both men of noble birth, and among the wealthiest in the place, came forward and freely offered themselves as an atonement to Xerxes for the heralds of Darius slain at Sparta. So the Spartans sent them away to the Medes to undergo death.


Xerxes however didn't put the men to death when they arrived - it's not clear if he left them alive out of decency or because he thought the curse would linger.

Some modern readers think Herodotus' "well" is a deep chasm on the slopes of Mt. Taygetus, where Spartans are said to have left unwanted infants out to die (modern archaeologists have not found a lot of remains there, so it's not clear if the spot is wrongly identified or if the Spartans didn't practice infanticide as often as we thought). The location, known as the Caiadas (or "throw down" does have several skeletons of adult males.
