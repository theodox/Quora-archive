From a purely _Guns, Germs and Steel_ perspective things would look pretty much the way they did in our timeline. The epidemiological consequences would still be the same: many millenia of isolation from the rest of the world put the inhabitants of the Americas in a terrible position from which 16th century medicine (nor 17th, or 18th, or much of 19th) couldn’t save them.

On the purely technological front, the Aztecs were at an irreparable disadvantage — considered just as military conflict the standoff would also be very lopsided. The Spanish eventually conquered the Aztec empire with less than two thousand men; an Aztec force that somehow crossed the ocean in 1442 would have confronted a Europe of millions.

Of course, part of the reason the Spanish were able to defeat the Aztecs was that they had local help — there were only 2000 conquistadores, but they were allied with 200,000 Tlaxcalans who hated the Aztecs. It’s not impossible that an Aztec arriving in Europe could have figured out how to navigate the rivalries of Europe as well as the Spanish learned to manipulate local tensions in Mexico.

The mid 15th century wasn’t one of the most contentious times in European history, but it was hardly an era of universal solidarity. The [Italian Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Wars), which were a kind of dress rehearsal for the pan-European wars of the Reformation and the Early Modern era, were just over the horizon (they began in earnest in 1494, just after Columbus). These conflicts involved a dizzying collection of conflicting forces from Scotland to Syria, and an astute (or lucky) Aztec diplomat might have been able to concoct an alliance which protected them from whichever Europeans seemed the most threatening.

It would still be _extremely_  difficult for the Americans to manage their contact with Europe: between technology and microbes everything was against them. However, with the advantage of first contact (and, perhaps, being smarter about displaying their stocks of gold in front of greed-crazed Europeans) the inhabitants of the Americas might have retained more independence . They would probably have seen the kind of small-scale, localized conquest that characterized European colonialism around the Indian Ocean and the Java Sea, but possibly less of the wholesale occupation that marked the historic Spanish conquest.
