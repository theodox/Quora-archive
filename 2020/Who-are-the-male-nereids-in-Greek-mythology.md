There arenâ€™t really any â€” the Nereids are the _daughters_  of [Nereus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nereus)and [Doris.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_(mythology)) They arenâ€™t a species, they are just a (rather large) family.

The most common male sea-spirits youâ€™d find in Greco-Roman art as counterparts to the Nereids are the [Tritons](https://www.theoi.com/Pontios/Tritones.html#:~:text=THE%20TRITONES%20(Tritons)%20were%20a,(Satyrs)%20of%20the%20sea.)
