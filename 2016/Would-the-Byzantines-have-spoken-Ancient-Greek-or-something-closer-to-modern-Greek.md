Byzantine Greek is the late form of [Koine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek) , the 'common' Greek of the Hellenistic world. The [old Greek dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_dialects) gradually melded together as the Greek population spread out. Non-Greek habits also subtly affected the constructions and rhythms of the language -- particularly as the Orthodox Byzantines made really extensive use of the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint) , the Greek translation of the Old Testament done by Alexandrian Jews in the 3rd century BC. 

However, throughout Greek history -- before, during, and after Byzantine times -- there have been revival movements which prized the 'pure' Attic Greek of classical Athens. Byzantine literature was always tightly coupled with classical models but popular speech and demotic literature were less rigidly classical. Byzantines (the educated ones, anyway) never lost literary touch with the ancient models. One of the reasons we know the ancient Athenians so well is the obsessive Byzantine concern with the authors they cared most about.
