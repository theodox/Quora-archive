Original question: __Were the Minnesota Vikings North America's first slave owners?__

Assuming this is a serious question, the answer is “almost certainly no”, though our evidence is pretty poor.

Its true that Vikings everywhere were [enthusiastic slavers](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/12/151228-vikings-slaves-thralls-norse-scandinavia-archaeology/): the Norse trade networks all dealt in slaves, as abundantly shown by the popularity of Arab and Persian coins in Scandinavian finds. However there’s no widely accepted evidence for Norse settlement in the middle of the continent. The only undisputed Norse settlement ever found in North America is at [L'Anse aux Meadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Anse_aux_Meadows) in Newfoundland, more than 2000 miles from Minnesota. Most artifact finds west of their are questionable, like the so-called [Kensington Runestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Runestone) which has been regarded as hoax for over a century.

Slavery in many different guises was found all over the Americas.

We don’t have a lot of good evidence for the long-term history of New World slavery because of the lack of written records. However slavery was widespread in post-contact but pre-colonial times in most of North and Central America — cultures as different and distant from each other as the Haida in the northwest, the Algonquians in the northeast, and above all the Aztecs all practiced slavery — the last on an industrial scale.

It seems very unlikely that the practice of slavery — which, after all, was extremely common over the rest of the inhabited world — spread entirely from that one Viking toehold in North America so quickly.
