I'm not aware of any Google-translate like source for ancient Greek but I'm not surprised, for two reasons.

First, most machine translations nowadays make very heavy use of human-supplied translations: they collect actual, human made translations from all over the web and find statistically plausible matches. For living languages with lots of source data the results are very impressive -- but they depend on the existence of millions of examples to analyze. Try typing unusual, archaic or highly technical phrases into Google Translate and the results fall off fast -- the quality depends on the amount of source data they have to work with, which will be very small for ancient languages.

Second, there is very little _new_  material in any ancient language (there's always a trickle of new archaeological finds, but it's just a trickle). So there are good human translations of pretty much anything you'll want to read - the main exception being things like fragmentary inscriptions which are incomplete and often subject to a lot of debate. So the need is pretty low:.

If you want to see a translated text you can find the core of the ancient Greek corpus at [Perseus Digital Library](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/) with both Greek and English and [The digital Loeb Classical Library](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/loeb/digital.html) which provides them side by side.
