It depends a bit on how you mean it:

_resurgo_ , I rise again

_resurgat_ , he/she/it rises again

_resurge!_ Rise again! as a command

_resurgere_ to rise again (infinitive)

Not surprisingly this is the root word for _resurrect_  in English. All the possible grammatical options (past, present, future, active, passive, etc) [here](http://www.verbix.com/webverbix/go.php?D1=9&H1=109&T1=resurgo)
