It’s not always what we would call a name.

Most non-Romans got a Roman name when they became citizens, and traditionally the name would be the name of your Roman sponsor or patron. If you got your citizenship through the good offices of an individual, you’d typically take their name as your _nomen,_ the Roman clan name_._ So, for example, the Greek writer Plutarch became _Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus_ because his citizenship was sponsored by his friend Lucius Mestrius Florus.

Emperors, or course, were able to grant citizenship on a massive scale, to whole cities or regions. It’s usually easy to figure out when a provincial family became citizens because they’ll have an imperial _nomen._ Gaul, for example, had a lot of _Julii_ because many of the important families got citizenship from Julius Caesar or Augustus. Britain, likewise, had a lot of _Claudii_  thanks to Claudius.

A Flavian nomen, naturally, originates with the Flavian dynasty: the unfortunate Jewish historian we know as [Josephus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus)was actually _Titus Flavius Josephus_ to his Latin captors.

_An early Flavius: Titus Flavius Damianus, a second century Greek from Ephesus. His family will have gotten citizenship about two generations earlier, probably from Vespasian or Titus. In Greek, however, he’s univerally just “Damianus”, the “Titus Flavius” was purely for Roman legal and prestige purposes.

However “Flavius” — unlike the other imperial nomina — had a second go-round in the later empire. [Constantius Chlorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantius_Chlorus), the father of Constantine and the founder of what we call the Constantinian Dynasty, used several different names but generally went by __Flavius__ Julius Constantinus or (more often) __Flavius__ Valerius Constantius.

Now, to a Roman of the early empire this would seem weird, since “Flavius” ought to be a clan name not a _praenomen —_ you’d expect a something like boring old “Lucius,” “Gaius” or “Marcus” in the first position, with Flavius in the second. But in Chlorus’ late fourth century the traditional Roman naming system was breaking down. Old Roman first names fell out of use altogether. The old clan _nomen_  sometimes disappeared and sometimes shifted into the first position.

In ordinary life, however, the first element was mostly ignored because these were highly redundant: after[ Caracalla’s edict granting citizenship to all free-born residents of the empire](https://www.ostia-antica.org/caracalla/laws/constitutio.htm) in 212, the name Aurelius became ubiquitous, since he was officially “Marcus Aurelius Severus Antoninus Pius”. About half of Latinized Greek names and a third of Latin names from the fourth century are _Aurelius Somebody-or-other —_ which rendered Aurelius pretty useless as an identifier. Add in all the _Julii_ and _Claudii_  and so on and probably three out of every four Romans everywhere shared half a dozen “first” names.

Since the Flavian dynasty was not that long-lived — only 27 years — _Flavius_ was one of the less common imperial quasi-names when Constantius and his clan rose to power. The Constantinian dynasty liked to pretend that the Flavius in its names indicated a family relationship to the Flavian dynasty of Vespasian. This is almost certainly untrue: the first known ancestor of the clan was a Flavius Dalmatius, a name which sounds appropriate to a first-century Roman auxiliary who got his citizenship under Domitian.

Be that as it may, however, during the long reign of the Constantinian clan “Flavius” became a mark of social distinction, a way of standing out from all those generic Aurelii. The name is especially common among bureaucrats, officers , and local gentry — so much so that in Roman Egypt, anyway, [Flavius and Aurelius became automatic status markers,](https://ecommons.luc.edu/classicalstudies_facpubs/6/) pre-filled into paperwork. Aurelius was essentially “mr.” where Flavius was more like “rt. Hon” — and, naturally, neither was something you’d actually answer to.

Another reason for the Flavian boom is the need for Roman-sounding names was the influx of Germanic and Iranic warriors who formed the leadership caste of the late-Roman army. The army and the military-industrial complex produced a _lot_ of Flavii: most late antique heavy-hitters — power brokers like Aetiius, Stilicho, Ardabur, Aspar, Ricimer, Gundobad and Theodoric the Ostrogoth were all technically “Flavii” — but if you called out “hey Flavius!” in the imperial HQ at Ravenna or Arelate none of them would have looked up.

It really best to think of a post-Constantinian Flavius as an honoric, rather than a proper name. In the later empire “real” Romans — mostly, western aristocrats with long family memories — tended to stick with jumbles of purely Roman gentilic names: the nostalgic Gallo-Roman bishop [Sidonius Appollinaris](https://fsspx.news/en/news-events/news/fifteen-centuries-ago-saga-st-sidonius-apollinaris-63340) lived under the rule of the Visigoths but still went by the very old-fashioned Caius Sollius Modestus Apollinarius Sidonius. For the more practical apparatchiks of the late-Roman state, however, a “Flavius” remained as sought after as an OBE. The Aurelius-Flavius convention survived through the first half-century after the Arab conquest in Egypt, and remained an imperial “name” down to Justinian II. Even the very un-Roman Lombard invader, [Authari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authari), adopted a Flavius for his Latin titles:

> On account of his dignity they called him Flavius, a forename which all the kings of the Lombards who followed him used auspiciously.​
