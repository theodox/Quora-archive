Before around 100 BC, the legions were conscripts: the armies of the early and middle Republic were essentially just a citizen militia.

The [military reforms of Gaius Marius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_reforms) created the a professional, long-service military, the force which completed the conquest of the Mediterranean and defended the empire up until around the middle of the third century. The legionary component of that army were all paid professionals — however the armies of this period were only about 50% legionary. The rest of the men under arms were [auxilia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxilia)— non-citizens who were essentially “loaned” to Rome by a variety of Roman client states and allies. We don’t know nearly enough about the conditions under which these troops were recruited but the evidence suggests there were several different routes, ranging from what was basically mercenary work to tribal levies to the royal armies of various client kings.

Around the middle of the third century the Roman world entered a protracted crisis — a combination of increased pressure from barbarian neighbors and political infighting between different factions within the military. This lasted for nearly half a century, and it more or less trashed the army of the early empire.

After around 285 the army split into three distinct ‘levels’. At the top were the imperial household troops, the _[palatini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatini_(Roman_military))_ or _[scholastici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholae)_ — these were elite professionals who accompanied the emperor (or emperors — during much of the fourth century the empire was run by a two colleagues, east and west, each of whom had a second-in-command / successor). The line field armies were known as _[comitatenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comitatenses)_ __ (this is the ultimate origin of the English title “count”, via _comes,_ a field officer). The comitatenses were kept behind the frontiers as a mobile reserve; they were more or less the Late Roman counterparts to the traditional legions. Finally — accounting for at least half the total manpower — came the _[limitanei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitanei)_ , who were basically garrison troops who manned the frontiers. They had a lower standard of training and equipment and often lived a quasi-civilian life (they might, for example, be part-time farmers or tradesmen when things were quiet). Over the fifth century they came to resemble a local militia more than a regular military unit. This was also a period when the Roman state, increasingly short of cash, was tying many people to hereditary professions: in many areas the limitanei became a kind of local caste whose military obligations were hereditary. During the same period barbarian recruits formed a constantly increasing portion of the professional military, either as recruits or serving as mercenaries who replaced the old _auxilia._ 

So: in the early Republic and again in the twilight of the empire (in the west, anyway) the Roman military had a strong militia component. However in the heyday of Roman military power, roughly 100 BC to 300 AD, the empire’s defenses were primarily in the hands of professionals.
