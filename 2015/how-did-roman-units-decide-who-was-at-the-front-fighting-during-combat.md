In the classical three line formation - the _aes triplex_  -- the rotation of lines was made easier by the _quincunx,_ the "checkerboard" formation:

Since each of the three lines was arranged in the gaps of the line ahead, it was comparatively for Roman armies to swap ranks because they didn't have to interrupt the close manipular formations and make them vulnerable. (the gaps also gave the skirmishers, the _velites,_ enough room to withdraw without disrupting the formation when cavalry or heavy infantry pushed them back on the main line).

We're not sure how commands were relayed to tactical subdivisions of the cohort: Standards and signalling flags, horns (every cohort had a _cornicen_ or horn-blower) and voice commands were all used. There's no literary evidence for the whistles that showed up in the TV series _Rome_ , archeologists have found more than a few bronze whistles:

and the standardization of the types suggests they might be some kind of GI-issue standard item rather than just a toy.
