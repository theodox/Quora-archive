The [Kingdom of Aksum,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum) which included parts of modern Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan and briefly bits of the Arabian Peninsula as well. Aksum adopted Christianity officially under King [Ezana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezana_of_Axum) around the year 330. As such, the kingdom adopted Christianity before the Roman empire, and was the second country ever to do so (after Armenia).

The oldest illuminated Gospel manuscript in the world (not the oldest text, but the oldest illustrated versions) are the Aksumite [Garima Gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garima_Gospels); the older parts may go back as far as around the year 390.
