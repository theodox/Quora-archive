TL;DR: It's extremely hard to give a number, for a lot of reasons. A generous count could probably run into the thousands , and even a very strict one would be in the hundreds.

The number you will usually hear is 12:


Zeus

Poseidon

Hestia

Hera

Ares

Aphrodite

Apollo

Artemis

Hermes

Athena

Hephaistos

Dionysos

Demeter

You'll notice that's 13 names, because the traditional catalogues disagree about whether Hestia (the goddess of the hearth and home) or Demeter (the harvest) is to be included in the Olympian catalogue. Another familiar one, Hades (the Underworld) is not included in the "Olympian" 12 because he does not reside with the others on Mt. Olympos, but keeps to himself in the underworld. This list isn't complete -- it is, however, the one that all ancient authors agreed on. There's a host of lesser deities with local scope that might only be connected with local traditions, but the Olympians are essentially common to all Greek cities. There are also several well known deities who were pretty universally known but aren't part of the Olympian cadre -- Pan (nature), Gaea ('mother Earth'), Hecate (witchcraft and magic), the 3 Fates, the 9 Muses and so on -- who were more or less universal but rarely showed up as part of civic religion. 

Among those 14, there are some distinct groupings which are thought to reflect historical migration patterns and the melding of different local traditions. The "Children of Kronos" -- Demeter, Hestia, Hera, Hades, Poseidon and Zeus -- are all related mythologically (this image shows something of how complex this was, and there are many alternate versions, for reasons I'll go into below).

The children of Kronos are thought to be the ancestral gods brought by the first Greek speakers when they settled in their eventual home. Poseidon, for example, may originally have been a patron of horses rather than the sea, who got 'reassigned' when the proto-Greeks settled down by the Mediterranean -- although this is [disputed](http://disputed). 

Some of the other Olympians are clearly importations from other areas: Apollo and Artemis, for example, are mythologised as late additions (born to a human mother with Zeus as father). The worship of Apollo is thought to originate in Asia Minor and to have come into the Greek world around the 8th C BC, spreading first to the Delos (where Greeks later placed his birthplace) and thence the Delphi; Artemis may have been an importation of the "Great Mother", a common cult in Western Asia minor; later on she merged back in to that tradition in the form of the [Artemis of Ephesus](http://www.livius.org/religion/artemis-of-ephesus/), who shows up in the New Testament as "Diana of the Ephesians". This also illustrates why it's not really possible to give an accurate count: the habit of sharing names between wildly traditions makes it hard to decide what's what: apparently somebody though that Artemis -- the girlish, perpetually virgin goddess of hunting and solitude -- was "identical" to the Great Mother who presided over fertility. How or why that identification became common is unclear, but that kind of habit makes accurate counts impossible.

 [Dionysus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysian_Mysteries). the god of wine, is literally "The god from Nysa", and many legends record his arrival in the Greek world and how it disrupted traditional social order (the cult was always a favorite with social outcasts, women, and slaves -- the same groups who formed the core of early Christian communities; not surprisingly a lot of early Christian art includes Dionysiac themes, particularly grape vines). There is no record of or scholarly agreement on where he came from, however, some sources imply it was Thrace, some the East, and some associate him with [Ethiopia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nysa_%28mythology%29) or India. His cult probably arrived in Mycenaean times (before 1100 BC). He may be the only Black Greek god (although that was not a common artistic representation). 

Hermes appears to be indigenous to Greece, and may be one of the local deities who were superceded by the Olympians. He's associated with Arcadia, which was an underpopulated rural area where many pre-Hellenic traditions survived; his character as a trickster may have some bearing on how the local population had to deal with their new overlords. 

Hephaistos is a son of Hera, so he might be a proto-Greek god, although he might be associated with more advanced metalworking culture of Minoan Crete. He's probably attested in Mycenaean era sources.

Demeter and her daughter Persephone (not an Olympian, because she's doomed to spend half the year with Hades) are believed to be pre-Greek survivals associated with the annual cycle of the seasons. Demeter overlaps with Gaia and may be another case of two names for the same tradition, although in historic times Gaea was more directly identified with the physical earth and Demeter with the agricultural cycle. 

Athena is a daughter of Zeus and a minor goddess (_Metis,_ or "wisdom"). She might be an imported version of a Minoan goddess (name unknown), or perhaps an original pre-Greek goddess local to Athens; she's more closely tied to Athens than the other gods are to individual cities and Athens was unusually for having traditional connections to Crete (the Theseus stories) and to the pre-Greek population. By historic times (say, 900 BC) she's thoroughly Greek-ified. 

Aphrodite is a mysterious addition; the story of her spontaneous birth from sea foam probably suggests that she was imported by foreign traders. She's particularly associated with Cyprus, which makes it likely that she is ultimately related to the Phoenician goddess Astarte. There were two very different versions of Aphrodite current in historic times, _Aphrodite Pandemos_ , the goddess of physical love, and _Aphrodite Ourania_ , the "celestial" goddess associated with the planet Venus, copper, astrology and ecstatic union with the divine -- another example of one name for two goddesses.

Ares, the god of war, is an interesting case. There may be an alternative war god, Enyalios, or that may be an alternative name for the same deity (most gods had several nicknames, which may be ritual terms or which might reflect multiple local traditions being fused into one. Hades, for example, was also _Plouton_  (Pluto) "the wealthy one"). Despite being one of the Olympians, Ares is not prominent in Greek myths -- he often comes off as a braggart and even a coward, and he backs the losing side in the Trojan War. (This might reflect Athenian bias in the sources: in Sparta, Ares had a much higher reputation). Ares is associated with Thrace, but doesn't seem like an import: his name is an abstract noun : "Ruin", and his associated minor gods like _Deimos_ ("Terror") and _Phoibos_ ("Panic") are as well. That may make him a late abstract god, like _Harmonia_  (Harmony) and _Ereine (_ Peace).

Which raises an important point about the count: It's hard to tell how to interpret the Greek habit of deifying abstractions. I've already mentioned Wisdom, Terror, Fear, and Harmony, and there were dozens if not hundreds of these abstract deities. It's not clear which were allegorical fictions (and known to be so) and which were literally worshipped -- or whether there was really a difference. Examples of these include the 9 Muses, the 3 Graces, the 5 daughters of Aesclepius and so on. It's also hard to tell when these are nicknames for well known deities: Apollo is the sun -- but so is Helios -- are they synonyms or not? _Thanatos,_ "Death", might be Hades - or might not. So this complicates the counting enormously, particularly in the Hellenistic periods when poets and orators developed a positive fetish for personifications, allegories, and the occasional whole-cloth invention of a supposedly "ancient" tradition.

There are an extremely large, but undefined number of minor gods, goddesses and spirits as well; any big natural feature or human activity had a presiding deity, from _Ea_  (Dawn) to the 4 winds to hundreds of rivers, springs and vales. Some of these are remnants of ancient local traditions or pre-Greek religions, while some are just self-conscious poetic fictions -- but it's very hard for us to tell.

Finally, there's also the whole question of heroes: who received divine honors but were not immortals by birth. There were many of these, most of them very local to a particular city. Some were historical or semi-historical characters; the founders of cities like Cadmus and Theseus, for example. Some seem to be local pre-Greek gods who got demoted: Orestes, the hero of Tegea, seems to have been a pre-Greek god concerned with ironwork. Some could be invented retroactively as a way of symbolizing a political or social compact. And some made it to the big leagues and became gods: most famously Herakles -- who started off as a legendary ancestor of the Dorian tribes of southern Greece, but eventually was worshipped as commonly as the Olympians. This may be further complicated by the fact that we was commonly associated with the Phoenician war-god Melkarth, so his increased prestige might not even be entirely a Greek thing. The heroes are usually regarded as figures of the 'Greek dark age' later than Mycenae and younger than recorded history, say 1200 - 800 BC -- but some are clearly much older and a few, such as [Battus](http://Battus), are from recorded times. 

If that's not enough - well, there are dozens of non-Greek deities who were imported by immigrants, traders, or the spiritually curious. From Zalmoxis (and probably Orpheus too) to well known foreign deities like Cybele (Asia Minor), Oannes (Babylon), Isis and Osiris. These spawned new hybrid deities like [Serapis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapis), who was more or less designed as a kind of Greek-Egyptian crossover god to help the Ptolemies rule Egypt. Syncretisms of this kind started as early as the 6th century BC or so, and picked up speed enormously between the time of Alexander and the twilight of Greek paganism in the 4th or 5th century. They were especially common in Egypt, Asia Minor, and Greek-ruled Syria but they spread throughout the Greek world.

So, that's a very long answer but it all boils down to "you can't count them all" -- between the different meanings attached to different names, the numbers of synonyms, the huge number of lesser gods and local heroes, and the fuzzy line between real deities and allegorical personifications, the count is almost entirely based on your definitions.

.. oh, and that's not counting all the Hellenistic kings who demanded to be worshipped as gods too. As for how seriously anyone took that - well, it's tough to tell.
