There were Greek slave revolts, though none of them ever managed to secure a movie deal. The Greek writer [Athenaeus](http://www.attalus.org/old/athenaeus6d.html#265) had this to say:

> And it has been frequently shown by facts, that a slave is an objectionable and perilous possession; especially in the frequent revolts of the Messenians

His Messenians were the inhabitants of the western Peloponnessus: they were technically Helots, [more like serfs than slaves](https://www.quora.com/How-long-did-the-Spartans-have-slaves/answer/Steve-Theodore) , but they were famously resistant to their Spartan masters and revolted openly twice: once in 660 BC and again in 464 — the second being a revolt which shook the Spartan state to its core. During the Peloponessian War the Athenians supported Messenian rebels against the Spartans; the Spartans returned the favor by helping Athenian slaves to escape from Attica.

Athenaeus also tells a revolt story that’s interesting on a number of levels: [Drimakos](http://www.attalus.org/old/athenaeus6d.html#265), an escaped slave who eventually created a kind escaped-slave colony on the island of Chios. He successfully negotiated a tense coexistence with the Chians — they had to accept the independence of his band of escaped slaves and he, for his part, would limit his group’s banditry. He also promised to examine and future runaways and only accept those who had been unjustly treated by their masters. After his death he was worshipped as a “hero” — something like the patron saint of good master-slave relations.

A less picturesque example of an another successful rising claimed that the Greek city of Ephesus (famous from the New Testament) was founded by a thousand slaves who had revolted from their masters on the island of Samos.

A very interesting example was the career of [Eumenes III,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumenes_III) a pretender to the throne of Pergamon in Asia Minor. It wasn’t that uncommon for Greek cities or politicians to offer freedom to slaves as an inducement to military service in times of emergency. But Eumenes — fighting an unequal battle against the Romans — tried something different and more self-conscious. He tried to recruit slaves and the serf-like peasantry of Anatolian hinterland, and talked of creating a slave-free city to be called Heliopolis, or the City of the Sun.

This is a very rare example of what might actually be an ideological commitment to abolitionism: an idea that was otherwise basically unknown in antiquity. It’s probably significant that one of Eumenes’ closest advisors was [Gaius Blossius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Blossius), a Greek-Roman philosopher who had been the confidant of the murdered Roman reformer [Tiberius Gracchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Gracchus) and who seems to have been a true idealist. The exact balance between Jacobite and Jacobin in Eumenes’ movement, however, is hard to discern since we have so few sources. Unfortunately for Heliopolis, the Romans dispatched [Marcus Perperna,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Perperna_(consul_130_BC)) who had already distinguished himself as a general by defeating [a different slave rebellion in Roman Sicily.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Servile_War) Whatever his real motivations, Eumenes was strangled to death in the [Tullianum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamertine_Prison) in Rome without revealing them.

One striking thing to note is that the second century BC was really the “golden age” of slave revolts. It’s worth remembering that Spartacus’ war (in 75 BC) was actually known to the Romans as the _Third Servile War._ The other two were in Sicily, the first in 135 BC and the second in 104. Both of these had counterparts in the Greek world. The career of Eumenes followed right on the first Sicilian slave revolt and during the second there was a rising in the Athenian silver mines of Laurion, which led to widespread banditry in Attica.

Large scale warfare anywhere (particularly the wars which destroyed Carthage and Corinth in 146 BC) always produced large, sudden increases in the slave population. It may be that many of the slaves in the post-war eras were only recently enslaved and harder to cow; it may be that the glut of slaves (diminishing their sales price) led to harsher than usual treatment; or it may be that there were currents of resentment circulating in the slave communities that have left no trace in the sources. It is however remarkable how the years from 135 to 75 produced the largest and most visible — though far from the only — slave uprisings in Greek and Roman history.
