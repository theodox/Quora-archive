Not in the sense of being the original text — we have lots of older versions (mostly in Greek but also translations into Latin and Syriac).

However the Ethiopian [Garima Gospels](http://www.ethiopianheritagefund.org/complete-project-1-the-garima-gospels-in-context-new-copy) are usually cited as the oldest complete illuminated gospel manuscripts. There are older texts but none so amazingly intact. The older of the two Garima manuscripts was _probably_  written around 500 but the radiocarbon dating of the materials could push that back to just before 400.

Unfortunately these priceless books are in the path of the ongoing war in Ethiopia — their safety is far from guaranteed. More here :
