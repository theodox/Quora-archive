They shared a common enemy. The Spanish defeated Florence in 1512 ending Machiavelli’s political career and sending him to the torture chamber. The Spanish defeated [Túpac ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Túpac_Amaru)in 1572, allegedly in revenge for the murder of Spanish ambassadors by the Incas.

Ironically the Spanish viceroy of Peru, [Francisco de Toledo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_de_Toledo), was accused by his critics —even in Spain — of taking an amoral, “Machiavellian” approach to the Incas.
