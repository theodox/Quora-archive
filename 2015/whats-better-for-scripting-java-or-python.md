For scripting: Python, hands down. Java's dedication to explicitness makes it extremely clunky for rapid development.

If you're already good with Java, you could however try [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/), which is essentially a scripting language of the Python/Ruby variety but using Java syntax and running on the JVM.
