# How did Sumerian manage to survive as a ceremonial language in Mesopotamia for two thousand years after its last native speakers had vanished? Why was it withheld for so long unshaken by other more powerful languages like Persian, Greek, and Latin?

Basically no one used Sumerian for practical, day-to-day purposes after about the end of the third dynasty of Ur (say, 2000 BC). Sumerian was a prestigious dead language longer than it was a living one. It survived only as the language of religious practice, of law, and of scholarship. In that way it’s exactly like many other prestige languages: Biblical Hebrew, Sanskrit, or Coptic, for example, instead of active trade tongues like Greek or Aramaic. A language with the right connotations can have a long afterlife even if it has limited practical value.

__Hallowed associations__  are important in a lot of contexts. They confer emotional gravity and depth on ceremonial occasions. Plenty of Catholics, for example, associated Latin with an aura of sanctity even when they could not understand the words. And, to some degree, being incomprehensible is a plus here: Roman fortunetellers used faux-Etruscan when could no longer find anyone who spoke real Etruscan because it simply sounded more magical than plain everyday Latin.

Antiquity also means “__class__ ”: many colleges still hand out diplomas in Latin even though hardly any of their graduates can read them. The majestic looking text is simply a marker for the cultural connotations of “higher education,” even when the actual degree in question is in Media Studies or Tax Accounting. Antiquity is impressive as a stage prop: you can see this yourself by checking the volume of tattoo-related [Latin translation requests](https://www.quora.com/topic/Latin-language) in the Latin topic here on Quora.

Lastly, there’s an aspect of __social display__ . Mastery of incomprehensible ancient tongue is a luxury good, which only a few can afford. When Assyrian emperor [Ashurbanipal ](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-the-first-archaeologist/answer/Steve-Theodore)boasted that he knew “the dark Sumerian tongue, which few can learn aright,” a thousand years after the last ethnic Sumerian kingdom feel, he was — not to put it too bluntly — showing off. Your average Mesopotamia kinglet was too busy haggling over trade treaties or negotiating royal marriages to spend time puzzling out the proper use of an [enclitic copula](http://www.nytud.hu/archiv/eloadasok/zolyomi20160405.pdf)_,_ * but the King of the Universe** has the time, the smarts, and the expensive training necessary to read the hymns of [Enheduanna](https://www.ancient.eu/Enheduanna/) in the original.



* I have no idea what an enclitic copula is either, but it sounds impressive, right? _That’s_  _what I’m talking about._
