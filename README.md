# Steve Theodore's Quora Archive

This is a bulk conversion of the answers I've written at [Quora](https://quora.com) since 2014 -- a bit of insurance for all of the content I've accumulated over the years. It's been scraped using the [downloader I wrote](https://github.com/theodox/quoradl), which is freely available at Github.  The overwhelming bulk of this material is about ancient history, with a particular focus on Greek, Roman, and Mesopotamian topics. However there's more than a smidgen of other stuff as well.  

> Note: I've had to tweak it in the past to accomodate changes in Quora's undocumented internal JavaScript display code -- if you run into an issue, log it in the issue tracker in the repo!

These articles are currently not indexed or tagged or prettified; they are just an automated dump of the Quora content. At some point I'll try to provide some more semantic information convert them to a static-site-generator of some kind. If you're just interested in reading it might be easier to just jump to my [Quora Profile?](https://www.quora.com/profile/Steve-Theodore) instead of trying to read these on GitHub.
