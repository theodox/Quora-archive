Hm, that’s really odd. You can see it quite clearly in __Mέμνων__ or __πολυτρόπως.__ 

Looking at the web source, it looks like the editor div is named Answer Editor edit_latex web, maybe it is a quirk in LaTex which expects mu and pi to be math symbols? More likely, just a web font that isn’t very good…
