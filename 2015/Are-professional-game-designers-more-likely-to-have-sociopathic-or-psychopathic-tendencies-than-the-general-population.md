It's certainly true that one subset of successful designers are highly analytical and are inclined to view things from a systems perspective. I doubt that translates into sociopathy, however. Providing people with fun experiences depends on empathy and imagination as well as analytics: a good designer needs to combine an algorithmic understanding with a good intuition for what other people will enjoy.

One thing that does distinguish a lot of designers is a dash of cynicism. They also learn from experience how well people learn to 'game' any system. All developers have to deal with the fact that rule-makers can never win: players out number us a million to one (at least, if we're lucky) and have way more time to examine our little constructs for exploitable flaws and oversights. And (since we deal with players in the mass, not as individuals) we have to plan for the behavior of the aberrant minority if we want the ordinary users to have a good time: you don't work in games long before you discover what _user generated content_  really means in practice.

So: sociopaths? No, unless you're grinding out soulless F2P games with hyper-aggressive monetization -- that might actually be sociopathic. The only other example of designer-as-sociopath is their penchant for proposing sweeping changes at the last minute, inflicting lots of extra work on us poor content people.
