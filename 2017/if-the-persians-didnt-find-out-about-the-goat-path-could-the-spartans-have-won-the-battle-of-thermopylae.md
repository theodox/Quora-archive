Not really, no.

The position was strong but hardly impregnable: the wall across the field at Thermopylae was in such bad repair that the Spartans and their allies had to rebuild it by hand in the run-up to the battle. The success of the defenders on the first couple of days had more to do with Persian impatience than anything else.

The first day was a bit of a surprise for the Persians — they had fought Greek hoplites before, but the Spartans, unlike the Ionian Greeks, were well enough trained that they lured the Persian infantry in with feigned retreat, then caught them with a sudden about-face. This let them come to grips with the Persians on their own terms, where their heavier armor and longer spears were a significant advantage.

On the second day, the Persians got much the same treatment — but they learned from the mistake. Xerxes opted to look for a way around the obstacle. He wasn’t a fool to throw away lives for no reason. Once it became obvious that the defense was serious — and, with ample experience of Greek disunity in the past, Xerxes may have been surprised by such serious fighting without parley — he looked for an end run.

If he had not found one, though, he could always fall back on the long and successful Persian tradition of siege warfare, with roots going all the way back to the Assyrians. The Persians knew how to overcome the fortifications of large Greek cities (such as Miletus, which they destroyed at the end of the Ionian Revolt); a ramshackle wall with a small defense force would not have stopped them long. A more methodical approach would have benefitted from the Persians’ overwhelming superiority in archery.

In the frontal assaults, the Persians were playing by the Greeks’ rules — but in a slower battle of attrition they would have had all the advantages. It was really only impatience on the Great King’s part that made the battle as difficult as it turned out to be. The next year at [Plataea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plataea#Strategic_and_tactical_considerations) the Persians were more careful.

The Persians never really developed a tactic for defeating a well-led hoplite phalanx — but they didn’t have to. At Plataea there were several thousand hoplites from Thebes and the rest of northern Greece fighting for the Persians. After the invasion, the Great Kings would never again mount a campaign without a significant contingent of Greek heavy infantry, whether Ionian subjects or hired mercenaries.
