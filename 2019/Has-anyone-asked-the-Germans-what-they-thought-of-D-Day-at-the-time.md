[D-Day through German Eyes](https://amzn.to/2I32Dzw) by Holger Echertz is the result of a series of interviews with German veterans carried out in the post-war period. It’s a fascinating look at what it was like to be stuck on the beaches or trapped in a bunker when the invasion occurred.

It’s also a very interesting window into the way ordinary German draftees interpreted the events they had lived through — at the point in time when these interviews were done many of these guys were still processing the magnitude of what the war had really meant.
