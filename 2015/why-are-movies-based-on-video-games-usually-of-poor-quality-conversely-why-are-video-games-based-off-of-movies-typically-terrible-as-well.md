# Why are movies based on video games usually of poor quality? Conversely, why are video games based off of movies typically terrible, as well?

For the game side, the correlation is not perfect, but it's a generally recognized stereotype that's probably close enough for horseshoes.

There are several dimensions to how it works in games, but bascially:


A license is usually about lowering risks. Most games don't make back their money. There are no authoritative numbers, but industry people often say things like 8 or 9 out of 10 games don't make back their investments. 

I think that's too dire, but it gives you a sense of the business model: it's all about hits. License games are the main exception: a license is more like a commodity manufacturing contract: you can predict with some accuracy how well your Harry Potter or Star Wars game will do based on the name on the box without reference to metacritic, or gaming fads, or even code quality. If you build a license game you're aiming for a (relatively) safe, (relatively) predictable small success instead of the huge hit most studios crave. So, your incentive to innovate is much smaller and your need for passionately perfecting the game is much less.

Licenses are expensive. The license holder has the stronger negotiating positions (unless for some reason you're a famous game company making a game on an obscure license). So the licensee -- the game company -- has already spent a lot of money (or future money, that is royalties) before starting the game. This encourages them not to spend on fancy art, high-end code, or other expensive goodies. Sometimes the owner of the IP will demand things like using original assets or actors -- these can improve the quality of the presentation, but are usually very expensive. "Real" actors are extremely expensive compared to the usual game voice actor.

License game schedules are often dictated by things like movie release dates. This often means that games ship 'when time's up' instead of 'when they are done'

Some licensors are a pain to work with. They will try to micro-manage every creative decisions. This can slow development to a crawl, with lawyers and IP consultants getting their fingers into seemingly trivial elements of development. I don't know how they handle this sort of thing in Hollywood but it tends to drive game people _nuts._ It often drives passionate people away from license games, or grinds their enthusiasm down to dust.
