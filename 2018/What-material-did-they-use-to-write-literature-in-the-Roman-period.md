For ordinary note-taking or composition most people used wax tablets: a pair of hinged pieces of wood with a lining of wax that could by written on using a lead or wood stylus:

Plain wooden tablets, without the wax, could also be used for mundane purposes. The [Vindolanda tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda_tablets) are one of the very rare surviving examples.

A last tablet-based writing system used soft metal leaves and a harder stylus. Lead was the usual material for the leaves but copper was also used. These kinds of writing were more durable but also harder to work with, they were mostly reserved for writing that was intended to last. The most commonly found examples contain [curses](http://www.roman-artifacts.com/Miscellaneous%20Ancient%20Items/Lead%20Curse%20tablet/Lead%20curse%20tablet.htm).

One last writing medium was very informal: [ostraka](https://www.lib.umich.edu/papyrology-collection/ancient-writing-materials-ostraka) are basically potsherds. Since broken pottery was very common and cheap it was often used for unimportant note-taking. The writing could be done with a sharp stylus or a brush pen and ink. This was more common in the Greek east than the Latin-speaking west.

The primary writing material, particularly for long-form writing, was [papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus), a paper-like material made from the leaves of the Egyptian papyrus plant. Papyrus was used all over the empire, though most of our surviving examples come from the Middle East where the arid climate has preserved them.

Originally the papyrus was made in very long individual sheets and rolled onto scrolls:

Between the first and seventh centuries scrolls were gradually replaced by [codices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex) — basically modern hardcover books. One reason we don’t have many ancient scrolls is that codices are much more space-efficient and easy to store; when old works were recopied into codex form the bulkier old copies were discarded.

Both scrolls and codices could also be made with [parchment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchment), which is made from animal skins. Parchment was more common in areas where papyrus was hard to come by — it’s more durable but more expensive to produce.
