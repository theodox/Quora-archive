The [Python Cookbook](http://amzn.to/1Iimpyu) is a great resource for scripting/automation tasks because it's a good one-stop shop for anything from "how do I read a spreadsheet file" to "how do I send an email in Python" to "what are good ways to deal with large sets of data". 

It has basically zero theory or philosophy but it's a collection of the basic Pythonic approach to dozens of common tasks.

Another good book for the same purpose is [The Python Standard Library by Example](http://amzn.to/1T0MgO8)
