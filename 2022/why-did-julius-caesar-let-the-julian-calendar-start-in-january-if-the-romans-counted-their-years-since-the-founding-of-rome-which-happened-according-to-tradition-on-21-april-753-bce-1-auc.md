# Why did Julius Caesar let the Julian calendar start in January if the Romans counted their years since the founding of Rome, which happened, according to tradition, on 21 April 753 BCE = “-1” AUC?

The [AUC dating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_urbe_condita) was never very common with ordinary people — it was primarily a Roman answer to the Greek system of [Olympiad dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad). Both systems were used mainly to provide a common way to calibrate the many conflicting local calendars that were in use all over the Mediterranean world. The familiar date of 753 BC is [only one of several competing ones,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_of_Rome#Date) though most of them were fairly close

If you asked Caesar himself what year he proposed his calendrical reforms he would not have said _anno DCCVIII ab urbe condita,_ he’d have said _consulatu Caesaris Antonique,_ “in the consulate of Caesar and Antonius.” Under his breath Caesar, however, he have said _anno I Caesaris_ , “the first year of Caesar”, since he had just been appointed _dictator perpetuus_  and was almost certainly flirting with the idea of ruling as a king rather than an elected Roman official.

In very early times, the Roman year originally commenced in March — that’s why our ninth through twelfth months bear the Latin names _September, October, November, December,_ ie, “seventh month, eighth month, ninth month and 10th month.” But that first Roman calendar was widely known as [something of a mess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar#Prehistoric_lunar_calendar) , and even in pre-historic times it needed an overhaul. Roman tradition ascribes the first attempted fix to [Numa Pompilius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numa_Pompilius), the semi-legendary second king (reigned 38 to 81 AUC, six hundred years before Caesar).

All we know about Numa comes from much later, contradictory accounts. Most claimed that he inserted January and February into the calendar. Here’s the Roman poet Ovid imagining the origin of the Roman year

> When Rome’s founder established the calendar
He determined there’d be ten months in every year.
You knew more about swords than stars, Romulus, surely,
Since conquering neighbours was your chief concern!

> …

> When he decreed his year to an unsophisticated people,
Mars’ month, March, was the first, and Venus’ April second:
She was the mother of the race, and he its father.
The third month May took its name from the old (maiores),
The fourth, June, from the young (iuvenes), the rest were numbered.
But Numa did not neglect Janus and the ancestral shades,
And therefore added two months to the ancient ten.

[Ovid, Fasti I](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/OvidFastiBkOne.php#anchor_Toc69367257)

It was usually said to be Numa who shifted the start of the year to January, but this is probably incorrect. You’ll notice in the quote above that Ovid says Numa “added” January and February, which would make them the _last_ months and leave count from March intact. Mythologically Numa was a wise-elder figure responsible for teaching Romans the peaceful arts of civilization after the warlike rule of Romulus — so, Later Romans assumed it was he who moved the start of the year from _Martis_ , the month of Mars, to _Januarius_ , the month of Janus, god of boundaries and transitions.**

Whether it started with Numa or not, by Caesar’s time (a generation or so before Ovid’s) the start of the year was universally agreed to be January. Exactly why was less clear: Ovid, in the poem quoted above, actually asks the god Janus why the year doesn’t start in the March, when nature seems to be proclaiming new beginnings. Janus answers “‘Midwinter’s the first of the new sun, last of the old: / Phoebus and the year have the same inception.’” However this is actually a bit off: at least in our modern version of the calendar the winter solstice is on December 21, 10 days _before_ the start of January.

An alternative explanation is that the [habit of naming the years by the consuls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul#Consular_dating) had shifted people’s sense of the “new year” to the day when the consuls were inaugurated, which was January 1. This was a fairly late development. It started as a wartime emergency measure in 153 BC, but by Caesar’s day it had been standard for more than a century. If this year was “the year of consul X and consul Y” it only made sense to assume the year began an ended with the consuls’ term of office.

The Roman calendar that Caesar inherited was a mess, which needed constant tinkering to stay close to the solar year. Caesar, who was nothing if not practical, hired a couple of the best astronomers of the day (notably, [Sosigenes of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosigenes_of_Alexandria)) to establish a solar calendar that would keep the months aligned to the seasons.

Although the system was sound, it took decades to properly implement — although the Romans extended the last year of the old calendar to 445 days in order to establish the new alignment, Caesar’s assassination and the chaos which followed meant that it took decades for the new calendar to stabilize: Roman dates between 44 BC and 8 BC are difficult for modern historians to pin down and often require careful checking with Greek or other sources to verify. It’s entirely possible that Ovid had lived through a few January 1’s that fell on or near the winter solstice, since he finished his _[Fasti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasti_(poem))_ in 8 BC.

Caesar might have considered more radical changes to the calendar — after all it was his adoptive son and heir who changed the month _Quinitilis_  to _Julius_ in his honor. But the implications of interfering with the inauguration of the consuls would not be lost on his contemporaries: his enemies accused him of wanting to be a king instead of a proper Roman senator; interfering with an established politico-religious tradition in a disruptive way could only add weight to their suspicions.



** There’s a different tradition which puts the year-start change in the 450’s BC, at the time of the [Twelve Tables.](https://www.worldhistory.org/Twelve_Tables/#:~:text=The%20Twelve%20Tables%20(aka%20Law,be%20treated%20equally%20before%20them.)
