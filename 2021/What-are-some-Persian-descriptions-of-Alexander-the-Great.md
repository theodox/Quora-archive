There are a few, but none of them are remotely contemporary. The oldest surviving Persian mentions are from the 9th or 10th century — so thirteen hundred years after Alexander.
 
There are really two contradictory traditions about Alexander in Persian sources.

The first — found in Zoroastrian religious texts — is hostile. Here’s the [Book of Arda Viraf](http://www.avesta.org/mp/viraf.html), a religious commentary on the Zoroastrian Avestas:

> But afterward, the accursed evil spirit, the wicked one, in order to made men doubtful of this religion, instigated the accursed Alexander, the Roman, who was dwelling in Egypt, so that he came to the country of Iran with severe cruelty and war and devastation; he also slew the ruler of Iran, and destroyed the metropolis and empire, and made them desolate.

> And this religion, namely, all the Avesta and Zand, written upon prepared cow-skins, and with gold ink, was deposited in the archives, in Stakhar Papakan, and the hostility of the evil-destined, wicked Ashemok, the evil-doer, brought onward Alexander, the Roman, who was dwelling in Egypt, and he burned them up. And he killed several _Dasturs_  and judges and _Herbads_  and _Mobads_  and upholders of the religion, and the competent and wise of the country of Iran. And he cast hatred and strife, one with the other, amongst the nobles and householders of the country of Iran; and self-destroyed, he fled to hell.

_Arda Viraf_ as we have it probably dates to the 9th or 10th century. Some scholars believe it derives from a Sassanian period original.

In a similar vein the [Denkard](https://iranicaonline.org/articles/denkard) , a Mazdaean religious commentary, describes Alexander in similar terms:

> When king Alexander of evil fame came to the country of Iran, the divine faith was (a good deal) harmed. All the writings (preserved in) the Dez-i Napesht [= archives] were burnt. And other writings (which) were in the Ganj-i Shaspigan [= treasury] passed into the hands of the Arumans. (Alexander) had these translated into Greek.

> [Denkard 3.420](http://www.avesta.org/denkard/dk3s414.html#chap420)

Again, the text dates to the 9th century or so. The hostility toward Alexander’s memory is a common theme in later Zoroastrian texts as well. Generally however the historical element is not strong: these and later texts aren’t very good on the details of Achaemenid history. For example in _Arda Viraf_ , Alexander slays “the ruler of Iran”, though historically Darius III was killed by Bessus, a Persian general. In the _Denkard_ , Darius is “Darai, son of Darai” where in actuality, he was a great-grandson — there were three other kings between Darius II and Darius III. [Most scholars believe that there was no written historical tradition in Persian before the Sassanid era, and that these traditions reflect at least five hundred years of oral tradition and folk memory.](https://iranicaonline.org/articles/iran-iii-traditional-history)

Interestingly there is a different, much more positive tradition about Alexander in Persian too. However it’s not particularly accurate either.

At some point after the third century, the [Alexander Romance](https://oxfordre.com/classics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-8245) — a wildly popular but also highly fictionalized version of Alexander’s life and exploits — was adopted by Persian literary culture and acquired a Persian gloss. This tradition (under the broad name of “[Eskandar-nama](https://iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama)”) was a popular one everywhere that Persian culture extended.

_The murder of Dara (Darius) by his Viziers, from the more positive Persian Alexander tradition as recorded in the_ _[Shahnameh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh)_ _, a bit later than the Book of Arda Viraf.

In the popular [Shahnameh](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/thousand-years-of-the-persian-book/epic-of-shahnameh.html), for example, Alexander’s mother is a “Roman” princesss who married a Persian emperor (Dara or Darab) but was sent home to the west for her bad breath. When Alexander grew to manhood he returned to Persia and defeated his half brother (a second Darab). As Darab dies, he exacted a promise from Alexander to marry Darab’s daughter Rowšanak and to protect the Avestan religion (clearly, a complete contradiction of the story in the _Arda Viraf_ ). Alexander goes on to visit Mecca, tries and fails to find the the water of immortality, and visits China where he build the wall which holds back Gog and Magog. You can read Ferdowsi’s version [here](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Shah_Nameh/Sikander).

In a somewhat [later version of the Alexander story](https://iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama-of-nezami), however, Alexander is a pious monotheist who destroys the fire-temples of the Zoroastrians and seeks to convert the world to monotheism, along the way defeating the Amazons, the Kievan Rus, and the Ethiopians. Here’s he’s generally a wise philosopher king and his son Eskandarūs does not take up the kingdom after him, choosing instead to live as a holy hermit.

So: there were two very diametrically versions of Alexander circulating in Persia a thousand years ago or so. Unfortunately we don’t have much solid evidence before that — we can guess the hostile Zoroastrian tradition was circulating in the Sassanid period, since the Sassanids were for the most part patrons of Avestan religion. It’s possible that the pro-Alexander traditions are a late adoption, but they might instead have started circulating under the Parthians, who were on a much friendlier footing with Greek culture generally than their Sassanian successors. Unfortunately [the terrible dearth of first-hand Persian sources before the Sassanian period ](https://www.quora.com/It-seems-like-most-of-what-we-know-about-Achaemenid-Persia-comes-from-ancient-Greek-records-Why-are-the-Persians-own-records-so-sparse/answer/Steve-Theodore)means we are very unlikely to ever get a contemporary or near contemporary look at Alexander through the eyes of his opponents.
