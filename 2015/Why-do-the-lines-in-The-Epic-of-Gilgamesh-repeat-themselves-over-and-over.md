It's a common structure in many oral traditions, and in the case of the Semitic languages it's a general-purpose poetic device as well -- it's all over the Bible:



> The kings came and fought,
Then fought the kings of Kena'an,
In Ta'nakh by the waters of Megiddo;
They took no gain of silver.
They fought from heaven;
The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.
The wadi of Qishon swept them away,
The ancient brook, the brook of Qishon. (_Judges_  5.19-21)


As [User-10661484422791150723](https://www.quora.com/profile/User-10661484422791150723) points out, this is useful for a poet or reciter trying to remember an orally transmitted story, although it clearly survives as a literary device long after the invention of writing (the same is true of rhyme in English).
