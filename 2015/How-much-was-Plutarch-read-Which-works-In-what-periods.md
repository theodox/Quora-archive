We don't know much about his popularity in antiquity from direct evidence -- but the fact that so much of his work survives suggests he was a fairly popular author since the attrition rate was generally terrible and only works which circulated very widely tended to survive. He probably owes his survival to the combination of literary merit, Greek patriotism (his preservation was of course primarily thanks to Byzantine scholarship) and mellow moralizing that appealed to both Pagan and Christian readers down the centuries. 

Its' not hard to see why: Plutarch offers a very unique combination of literary ease, insightful characterization and a deceptively simple way of framing historical events which makes them feel very immediate. Combine that with the bite-size length of his most popular works (the _[Parallel Lives](http://www.britannica.com/topic/Parallel-Lives)_ [ ](http://www.britannica.com/topic/Parallel-Lives)) and it's a great recipe for popularity. Moreover he offers enough drama to entrap a student alongside enough moralizing to gratify the instincts of a schoolmaster, so he's eminently marketable as a commonplace of education. The Lives are always the most popular works, and the most widely quoted. 

We do know with certainty that Plutarch was one of the most widely read classical authors during the Renaissance. His dramatic characterizations were central to the plays of Shakespeare and Racine, while his political morality tales were important to thinkers as different as Machiavelli and Montaigne. 

In the Enlightenment his solemn evocation of Republican virtues and Greek political passions -- however airbrushed -- was deeply influential to (among many other quoters) Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and Thomas Jefferson. Rousseau's early education was pretty much entirely limited to exhaustive re-reading of Plutarch.

To quote [Ralph Waldo Emerson](http://www.rwe.org/complete-works/x---lectures-&-biographical-sketches/plutarch.html), writing in the 1870's:



> Plutarch occupies a unique place in literature as an encyclopaedia of Greek and Roman antiquity. Whatever is eminent in fact or in fiction, in opinion, in character, in institutions, in science - natural, moral, or metaphysical, or in memorable sayings, drew his attention and came to his pen with more or less fulness of record. He is, among prose writers, what Chaucer is among English poets, a repertory for those who want the story without searching for it at first hand, - a compend of all accepted traditions
