Caesar was more-or-less responsible for the accidental destruction of the Library of Alexandria, one of antiquity’s greatest collections of books.

It’s important to remember, though, that he had other more pressing problems at the time than thinking about cultural legacy: he and his troops were trapped in the waterfront districts of Alexandria, surrounded by a much more numerous enemy force and they were fighting house-to-house for several weeks. The library was burned down when an attack on the Roman position spread fire to a bunch of warehouses on the waterfront. This took large portions of the district with it.

The whole episode was regarded as deeply embarassing, you can see that Caesar’s successors didn’t like to talk about it and it didn’t become safe to talk about for around a hundred years after the event.

The Roman state did occasionally resort to book burning on a small scale — usually they were after books of prophecies or astrology, since those kinds of things were frequently implicated in political agitation. And Caesar definitely did make life uncomfortable for his critics, though there was no “press” to control in a world where all texts were hand copies. But he was not what we’d conventionally call a book burner.
