That seems to be the conclusion of [Everybodyâ€™s an Expert](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/12/05/everybodys-an-expert): on big questions, the predictive abilities of 'very smart' people aren't much better than those of average people (or, for that matter, than flipping coins!) but their defense of their mistakes is undoubtedly more eloquent and persuasive sounding.
