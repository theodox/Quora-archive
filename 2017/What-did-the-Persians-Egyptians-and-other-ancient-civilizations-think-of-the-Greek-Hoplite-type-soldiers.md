The Greeks were definitely [in demand in both Egypt and Persia as mercenaries.](https://stefanosskarmintzos.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/ancient-greek-mercenaries-in-antiquity/) They were the best heavy infantry of the day, and although their style of fighting wasn’t universally useful they were extremely hard for the lighter-armed infantry of Egypt and Persia to beat in a head-on fight.

Pharoah [Psamtik I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psamtik_I) founded the Greek colony of Naucratis around 650 BC, reputedly because he’d been warned by an oracle to look for “bronze men from the sea”:

> Psammetichus did not in the least believe that men of bronze would come to aid him. But after a short time, Ionians and Carians, voyaging for plunder, were forced to put in on the coast of [Egypt](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/entityvote?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=2:chapter=152:section=4&auth=tgn,7016833&n=1&type=place), where they disembarked in their armor of bronze; and an Egyptian came into the marsh country and brought news to Psammetichus (for he had never before seen armored men) that men of bronze had come from the sea and were foraging in the plain.

Greek hoplites fought on behalf of the Egyptians against Persia on and off for the next 300 years. We don’t have a lot of literary evidence beyond that quote from Herodotus, but we do see Egyptian resistance to Persia repeatedly seeking Greek infantry. Athenians and Spartans both fought for the rebel Pharoahs; the long history of military alliance has a lot to do with Egypt’s enthusiastic embrace of Alexander in 332.

Perhaps by osmosis from Egypt, the Judean king Josiah used [Greek mercenaries to staff his network of forts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesad_Hashavyahu) around 630 BC. Greek hoplites in Egyptian service fought the Babylonians at [Carchemish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carchemish) in 605 (hoplite equipment has been found on the battlefield), but its believed that there were Greek hoplites in the Babylonian army that overthrew Assyria. It also appears there were Greek hoplites fighting in the Levant in the 7th century BC.

It’s not surprising that the Greek poet Alcaeus wrote this for his brother, a mercenary home from the Near East some time after 600:

> You have returned from the ends of the earth, Antimenidas, with the gold-bound ivory hilt of that sword with which, as you fought for the Babylonians who dwell in houses of long bricks, you did a great deed, preserving them all from evil by killing a fighter who lacked only a palm of standing five royal cubits high.

The [extent of Greek mercenary involvement in the Levant, Egypt and even Mesopotamia](http://erenow.com/ancient/men-of-bronze-hoplite-warfare-in-ancient-greece/11.html) is testimony to the reputation of Greek heavy infantry in the ancient world. They weren’t hired for their skills as tragedians or philosophers.

The Persians came to Greek mercenaries rather later than their neighbors, but they were pretty quick to absorb the lessons of Thermopylae and Plataea. The Persian army was always a complex multi-ethnic assembly, but after the failed invasion of Greece the Persians began recruiting Greek mercenaries as well as levying subject contingents. Most famously, the core of Cyrus the Younger’s army at [Cunaxa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cunaxa) was a [10,000 strong Greek hoplite army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Thousand_(Greek_mercenaries)), which defeated a more conventional Persian army four times its number there.

Cyrus, however, was killed in the battle, leaving the Greeks adrift in the middle of the Persian empire. You can gauge something of the way Persians thought about Greek hoplites by reading the [Anabasis of Xenophon,](http://www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/History/hakhamaneshian/xenophon/anabasis/xeno_anbs_book_1.htm) which recounts how the mercenaries (leaderless and alone in hostile territory) managed to march 400 miles through the heart of Mesopotamia and Anatolia and emerge intact on the coasts of the Black Sea. One anecdote from the prelude to the battle gives a bit of the flavor:

> Cyrus inspected the Persians first, and they marched past with their cavalry formed in troops and their infantry in companies; then he inspected the Greeks, driving past them in a chariot, the Cilician queen in a carriage. And the Greeks all had helmets of bronze, crimson tunics, and greaves, and carried their shields uncovered. [1.2.17] When he had driven past them all, he halted his chariot in front of the centre of the phalanx, and sending his interpreter Pigres to the generals of the Greeks, gave orders that the troops should advance arms and the phalanx move forward in a body. The generals transmitted these orders to the soldiers, and when the trumpet sounded, they advanced arms and charged. And then, as they went on faster and faster, at length with a shout the troops broke into a run of their own accord, in the direction of the camp. [1.2.18] As for the Persians, they were terribly frightened; the Cilician queen took to flight in her carriage, and the people in the market1 left their wares behind and took to their heels; while the Greeks with a roar of laughter came up to their camp. Now the Cilician queen was filled with admiration at beholding the brilliant appearance and the order of the Greek army; and Cyrus was delighted to see the terror with which the Greeks inspired the Persians.

Unfortunately we have to take this on Xenophon’s word; we’ve got basically no written accounts from the Persian side for any of this.

We also don’t have much literary evidence from Carthage, but we do know that the Carthaginian military recruited Greek mercenaries when it could — even when [fighting against the Sicilian Greeks](http://www.heritage-history.com/?c=academy&s=war-dir&f=wars_sicilian). The Carthaginians also adopted hoplite tactics and equipment for their own citizen forces (although the citizen corp of their army was always a minority — mercenaries and allies from North Africa and Iberia formed the bulk of the forces).
