Greeks intermittently recognized that the city-state form of government didn’t work well for a lot of problems — particularly for collective security and trade relations. So they organized what we usually call “leagues” and what they called κοινα_, koina_  or “communities” to try to manage military, economic and usually religious cooperation among groups of cities.

Some of the the groups — for example the [Achaean League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaean_League#:~:text=The%20Achaean%20League%20(Greek%3A%20%CE%9A%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BD%E1%BD%B8%CE%BD,which%20formed%20its%20original%20core) — eventually turned into more or less effective federal governments. For the most part they were more like the modern [League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations) - talking shops designed to facilitate cooperation and collective security but without a lot of power to override local self-interest.

The Panionic league was the κοινὸν Ἰώνων, _koinon Iōnōn,_ the “community of the Ionians” — it was the collective that included the Ionian Greek cities of Asian Minor. At peak it included 13 cities, all located on or near the central part of the Aegean coast of Asia Minor.

There’s actually a degree of ambiguity about who really was “an Ionian” — the name today is used interchangeably for the eastern Greek dialect and for the people of Greek Asia Minor but in antiquity the boundaries more complex: Herodotus makes a few dismissive remarks about the lack of “purity” among the Ionians, who intermarried with other Greek groups and with people from Asia Minor. However he himself (born in Dorian Halicarnassus, not in any of the Ionian cities) neverthless wrote in Ionic dialect. As a group identity Ionians is an unstable hybrid of a dialect group, an ethnic or tribal group within the larger Greek community, and a geographical region that included plenty of non-Greeks even when it was dominated by Greek political institutions. Nevertheless the Ionians were the most visible face of “Greekness” in the east — the word _Ionian_ became the basis for local way of describing Greeks in Persian, Hebrew, Coptic and Hindi among other languages.

Like a lot of other Greek leagues, the Ionian League was nominally a _religious_ association. It’s physical manifestation was the [Panionion,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panionium) a common holy sitie which include temples, theaters, and grounds for athletic contests and festivals — essentially, the Ionian version of Olympia. It was located near Priene. The festival was both a religious ritual and a chance for the different cities to make deals and, occasionally, to act together as unit. The Ionian philosopher [Thales of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus) tried, unsuccessfully, to get the league cities to unite into a federal state with common decision making and common citizenship — unfortunately he failed, and political disunion ensured that for most of their history the Ionian cities were under the thumb of one outside power or another.

The league’s main effort at coherent political action was a disaster: the [Ionian Revolt ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Revolt)of 499–493 BC saw the Ionian cities try to shake off the domination of Persia. Despite some early successes, the Ionian war effort foundered in large part due to mutual distrust and bickering — at the climactic sea battle of [Lade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lade) in 494, the Ionian fleet dissolved as various contingents abandoned the battle or switched sides due to political infighting. The resulting Persian reconquest completely annihilated Miletus. Luckily for the Ionians the new Persian satrap [Artaphernes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artaphernes) adopted a conciliatory policy that allowed most of the cities to rebound quickly.
