# Why has such little research been done on the Indus Valley civilizations compared to the research done in Egypt and Mesopotamia, both archeologically and otherwise?

There are quite a lot of factors that combine to make this different:

Harappan culture wasn't clearly identified as such until the 20th century. Better known sites - Egypt being the obvious example - were studied intensively for centuries before the excavations. Its easy to be disnissive of the scholars who worked on these problems before modern archaeology evolved int he 19th century, but there is a lot of painstaking work in decipherment, interpretation and even very basic tasks like matching names to places which was ongoing for a long time in other sites. 

Likewise, the enigmatic nature of Indus valley civilization means there is no clear connection to any continuous literary traditions. This is bad for "PR", since a cvilization like Egypt has been an imaginative backdrop for literature and speculation throughout recorded history; We have a much harder time imagining the life of Mohenjo-Daro than we do that of Thebes or Nineveh because we don't have centuries of poems and paintings influencing our imaginations. Even though most of that stuff is "wrong", in the sense that archaeologists turn up their noses at the details, it's an important impetus to further study.

Likewise, the fact that we cannot read the language(s) of the Indus valley means a lot. We know a lot of rich, nuanced information about Egypt or Babylon or Sumer because we can read everything from laundry lists to religious texts to love letters. By contrast we don't even know what languages were spoken in the Indus valley sites. It's not helped by the fact that the assignment is heavily implicated in modern Indian politics. 

It's also true that archaeology, like most disciplines, depends more than people like to admit on... pizzazz. The pyramids and the colossal statues of Egypt, or the golden treasures of Tutankhamun, are easy to popularize. The giant stone lions of Nineveh, or the gory reliefs from the palace of Asshurbanipal, make great museum exhibits. Most ancient societies, however, exist for us mostly as collections of pot-sherds and statuettes. Even an expressive masterpiece like the Mohenjo-daro girl:

Will have a hard time attracing as much casual attention as King Tut:

That's not a judgement on the relative worth of the civilizations - but it does give you a good idea where casual viewers, TV documentaries, popular books, and (indirectly) research dollars are going to flow.

On the practical side, the Indus valley is heavily populated and has been continuously so for a long time. Isolation and abandonment are good for archaeologists: nobody lived in the Valley of the Kings, and most of the great cities of Mesopotamia were just faceless lumps of collapsed mud-brick for most of the last millenium. Indus Valley civilizations are studied more intensely than any other civilization in South Asia, but unless there is a spectacular, TV-worthy discover I doubt they'll ever get the same press as the others.
