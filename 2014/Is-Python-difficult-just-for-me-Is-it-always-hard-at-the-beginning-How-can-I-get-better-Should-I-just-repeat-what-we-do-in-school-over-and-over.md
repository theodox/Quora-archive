# Is Python difficult just for me? Is it always hard at the beginning? How can I get better? Should I just repeat what we do in school over and over?

Don't lose heart. Python is about as easy as it gets for languages which are not limited-use teaching languages, but it's still a lot to learn. 

Two things that can help:

First, do a lot of short, simple things - little functions and tests - just to make sure you're comfortable with the mechanics: python syntax, indentation, and particularly how to use lists and dictionaries effectively. This is not challenging for your brain - it's just practice for your fingers so you get used to things like closing quotes and parentheses as a matter of habit (you can cheat a bit and use an editor like PyCharm to help 'spell check' your code):

Then follow the advice here on how problems can be broken down into smaller units and taken apart one bit at a time. That does take getting used to but it's ultimately fun - and one nice thing about Python is that you can usually tell you're on the right track because the 'right' way usually looks and feels simpler than a wrong approach.

Lastly, remember that people have lots of different learning styles - your class might not be hitting yours. You could try some books or online courses - a lot of people like "Python the hard way" which includes both book and video material: [Learn Python](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)
