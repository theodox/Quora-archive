Individual traders passed back and forth, but there was nothing like regular government-to-government communication. The distances were too great, and the intervening powers were strongly interested in retaining their valuable positions as middlemen on the Silk Road.

There are two possible exceptions. A couple of Roman sources mention “envoys of the Seres” — ie, the Chinese — sent envoys to emperor Augustus; but there’s no corresponding mention of an embassy in Chinese records. Conversely, there’s a Chinese record of a Roman representative reaching the Chinese court in the name of Marcus Antonius (Sinified as _Ma An Tun_ ).

What probably happened in both cases is that in both cases, enterprising merchants portrayed themselves as representatives of their home governments. It’s not impossible that they did carry some kind of general message of goodwill from home, but it’s equally likely that they exaggerated their own importance as a way of opening doors in a new market.

As for practicalities — the only “direct” communication was by sea. The land route passed through the territory of the Parthians or Sassanians, who were quite anxious to make sure Rome and China could not bypass their trade monopolies. The route went from the Red Sea ports of Egypt to India, up the Bay of Bengal and thence overland, or by sea through the straits of Malacca to the South China Sea and Guangzhou.
