# If Cleopatra didn't kill herself, it seems like Octavian would have brought her to Rome to March in his triumph. But after that, would Octavian have executed her or would he have just exiled her to an island or put her on house arrest?

It’s an imponderable.

On the one hand, the Octavian of 30 BC was only a decade removed from the proscriptions and assassination of the second triumvirate — not a good augury for mercy. On the other, he was beginning the process of rebuilding his own image into what eventually became the modest, avuncular persona of “Augustus.”

You can see the fulcrum of this change right around the end of the war of Actium in the career of [Cicero Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero_Minor), Cicero’s son. Octavian had signed the proscription which saw the elder Cicero murdered, though most accounts agree that the real impetus for the killing came from Antony. But the year after the conquest of Egypt, the younger Cicero was suffect consul and proconsular governor of Syria — the first a major honor, the second a serious political and military responsibility. This might not have been entirely a matter of belated amends, however: it was consul Cicero who announced Antony’s death to the Senate, and proconsul Cicero who tore down all of Antony’s monuments and inscriptions in the east, providing a nice figleaf of deniability for any charge of vindictiveness against Octabian himself. The future Augustus was always good at N-dimensional chess games.

So, for Cleopatra the calculus would involve balancing the opportunity to display clemency against the risks that Cleopatra could somehow become a focus for opposition to his own power. Caesar’s tactical displays of _clementia_  were a key part of his appeal — one of the ways he tried to distance himself from scarier populist leaders like Clodius and Fulvia. Clearly Octavian was happy to [reap the reptutional rewards of Caesarian clemency in the cases of Antony and Cleopatra’s children](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-the-remaining-Seleucids-Ptolemys-and-Antigonids-after-the-Romans-conquered-their-respective-realms-Were-the-dynasties-executed-or-did-they-continue-on-as-local-strongmen/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=334042404&share=f98aeeb0&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer). On the other hand Cleopatra was a living link to the _real_ Caesar — and it’s easy to imagine Octavian losing sleep about her telling cocktail party stories in Rome [about the fate of Caesar’s biological son](https://www.quora.com/What-relation-was-Caesarion-to-Octavian-and-why-did-Octavian-have-him-killed/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=119418324&share=d9b6176b&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer). A lot, presumably, would depend on some closed-door conversations that we’d be unlikely ever to hear of — what kind of deals could be struck, and how much could the respective parties trust one another. Roman politics were often astonishingly pragmatic; if Cleopatra alive could add some luster to Octavian’s reputation, or save a few million sesterces in garrison money, she might very well have been given an chance.

Nonetheless, it’s probably telling that Cleopatra — the ultimate survivor — chose to take her own life rather than to trust herself to Octavian’s mercies. Having survived civil wars against three of her siblings and the murder of her elder sister by her father, she was clearly pretty good at calculation. If she thought the odds were poor, the probably were.
