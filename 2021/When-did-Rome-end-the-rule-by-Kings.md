The traditional date for the end of the Roman Kingdom is 509 BC, the consulship of [Lucius Junius Brutus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Junius_Brutus) and [Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Collatinus) — the leaders of a revolution which expelled the last King, [Tarquinius Superbus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus)(aka “Tarquin the Proud”)

_According to Roman patriotic legend, it was the rape of the noblewoman_ _[Lucretia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretia)_ _by Tarquin’s son, and her subsequent suicide, which kindled opposition to the monarchy. Here, in a painting by Titian (1571)_ 

Modern scholarship views the traditional story as just that — a story — whose connection to the actual founding of the Roman Republic is hard to really judge. Nonetheless there’s no more definitive evidence and no better date than 509.
