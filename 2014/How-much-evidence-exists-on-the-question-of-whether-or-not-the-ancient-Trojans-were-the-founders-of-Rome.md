How much evidence? Not much â€” just enough to be suggestive.

The likeliest evidence relates to the [Etruscans](http://www.ancient.eu/etruscan/), who were the dominant local culture at the time of Rome's founding ( "Roma" is originally an Etruscan word). There is [some DNA evidence which suggests that the Etruscans may have been immigrants from western Asia Minor ](http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/18/science/sci-etruscans18)-- that is, the neighborhood of historic Troy. This was a common position in ancient sources and is supported by some modern linguists. There's also the coincidental fact that the Etruscans were famous for their metalworking skills and the Anatolian cultures of the "Trojan" era were the most advanced metalworkers of the Mediterranean region.

We don't have enough original sources to verify this, but it is worth pondering.

It's certainly true that the Romans made use of Greek legendary motifs to assimilate themselves into the Greek world; many other cultures did the same thing as a way of finding common ground, and even if they didn't do it themselves the Greeks would be sure to do it for them (see Herodotus accounts of Phoenician history, for example) If the Etruscans = Tyrhennians = Lydians hypothesis is correct ([Etruscan origins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_origins)), though, it would explain why the Romans chose Aeneas and the Trojan exiles as their founding heroes rather than any of the many other mythological options. Or, it may explain why their Greek neighbors decided to identify them as Trojan relicts.

In either case it suggests that the identification has a nugget of historical value, but buried under a lot of later strata.
