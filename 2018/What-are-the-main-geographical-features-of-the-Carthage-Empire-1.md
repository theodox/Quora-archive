There are really three distinct phases in Carthginian history.

__A constellation of ports__ 

First, there’s the Phoenician trading “empire.” This is not an empire in the traditional sense — it was more like a string of trading posts and ports, spread out along the coast of North Africa from Cyrene west to Morocco, along the eastern and southern coasts of Spain, and on several of the islands in the western Mediterranean.

This loosely-knit collection of positions was not about political control — it was a support network for the trade in precious metals from Spain. The Phoenician homeland was under threat from the Assyrian empire; their security depended on being able to pay tribute. Spain had rich sources of copper, tin and above all of silver that could be used to buy off the Assyrian threat. These early Phoenician colonies were simply the support system for the metals trade — despite the appearance on the map they were not big blocks of territory but a constellation of individual settlements, only loosely connected to the peoples around them.

__A maritime empire__ 

Phoenicia was conquered by the Persians in 539 BC. The Persians still wanted tribute, but they were not as interested in extorting precious metals from the Phoenicians. Around the same time, the Greek cities were starting to field navies on a par with the Phoenicians (the two would face off at Salamis when when the Persians invaded Greece in 480) . These two developments disrupted the old trading-based system, cutting the Punic colonies in the western mediterranean loose from their mother country and forcing them to find a new economic foundation. Carthage emerged as the most important of these and it drew the other Punic settlements into its orbit, although they were not always happy to be commanded by Carthage. Carthage developed a strong navy which came to dominate the western mediterranean, enabling the Carthaginians to monopolize important trade routes. The Carthaginians worked hard to keep foreign shipping out of their end of the seas — the Greeks knew very little about the Atlantic coasts of Europe because the Carthaginians, who controlled all of the important anchorages west of Sicily, would not let them pass.

The Carthaginians came into conflict with the Greeks of Sicily. The Greeks were far from united, so it was easy for Carthage to back different factions whenever it was useful. Only the wealthy city of Syracuse was a serious rival, but many of the other Greek cities were content to ally with Carthage because they feared Syracuse. After a long series of increasingly bitter conflicts Sicily ended up divided between a Carthaginian sphere of interest in the south and west and a Greek zone, dominated by Syracuse, on the eastern and northern coasts of the island. Sicily was not heavily settled by Carthaginian people — although there were Punic towns, particularly [Motya ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motya)at the western end of the island. Much of the “Carthaginian” population of Sicily were actually mercenaries of many different backgrounds — Berber, Spanish, Celtic and Greek. Carthage actually referred to the Sicilian territory as the “camp”, that is, the military zone.

In 264, the Carthaginian-Syracusan rivalry expanded to include Rome, which intervened on behalf of Syracuse beginning the [First Punic War](https://www.ancient.eu/First_Punic_War/). This 20 year conflict ended with a Roman victory, reshaping the Carthaginian empire into its final form.

__North Africa and Spain__ .

Before the First Punic War Carthage’s ambitions were focused on the sea. However the defeat had hobbled their naval power, and also lost them important bases in Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily. The Carthaginians had to adapt.

They began to pay more attention to their immediate neighborhood. They made intensive investments in agriculture in the fertile coastlands of Tunisia and eastern Algeria (they also fought a bitter war with the Berber peoples of Libya, who tried and failed to resist Carthage’s new interest. Their territory maps neatly onto what would become the breadbasket of the Roman empire, rarely extending more than 150 miles from the sea and making excellent use of a good growing climate and well watered regions. After centuries of life on the sea, the Carthaginians discovered a genius for farming — later, the Romans would preserve Carthaginian books about agriculture for reference.

The new territories were more defensible, since the old overseas possessions had been lost. To the south and east, the frontier was a desert which demanded little attention or defense. To the west the Berber kingdoms of Numidia were a possible threat, but the Carthaginians courted them (literally: there was a lot of intermarriage) and incorporated their excellent cavalry into a rebuilt army, less dependent on mercenaries.

They also created a real territorial empire in Spain. They abandoned their old policy of sticking to trading posts and enclaves, and instead creating a network of alliances with some Spanish peoples and subjugating others. The new territories produced new soldiers — the Iberians were numerous and warlike — and within a generation the Carthaginians were dominant up to the Ebro river. The mineral resources were still formidable.

Despite their loss in the first Punic War, Carthage was stronger on the eve of the second — North Africa’s agricultural bounty, combined with the the manpower and mineral wealth of Spain, made for a potent combination.
