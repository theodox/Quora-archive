__Herodotus__ is hard to beat for his mix of entertainment value and data. On the superficial level, his _Histories_ are great collection of stories, ranging from believe-it-or-not stuff like giant ants digging gold out of the deserts of Afghanistan to epics like the last stand of the 300 at Thermopylae. Once you get past the superficial level, however, you find surprising ruminations about life in a world that was multicultural and complex in ways we can barely imagine. Every time you think he’s a naif reteller of travelers’ tales Herodotus will surprise you with his insights. Every time you start to trust him he’ll drop some crazy misinformation (get a copy, [like the Landmark edition](https://www.amazon.com/Landmark-Herodotus-Histories-Robert-Strassler/dp/1400031141), that has good notes !) On top of everything he’s charmingly inquisitive.

Plus, his many short excursions into sub-sub-sub-topics make for perfect bathroom reading.

If you’ve read the Iliad, the __Odyssey__ is an important bookend: a very different look at a similar world (there’s no strong consensus on whether Homer existed as an individual, or whether both poems are written by the same person). The comparison with the Iliad is instructive because the Odyssey shows those piratical heroes at home, where they lived a life with a very different set of obligations and mores than they showed on the battlefield. It also offers at least some perspective on the lives of people other than male aristocrats. One discovery I came to late is how much better Homer is as an audiobook: I’m pretty partial to [Dan Stevens’ reading of the Fitzgerald translation](https://www.amazon.com/The-Odyssey-audiobook/dp/B00HUC357Q/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=Homer&qid=1615750453&s=audible&sr=1-5) — but any good reading tends to diffuse the twin problems of scanning verse on the fly and following the many shifts of voice in the text.

If you’re interested in Stoic philosophy you could follow up with __Discourses of Epictetus,__  an influential first century Stoic and, interestingly, a former slave. These are — like Plato’s dialogues — fictionalized accounts of the conversations of a real person; it’s generally agreed that Arrian (the editor) did a good job of evoking a distinctive personality. Beside their systematic philosophical content these often include slice-of-life examples which provide glimpses of daily life.

If you’d like a contrast to Stoic seriousness, the __Golden Ass of Apuleius__ is picaresque story about a man who is magically transformed into a donkey. It includes a view of ordinary life in its messiness and vulgarity that is not often seen in classical texts. It also ends with a suprising religious conversion as the main character becomes a devotee of Isis. The author was a Berber from North Africa, writing a book set in Greece — the Egyptianate finale is a remarkable testimony to the complexity of Roman imperial society.

On the other hand, if you’re interested in philosophy in general, you’ll need to go back to the __dialogues of Plato.__ Generally Plato’s works are grouped into three categories: early works focusing on the life and ethics of Socrates; a middle period where Plato began to explore his own philosophical interests, and a late period where the themes of the middle period are articulated in greater technical detail.If you are short on time, the __Apology of Socrates__  and the __Crito__ (both early) are remarkable pieces of dramatized history mixed with philosophy. If you’re interested in politics, there are the __Republic__  and the __Laws__ (lots of folks don’t read the latter — but it’s an important counterweight to the former when figuring out “what Plato thought about politics”) . If you’re more into metaphysics, there’s the __Parmenides__ and __Theaetetus.__ However these are just selections: Plato wrote a lot, and much of what he wrote is fairly demanding. Apart from some of early dialogues its useful to have some of guide to look when picking readings.
