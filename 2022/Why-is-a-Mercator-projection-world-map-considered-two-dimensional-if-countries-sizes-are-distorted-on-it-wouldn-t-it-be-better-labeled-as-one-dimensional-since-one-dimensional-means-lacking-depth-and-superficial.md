# Why is a Mercator projection world map considered “two-dimensional” if countries’ sizes are distorted on it; wouldn’t it be better labeled as “one-dimensional” since one-dimensional means: lacking depth and superficial?

It has two dimensions - latitude and longitude. A one dimensional map would be a line.

People who are really invested in surface area should invest in globes. What is truly lacking depth and superficial is getting hung up on the apparent area of countries on a map — a concern that has been floating around the halls of faux outrage since it showed up on _The West Wing_ decades ago.
