# Suggested archaeologists have discovered a food stall in Pompeii that dates back to the first century AD. Would common working people have eaten there, or was this a luxury for the elite?

For most Romans, it was dining at home that represented a luxury reserved for the well off.

The densely packed tenements which served most urban Romans for housing frequently did not have kitchens: between the risk of fire and the difficulty of getting water to the upper floors, kitchens were fairly rare among the working classes and the poor. Small portable braziers (similar to a hibachi grill) were available — but ventilation was poor and the living quarters were often quite compressed. It was often easier and cheaper for the less well off to eat out at a local [thermopolium ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermopolium#:~:text=In%20the%20ancient%20Greco%2DRoman,ready%2Dto%2Deat%20food.)(fast-food counter) or [popina ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popina)(wine-shop); the former served hot food, the latter wine, cured meats, and other unheated foods like cheese or olives. Both of these also doubled as gambling dens or brothels on occasion.

The street level of a typical insula included a mix of shops and food stalls so a working-class Roman rarely had to go far for a meal or entertainment. In Pompeii — a city of about 15,000 — we’ve found more than 158 eating establishments in just the portion of the city that’s been excavated so far. There were also stalls on the streets selling snacks and to-go food. Roman historians assume that the Roman street food scene was similar in scale and to what you find in the developing world today.

Only better off families living in detached housing were likely to have a kitchen and the staff to keep it running. It’s notable that Roman stereotypes about women’s roles say a lot about supervising the household, spinning wool, and mending clothing but next to nothing about cooking. In the later Republic and the Empire the image of a woman baking her own bread is symbolic of rural simplicity and antique virtues — not of contemporary “luxurious” Roman life in the big city. In most households with kitchens, the cooking would be done by slaves.
