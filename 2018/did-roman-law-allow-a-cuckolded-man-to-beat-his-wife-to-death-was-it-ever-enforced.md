No, at least not according to the _[Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis](http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/wlgr/wlgr-romanlegal120.shtml)_ __ of 17 BC.

According to the law, a husband who killed his wife if caught in the act was to be punished less severely than an ordinary murderer, but the killing was still illegal. The proper legal remedy was a prosecution for adultery; if found guilty both parties would be banished and the woman would forfeit half her dowry.

A husband could not kill the male partner either if the other man was a free-born citizen. The only allowable targets for a “crime of passion” were slaves, freemen of the family, and “infamous” persons (a legal category which included prostitutes, actors, dancers, and musicians). These had to be caught in the act and in the husband’s own house.

A wife caught in the act had to be divorced within three days, or the husband became liable to prosecution as a panderer — a crime which could carry the death penalty for him under some circumstances, or loss of civic rights.

On the other hand the rules for ___fathers___ ____ were more merciless. A father could legally kill a daughter and her lover — regardless of legal status — if they were caught in illicit relations while she lived under her father’s roof. This was part of the larger principle of “[patria potestas](https://www.britannica.com/topic/patria-potestas),” the theoretically absolute power of the head-of-household. The same power also allowed a father to have a son killed for, say, cowardice, drunkenness, or running up debts. In historic times the full use of this power on any child was quite rare — emperor Augustus, who passed the laws which set the legal standard for punishing adultery, banished his own daughter for her frequent affairs but did not have her killed.
