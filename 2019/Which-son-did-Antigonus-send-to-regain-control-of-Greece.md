That would be [Demetrius Poliorcetes](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/demetrius-poliorcetes/), a fine example of the Hellenistic warrior-playboy. by the standards of that chaotic time he was fairly successful, but the Macedonian Dynasts of that period were all better at fighting than ruling — Demetrius’ career was checkered with serious ups and downs ( he lost his kingdom in the end to the equally inconsistent [Pyrrhus of Epirus](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/pyrrhus-of-epirus/)).

Although Demetrius died powerless his son [Antigonus II Gonatas](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/antigonus-ii-gonatas/) eventually secured the throne of Macedon, which remained in his family down to the Roman conquest.
