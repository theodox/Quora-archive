Depends on what you mean by “inappropriate.” Are you talking about dramatic range or acting skill? Do what you like.

But if you’re actually trying to cast somebody who might look like her, you need to do higher quality homework than the author of that article.

[Cleopatra was an ethnic Macedonian or Greek](https://www.quora.com/What-ethnicity-was-Cleopatra-Some-people-think-Greek-and-others-think-Egyptian) (take your pick — that’s a whole different piece of nationalist wrangling). Casting a modern day Egyptian actress to play her would be precisely as correct as casting an Indian actress to play Queen Victoria, who was officially “Empress of India.” Casting somebody from, say, Nigeria to play her would be like casting somebody from Myanmar as Victoria. It might be interesting to watch, but it’s junk history.

[The research cited in the linked Vox article is based on a couple of different weak links](https://rogueclassicism.com/2009/03/15/cleopatra-arsinoe-and-the-implications/). The notion that “Egyptologists doubt Cleopatra had all white ancestry”, as the article claims, is on about the same level as “doctors think vaccines cause autism”: one person with “Dr.” in front of their name does not create a consensus, and the scholarly consensus is _not_  that Cleopatra has African ancestry. If modern politics were not involved this is a supposition that would be relegated to the footnotes as an “interesting hypothesis” — treating it as if it were some kind of established fact is silly.

And it’s not a very strong hypothesis.

Essentially, the argument is that the remains from a tomb in Ephesus (modern Turkey) are those of Cleopatra’s sister, [Arsinoe IV](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/arsinoe-iv/). These bones, the argument goes, have evidence of African ancestry. There is no clear mention of who Cleopatra’s grandmother was, so let’s assume that maybe the grandmother was an Egyptian concubine. Presto! Non-European Cleopatra.

Unfortunately this hypothesis is involves a number of weak links.

First, it assumes that that the Ephesus tomb belongs to Cleopatra’s sister, There is however no actual evidence that is the case — it’s an interesting guess, based on the location and size of the tomb but nothing more. It’s not as if the building has an inscription reading “Here lies Arsinoe of Egypt.”

Second, it assumes that there’s clear evidence that the female body in the tomb had an African grandmother — but [the only DNA evidence available is very low quality](https://www.livescience.com/27459-cleopatra-sister-discovery-controversy.html). The actual “evidence” for the African origins of the body are based on cranial measurements done in the 1920’s — the actual skull, perhaps a bit conveniently, has been lost since then. So we’re basing an argument on “racial science” from a hundred years ago. How many fans of this hypothesis are excited about some of the _other_  assumptions about race and physiognomy that were common in that period?

Third, the bones from the tomb seem to belong to a girl 15 or 16 years of age — Arsinoe was 20 or 21 when Cleopatra had her murdered. It’s actually very difficult to judge these things from partial skeletons, so this is not clearly dispositive. But many of the usual reasons why a skeleton would look younger than it really is, such as malnutrition, don’t apply to royals.

Number four is a doozy: [the Ptolemies practiced incest as a way of keeping the crown inside the royal family](https://www.stephaniedray.com/2012/01/12/keeping-it-in-the-ptolemaic-family/) — it’s why we are extremely clear on who Cleopatra’s ancestors were for at least seven generations. Given that the royal family was so unwilling to allow even a foreign prince or princess into the royal line, it seems like a stretch for the daughter of a concubine would have assumed the throne without anybody remarking on it.

Fifth: even if you assume that Arsinoe was the daughter of a concubine that doesn’t prove that Cleopatra was.

Sixth: This is how Cleopatra portrayed herself on her coins:

And this is is believed to be the primary done-from-life portrait of her:

It’s true that there are Egyptian-oriented images of Cleopatra which seem to show a very different-looking person:

But the extremely formulaic tendencies of Egyptian art make it hard to rely on for portraits. This is how Egyptian artists depicted Roman emperor Augustus:

Who we know from quite a few other sources looked more like this:

Image based evidence is the bane of these kinds of discussions. But if the idea is accuracy, you have to work with the evidence you have.

__TLDR__ 

The _only_ reason we have this discussion at all is that we don’t have an explicit mention of the name of Cleopatra’s grandmother. Optimists can therefore insert an unnamed grandmother in there without any concrete evidence to the contrary.

And — let’s just speculate here, since that seems to be all one needs to do — the sole gap in the evidence could also explain mean that Cleopatra’s actually _Jewish._ Jews, after all, were about a third of the population of Alexandria when Cleopatra was born — there’s no reason to suppose they’d be less sought-after as concubines by a randy Ptolemy than Africans . For that matter, Ptolemaic Egypt was a clearinghouse for the Indian Ocean trade which connected the Mediterranean with India, so why not an Indian grandmother instead?

It can be fun to speculate about the blank spots in the historical record. But they are like Rorshach tests — you mostly see in them what you want to see. Don’t rely on them and certainly don’t treat them like “facts” if you don’t do the homework.
