In my field (video games) this is quite common for artists and game designers to maintain websites which display their best work. We used to rely more on CDs, VHS tapes or physical portfolios but over the last decade the most common way of presenting your visual work is via the web (or, occasionally, with a thumb drive -- but much of the time the thumb drive has a copy of your website on it.)

Results will vary by field, though. I imagine that the universal rule of demo reels still applies: limit it to the best material and don't pad!
