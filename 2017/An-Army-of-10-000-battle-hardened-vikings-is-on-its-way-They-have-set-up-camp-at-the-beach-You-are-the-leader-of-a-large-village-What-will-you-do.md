10,000 is a _huge_ number for a Viking raid — when [Harald Hardrada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Hardrada) tried to conquer England (just ahead of the Normans) he brought only 15,000. A 10,000 man raid probably means a literal shipload of warriors for every one of us. There’s nothing a village — even a big and prosperous village — can do against a force like that. York — the second largest city in England — surrendered to Hardrada without a fight.

We’re not going to do better.

_Bad news_ 

__The right thing to do is to run__ . As far and as fast as possible, taking only movable property that won’t slow us down. We need to run because [Vikings are slavers](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/12/151228-vikings-slaves-thralls-norse-scandinavia-archaeology/): if this is just a huge raid, they won’t be content with just shaking us down for our goods — our children and young people will be carted off, and those of us who aren’t worth taking will probably be knocked on the head.

_Viking slave fetters_ 

So, __leave them our goods__  — which, apart from livestock, won’t amount to much anyway — and head for somewhere to hopefully wait out the passage of the Viking force. Take as much of the livestock as we can to keep ahead of them (ideally, we take any horses or simply turn them loose: leaving them penned up for the Vikings to find simply means we have to deal with cavalry). If there’s long-lasting food (cheese, for example, or dried salt fish) we should hide it, because after the dust settles we’ll have a miserable year of rebuilding and living rough.

The hardest question will be deciding whether to stay together or disperse: smaller groups will move faster and can find more hiding places, but bigger ones will be better able to survive. Deciding how to break up families and vital supplies will be difficult and heart-wrenching, so it may be best to stay together even if it puts us all at risk.

The best places to go would be __inaccessible spots,__  like a deep swamps, thick woods, or a rugged range of hills — places that don’t usually host people, so they won’t be attractive to raiders. The main thing to look for there will be good water — we won’t be able to hold out long without it. Depending on where we have to hide, we may have to slaughter a lot of our precious cows and sheep: pigs will be the most adaptable to different diets, so the pickier eaters will have to be eaten first.

_Empty, swampy, unappealing — perfect, as long as we can improvise shelter for us and our pigs._ 

It would be good to send a few young men on to __warn the local count or earl__  and the other nearby villages. But we can’t expect the lord to come riding to our rescue: they’ll be as outclassed as we are against an army of 10,000 . The likeliest outcome will be that local forces retreat to find the king, perhaps staging some delaying actions to buy time for a royal army to assemble, or occupying a strong defensive position to slow the invaders down. That could take weeks, so we need to plan for staying alive in the wilderness… the wilder the better — we want to be well away from those Vikings and their slaving ways.

While we hide, we will need to __keep up with the news__  — but it will be dangerous. At the least anybody we send out to bring information will run the risk of being caught and enslaved; at worst, the Vikings won’t hesitate to use torture to find out where people and livestock are hiding. Ideally hunters or woodsmen will make the best scouts, good at moving in secret and familiar with the local terrain. Just to be safe, we should pre-arrange a system of indirections to keep our scouts themselves ignorant of our actual location. Rather than reporting directly back to us they should rendezvous with other scouts well away from our camp. They can’t be tortured into telling what they don’t know.

If this huge host is just a raid, we only need to __wait and attract no notice__ . The little our village has to offer by way of physical goods won’t interest a force this large for long. But a big force like this is probably something else: an actual invasion. Our best hope is that the army moves on quickly, looking for the royal army that will be assembling somewhere. If not, we can hope that their stay is short lived: 10,000 men require a lot of food and water, and we have to hope that they move on and find somewhere else before the weather turns bad or our food stocks run out.

Above all, we have to __pray for a speedy decision__ . Ending the fighting, no matter who wins, is more important for our survival than anything else. If things run longer we may have a dreadful decision to make — can we afford not to return and tend our fields? That pretty much guarantees that we will starve next year. We might otherwise have to disperse trying to find other villages to take us in. We won’t be able to go as a group if that happens — no local community, no matter how charitable, will be able to support us all on their meager resources. If the Vikings stay long enough to disrupt the cycle of planting and harvesting, our community is dead, even if many of us survive as individuals. Perhaps in a few years we can return. Perhaps.

So __we want the war over more than we care who wins__ . It’s entirely possible that the Vikings will be our new masters next year: A 10,000 strong force, already assembled, may very well beat whatever forces the king can assemble in a hurry. If so, we’ll be paying our taxes to a new jarl but our lives will probably be much the same. It may actually be worse for us if the king’s forces win — if he decides to ratchet up our taxes to pay for the expenses of the war, we could lose much of what we’ve saved. In either case we’ll still have to repair our homes and we’ll suffer at least a year or two of privation.

No matter what happens, our best bet is to do our best to attract as little notice of the powerful on either side as we can. Abstract ideas about politics and loyalty are luxuries we can’t afford: __not starving or freezing to death is the only victory we can hope to win__ . These are not good times to be an ordinary person in the path of a Viking raid or a royal feud.
