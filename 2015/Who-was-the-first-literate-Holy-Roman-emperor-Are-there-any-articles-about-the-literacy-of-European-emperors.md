[Charlemagne](http://www.historyinthemargins.com/2011/08/23/charlemagne-the-education-emperor/) might just qualify. He learned to speak Latin and Greek alongside Frankish, and he tried to learn his letters as an adult but was embarassed by his poor skills and hid them from his court; as Einhardt says



> He learnt, too, the art of reckoning, and with close application scrutinised most carefully the course of the stars. He tried also to learn to write, and for this purpose used to carry with him and keep under the pillow of his couch tablets and writing-sheets that he might in his spare moments accustom himself to the formation of letters. But he made little advance in this unfamiliar task, which was begun too late in life


Otto II and Otto III both studied as children with [Gerbert d'Aurillac](http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/convergence/gerbert-daurillac-and-the-march-of-spain-a-convergence-of-cultures-gerbert-daurillac), a polymath who helped popularize arabic numerals and Aristotelian logic in Europe and who eventual became [Pope Sylvester II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sylvester_II) with Otto III's support. It's a good bet that both were literate and numerate.
