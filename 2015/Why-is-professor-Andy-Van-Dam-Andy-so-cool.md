He literally 'wrote the book' on computer graphics: the standard text for many years (I'm not sure about these days) was [Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice .](http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Graphics-Principles-Practice-3rd/dp/0321399528/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1421301911&sr=1-1)

 While many things in the book are commonplace now, those techniques were revolutionary in the 90's and the book is one of the standard texts in the field.
