# Why do big companies use Maya and 3ds Max instead of Blender even though they have to pay for it?

The cost of switching can be enormous, if your pipeline is deeply entwined with a particular piece of software. Far too much of the nitty-gritty work of moving 3d data around involves dealing with the quirks and limitations of particular pieces of software. Switching to another one - even one that’s objectively better - is expensive and risky. And, despite the strides that Blender has made, it’s not objectively better in any way other than price.

The other big factor in switching is the market for trained people. While there are some amazing Blender artists out there, most professional artists and animators are trained on the big commercial packages. They know, quite rightly, that it’ll be harder for them to get a job as Blender artists than as Max or Maya (or Houdini, or Cinema 4D) people. This creates a chicken-and-egg situation where companies looking for the best talent won’t go looking for it in the Blender community. And it keeps those companies locked into their existing pipelines, which perpetuates the situation.

Switching packages is usually a big, costly, and complex culture shift in the life of a company (check out [this thread](http://discourse.techart.online/t/transitioning-studio-from-3ds-max-to-maya/8646/25) for a candid look at pros talking about it among themselves). Excellent software like SoftImage XSI can [wither on the vine](http://theodox.github.io/2014/sigh) if it doesn’t create enough market momentum. Blender hasn’t yet hit the point where the case for switching is more compelling than the seat cost, and it may never get there — though I, for one, would love it if that day ever comes. I’m not expecting it any time soon, however.
