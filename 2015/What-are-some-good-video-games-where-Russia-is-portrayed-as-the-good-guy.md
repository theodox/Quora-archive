I'd just add in passing that the numbers would be a lot better [if Russians bought games in greater numbers](http://kotaku.com/5955739/welcome-to-russia-where-most-of-your-friends-are-video-game-pirates). There is a pretty strong correlation between low sales numbers and getting cast as a villain (watch as the number of Chinese bad guys drops now that [China is finally legalizing foreign consoles](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/25/9039995/china-ends-ban-on-video-game-consoles)) . Big companies -- like publishers -- don't want to offend potential customers, but they don't have much of an incentive to worry about the sensibilities of people who never spend money on their product. Eventually all game villains will be North Korean.
