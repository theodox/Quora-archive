Well they’re both different tools that do the same job; there’s a million differences in detail but they can be more or less used interchangeably.

At the risk of angering the fanboys, I’d summarize it like this (these are generalizations, there are plenty of things to quibble about on the detail level

__Max__ 

Good modelling tools

Easier interface for beginners

OK, but not great animation tools.

Good range of materials, but material management is clunky

Scripting and pipeline work is awkward

__Maya__ 

Harder to learn at first

Easier to customize for experienced users

Materials take more work, but are more flexible and customizable

So-so modelling tools

Better for animation and rigging

Scripting and pipeline work is easier

They’re both good tools, and individuals will always have their preferences. My personal experience —- as a very technically inclined user — is that Max is easier to get started with but tops out lower, while Maya has a longer learning curve but can be more powerful for experts. Your mileage may vary.
