The “father of history” title goes to the Greek historian [Herodotus](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/herodotus/), although it was the Roman orator [Cicero ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero)who actually [coined the phrase](https://topostext.org/work/752#1.4).

[He certainly deserves the title](https://qr.ae/pvw06q): although plenty of people before him had recorded events, and some had even tried to collect ancient records, we know of know one before Herodotus who tried to systematically assemble a narrative of past events by comparing differing accounts, written records and physical evidence. Herodotus certainly got a lot of things wrong; but he showed his homework, so to speak: he explained his sources, presented alternate interpretations the facts, and invited the reader to weigh conflicting evidence. In short, he moved from simply repeating traditional stories to actually studying the past.

Herodotus’ achievement was widely recognized in antiquity, which is why it spawned so many imitators — and critics.

Plutarch was one of the most pungent of those critics — an unusually acerbic position for a writer who was usually good natured and open minded. However, Plutarch was a proud [Boeotian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeotia), and he took pretty violent exception to the way Herodotus characterized the role of the Boeotians and particularly of Thebes in the Persian war. Herodotus portrays the Thebans as eager collaborationists who wanted to use the arrival of the Persians to settle scores with their local enemies. Plutarch could not forgive this portrayal of his beloved homeland and wrote an entire book, _[On The Malice of Herodotus](http://www.bostonleadershipbuilders.com/plutarch/moralia/malice_of_herodotus.htm)_ , devoted to [critiquing Herodotus in pretty much any way possible](https://kosmossociety.chs.harvard.edu/plutarchs-on-the-malice-of-herodotus/). It’s generally regarded as an uncharacteristic hit-piece, grasping at straws to find any way to cast shade on Herodotus’ account — in particular his most common criticism is that Herodotus is too fair to the Persians and insufficiently patriotic. It rather shows that even a great writer can lose his temper once in a while., it’s practically a pen-and-papyrus twitter barrage.
