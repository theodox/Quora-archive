There’s no doubt at all about the ethnic origins of Nubian pharaohs of the [Twenty-fifth Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt##targetText=The%2025th%20dynasty%20was%20a,Egypt%20from%20744%E2%80%93656%20BC) (744–565 BC) :

[Piye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piye)

[Shebitku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebitku)

[Shabaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabaka)

[Taharqa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taharqa)

and as an edge-case [Tantamani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantamani) who tried unsuccessfully to restore Nubian power.

Some Egyptologists think that the name of a Fourteenth dynasty pharaoh [Nehesy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehesy)indicates a Nubian origin. However, he ruled from Avaris in the delta, which was generally a stronghold of Canaanites and was a long way from Nubia. On the other hand he may be the son of a queen named [Tati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tati_(queen)), who seems to have been a Nubian princess. Nehesy’s period — the [Fourteenth Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt) — is a time of fragmentation in Egypt (there was a completely separate [Thirteenth Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt) ruling at the same time in upper Egypt) and so we don’t know much about the details. During this period Nubians were also encroaching on Egypt from the south but not ruling as pharaohs.

The example of Tati and Nehesi suggests that there may have been Kushite blood in the Egyptian royal families even when the dynasties were “Egyptian.” We know that most pharoahs had multiple wives and that foreign princesses from all of Egypt’s diplomatic partners found their way into the royal halls: [Amenhotep III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenhotep_III) (to take a famous example) had one Syrian wife, two Mitanni wives, two Babylonian wives and an Arzawa wife. So — like European royals today — the connection between royal blood and domestic ethnicity could be pretty complicated.

On the other hand some other dynasties are less likely to have had sub-Saharan pharaohs (unless through diplomatic marriages as above) since we know they came from elsewhere: the [Twenty-second ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Dynasty_of_Egypt)and [Twenty-third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-third_Dynasty_of_Egypt) dynasties were ethnic Libyans, the [Fifteenth Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt) were Semitic Hyksos, and of course there were the Persians, Macedonians and Romans.

There are of course an infinite number of claims about other pharaohs; they tend to bog down in unverifiable assumptions of many kinds from many different directions. Nobody in Egyptology, however, debates the ethnic origins of the 25th dynasty which are indisputable.
