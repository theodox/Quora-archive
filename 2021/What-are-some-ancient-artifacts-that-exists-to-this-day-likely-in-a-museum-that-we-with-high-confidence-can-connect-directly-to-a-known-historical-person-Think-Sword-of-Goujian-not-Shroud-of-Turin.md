# What are some ancient artifacts that exists to this day (likely in a museum), that we with high confidence can connect directly to a known historical person? (Think "Sword of Goujian", not "Shroud of Turin")

Here’s a few of my favorites:

This may not look like much, but it’s a big piece of history: it’s the victory monument originally erected to celebrate the Greek victory over the Persians at Plataea by [Pausanias,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pausanias_the_Regent) the Spartan general commanding the united Greek forces. The monument was controversial because Pausanias claimed more or less sole credit for the victory; after his downfall in a domestic political struggle, his original inscription was removed and replaced with one that shared the credit among the allies. It was later moved to the imperial hippodrome of Constantinople, and today it still sits Istanbul. One of the serpent heads which used to crown it is visible in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum.

From a different corner of antiquity: This cuneiform tablet tablet (currently in the Pergamon museum in Berlin) records the distribution of rations accorded to the captive king 'Ya’u-kīnu, king of the land of Yāhudu — in more familiar forms, [Jeconiah, king of Judah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeconiah), who was carted off by the Babylonians after Nebuchudnezzar took Jerusalem in 597 BCE.

Another biblical one — this time it’s pretty tiny. This is the impression made by the sealing ring of king [Hezekiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah), king of Judah from 729 to 686 BCE. He was king of during the time of the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem in 701. There’s a similar seal which may have belonged to Hezekiah’s contemporary the prophet [Isaiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah), but it’s [interpretation and authenticity are disputed](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/seal-prophet-isaiah-180968255/).

This silver platter was tableware belonging to Gelimer, the last Vandal king of Africa. It’s currently in the [Bibliotheque National de France](http://medaillesetantiques.bnf.fr/ws/catalogue/app/collection/record/ark:/12148/c33gbfs80). It’s inscribed GEILAMIR REX VANDALORVM ET ALANORVM, “Gelimer, king of the Vandals and the Alans”.

Speaking of barbarian kings, this is the personal signet ring of [Alaric II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_II), king of the Visigoths 484–507. From the Kunsthistoriches Museum in Vienna.

Returning to Greece, these five items aren’t exactly personal possessions, though they are all inscribed with names. They are [ostraka](https://joyofmuseums.com/museums/europe/greece-museums/athens-museums/museum-of-the-ancient-agora/ostraka-for-ostracism/): pieces of broken pottery used as voting tokens. The Athenians used them they voted to exile an unpopular politician — and given the fractious nature of Athenian politics they include a number of historically famous names. The five above are for [Themistocles ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themistocles)(who defeated the Persians at Salamis); [Aristides the Just ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristides)— a man so fair he helped an illiterate farmer to fill out an ostrakon voting to have him exiled; [Cimon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimon), the leader of the conservative faction in Athens on the eve of the Peloponessian war; [Pericles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles), the leader of the democratic faction and the architect of the Athenian empire; and finally [Alcibiades ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcibiades)— notorious playboy, talented admiral, and reputedly the lover of Socrates.

Photo: Olympia Museum.

Maybe the coolest of all: this helmet belong to Miltiades, who led the Athenians to victory over the Persians at Marathon. After the battle he dedicated as an offering to Zeus; it’s inscribed with his name, as you can make out in the photo above. It’s in the [Olympia Museum](http://www.olympia-greece.org/museum.html).
