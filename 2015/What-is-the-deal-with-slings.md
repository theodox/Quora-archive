They were not a prestige weapon in Europe, since they were cheap and easy to manufacture, but in the right hands they could be very deadly. 

In early times Rhodes and the Balearic Islands produced the best slingers, and they were popular sources for mercenary troops. They specialized primarily as skirmishers: slings, with long range and a high rate of fire were excellent for harassment and suppression fire even though they were not usually deadly against armored opponents. Against lightly armored foes they could be disabling or deadly. The main drawback (relative to bows) is that slings need a lot of space: archers can move and fight in tight formations but slingers need to disperse, so they could not double as light infantry.

In later Roman times military writers like [Vegetius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Flavius_Vegetius_Renatus) recommended that every soldier be trained in the sling as a 'backup weapon' -- a way to harass enemies at a distance without expending limited resources like javelins or arrows. This may also reflect the fact that late Roman armies tended to face lightly armored opponents.

When the Spanish conquered Central America, they learned to respect the Aztec _Tēmātlatl,_ which was dangerous even to sophisticated 16th c armor.
