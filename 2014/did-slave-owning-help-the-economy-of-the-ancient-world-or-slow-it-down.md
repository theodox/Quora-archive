Finley's take is interesting (and he's a great writer, so it's compelling) but it it is, as [User](https://www.quora.com/profile/User-386804) points out also controversial. Finley regards social attitudes as more important than economic rationality, arguing that ideology and social aspirations shape behavior more effectively than either "laws of the market" or attempts at optimization.

Some quick things you can point out from a more conventional modern economic standpoint:

Cheap labor tends to discourage technological innovation, since the return on investment is lower. Just as an example, we know that [Hero of Alexandria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria) discovered the basics of steam power in the first century, but the invention was not 'commercialized' in any way. It is widely believed that the Black Death encouraged technological innovation in Western Europe by decimating the labor supply.

Dependence on slavery introduces a peculiar set of economic variables of its own. In a way it's like _oil_ : when slaves are the basis of all sorts of other production, the supply of slave labor has a knock-on effect on the whole economy. There were several sources of slaves: prisoners of war, cross-border trade, slaves having children, and voluntary slavery. The supply of prisoners, of course, varies a lot dependent on external forces; and this can have a variety of fallouts. The huge influx of slaves after the Punic wars, for example, fundamentally transformed the Italian countryside, turning the small peasant farms into huge _latifundia_ (plantations) farmed by slaves. You could see this as 'progress' - similar to inclosure in the 18th century, which made farming much more efficient and allowed big landowners to amass capitalâ€¦ but it also destroyed a lot of lives and depopulated large parts of, say, Scotland.

Of course, if the supply of slaves dries up this system also begins to fall apart - in later antiquity when population decline was a problem (from plagues, possibly climate change, and political-military instability) the big industrial slave enterprises often broke up as wealthy people focused on creating self-sufficient "sustainable" local economies. This was safer, but also definitely slowed economic activity overall and led to the low-trade pattern of the early middle ages -- as well as the replacement of slavery with serfdom.

Slavery complicates the transmission of what we would call 'intellectual property'. In a world without copyright and patents, trade secrets tend to be jealously guarded and passed down through families or guilds. Slaves -- who can't just leave to become competitors once they have left your employ - may be important to a secretive owner. This may be good for individual enterprises but it is bad for the spread of technologies and ideas. It is often, however, better for the slaves themselves - if you're one of the few who knows a secret, you're valuable.

To my mind, though, the essence of the economic problem is almost the same as the moral problem: slavery is a terrible waste of human potential. It takes time and energy to match a worker and a job. When you're trying to make life for yourself that is time well spent - but most slavers are too lazy or too interested in quick turnaround to bother. If you take a well-educated person and condemn them to the galleys, its a net loss for the economy as well as a crime against humanity. Roman history, in particular, has lots of examples of slaves who managed to become wealthy and powerful (one never-to-be-forgotten aspect of ancient slavery, unlike the US variety, is that it was possible and not all that uncommon for slaves to earn their own freedom) But there must have been many more people, equally talented, who never manage to become free and wasted their abilities on drudge work. It's a pretty tragic waste.
