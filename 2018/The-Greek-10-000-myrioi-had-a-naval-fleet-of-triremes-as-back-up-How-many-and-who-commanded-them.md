There was not much of a naval component to the expedition.

The 10,000 were recruited by [Cyrus the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Younger), a junior Persian prince who was challenging his older brother [Artaxerxes II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia) for the imperial throne. Cyrus was the satrap of Lydia, Phrygia and Cappadocia — that is, most of Asia Minor — and the highest-ranking Persian commander in the west.

Cyrus’ plan for attacking Artaxerxes was an overland march through modern Turkey and down the Euphrates into Mesopotamia. Cyrus did, in fact, control most of the Persian naval forces in the Aegean and Black Seas, but he had little need for them as he marched west. The primary service that the fleet performed was ferry duty, delivering 700 hoplites to Cyrus. Here’s pretty much all that is known about Cyrus’ fleet:

> Here [at Tarsus] they halted three days, and here Cyrus was joined by his fleet. There were thirty-five ships from Peloponnesus, with the Lacedaemonian admiral Pythagoras on board. These had been piloted from Ephesus by Tamos the Egyptian, who himself had another fleet of twenty-five ships belonging to Cyrus. These had formed Tamos's blockading squadron at Miletus, when that city sided with Tissaphernes; he had also used them in other military services rendered to Cyrus in his operations against that satrap. There was a third officer on board the fleet, the Lacedaemonian Cheirisophus, who had been sent for by Cyrus, and had brought with him seven hundred hoplites, over whom he was to act as general in the service of Cyrus.

The closest thing to a “naval engagement” in the campaign happened during the march through Cilicia when a rumor about the presence of some of Cyrus ships had caused the Cilicians to abandon a strong defensive position in the mountains for fear of being flanked.

_The route of the 10,000 (and Cyrus) to the climactic battle at Cunaxa_ 

After Cyrus was killed in the battle of [Cunaxa](https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Cunaxa), near Babylon, the Greek mercenaries in his army had to escape. The situation was complicated by the fact that the leadership and many of the soldiers in the Greek force were Spartans: Tissaphernes — despite the fact that he had engineered the Persian-Spartan alliance in the Peloponessian war — was determined to punish the Spartans for supporting his rival. This made an escape to the west much more dangerous, so the 10,000 followed the Tigris north to the Armenia, and thence to the Black Sea near [Trabzon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabzon).

Once they mercenaries reached Trabzon (a Greek city, although nominally subject to the Persians) they still had to work out a way to return home. Tissaphernes — who had taken over Cyrus’ command as satrap of Lydia — was still in the way of a march back towards familiar territory. The mercenaries borrowed a couple of ships from the Greeks of Trabzon and chose a Spartan named [Cheirisophus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheirisophus_(general)) to commandeer enough ships from the Black Sea trade to bring the army back to Greece. However he wasn’t able to put together enough shipping, and the resulting arguments split the army in two — one part departed using the ships he had gotten and the rest had to march west along the coast. Eventually, the Persian satrap of Phrygia bribed the Spartan admiral Anaxibius, stationed in Byzantium on the Greek side of the Hellespont, to evacuate the mercenaries by sea as a cheaper alternative to fighting them.
