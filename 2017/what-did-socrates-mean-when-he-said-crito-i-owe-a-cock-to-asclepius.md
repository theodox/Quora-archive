Greek tradition involved offering animal sacrifice to the gods for favors received or sought. Presumably Socrates had made a vow to [Asclepius](http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/Asklepios.html) and gotten what he wanted, so he felt honor bound to pay it back.

As a parting statement, it’s a brilliant example to Plato’s often under-appreciated skills as a dramatist. The long, monologues-disguised-as-dialogues in the _Republic_ often make people forget that before Plato was a philosopher, he was a playwright.

On one level, fulfillment of the vow is a jab at Socrates’ accusers: they had him killed for “impiety” and yet here he displays humble, conventional piety. It shows how wrong they were about his character and motives.

Beyond that, it’s a teasing paradox.

Is it a darkly ironic Socrates thanking Asclepius — the god of medicine — for the poison he was just forced to take?

Is it a sincere Socrates — who in the _Phaedo_  says that a true philosopher longs for the release of death — saying the same thing with a different meaning?

Perhaps it is a gentle reminder of the fundamental theme of _Crito_ , the idea that justice is a contract between the individual and the laws. Socrates’ heroic refusal to break the law and save his own life is symbolized by his strict observance of this very minor obligation in the face of his own imminent death.

Or all of the above. There’s a reason Plato is worth reading for more than just the theories.
