[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Churchill,_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough) led the coalition of forces that opposed Louis XIV during the [War of the League of Augsburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Years%27_War) and the [War of the Spanish Succession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession). This was the first "world war", with engagements in the Americas and in Asia as well as heavy fighting in Europe involving all of the major European powers except for Russia. 

Although Marlborough did not conquer vast territories or ride in triumph through the ruins of Versailles, he played a weak hand with amazing dexterity. 

France was overwhelmingly the pre-eminent power of the age, wealthy, militarily sophisticated, and led by an efficient and single minded monarch. Marlborough came from a fractious England (the Jacobites were still a viable threat to the Protestant monarchy, Whigs and Tories were bitterly divided, and eventually Queen Anne was easily manipulated by her close friends and advisers); he had to unite the small, poorly equipped English forces with a multinational coalition including the very Protestant Holland and the very Catholic Holy Roman Empire and defeat the greatest army in Europe. The Dutch were extremely unwilling to abandon their border fortifications for mobile operations; the Empire was perpetually short of money and troops, while providing generals who schemed and plotted against their allies and each other. The French, on the other hand, had excellent roads, vast armies, and interior lines.

Nevertheless, Marlborough managed to keep the dicey alliance together and to defeat the French time and time again through two wars. Simply preventing the allies from defecting or betraying each other was a significant diplomatic achievement, and keeping armies fed and clothed despite dodgy finances and shifting political winds was an equally impressive feat of logistics. Marlborough scored major battlefield victories at [Blenheim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blenheim), [Ramillies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ramillies), [Oudenarde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Oudenarde), and the seige of [Bouchain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Bouchain), as well as a host of lesser engagements, despite never once possessing significant advantages in men or materiel. His biggest "loss" was a bloody Pyrrhic victory at [Malplaquet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Malplaquet), which might have been a good days work for many lesser generals. 

One of the most interesting aspects of Marlborough's generalship is his penchant for maneuver in an age that was obsessed with fortification and sieges. This was the high point of Vauban-style fofrtifications, the peak of the gunpowder era forts. Here's the main theater of operations:

Where every polygon is a fortified city or fortress. Despite this environment (also crisscrossed with rivers and canals) Marlborough maneuvered speedily and stealthily -- in many ways anticipating the style of Napoleon, though with a smaller force and far worse roads. Here's the campaign of Blenheim, for example.

On a smaller scale he repeatedly baffled and eluded his enemies with deceptive marches and ambiguous positions.

As for his impact on the modern world: France was the European superpower of his day, with no single rival that could stand in its way. When Louis XIV succeeded in getting a french prince on the throne of Spain - a fading power, but with a vast empire in the Americas - there was a real likelihood that the continent would become a french empire (the coalition that Marlborough led was eerily similar to the one had such a hard time defeating Napoleon a century later -- but without the might of Russia or the wealth of British India). If things had worked out differently: A Bourbon empire from the Atlantic to the Vistula? A Franco-Spanish empire from Peru to Hudson's Bay? It's almost incalculable how different things would be. 

Even Napoleon's troops knew it. That's why they marched into battle singing






(although in the French version, he dies on the field, not at home in [Blenheim Palace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blenheim_Palace)!).
