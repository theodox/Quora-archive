The Sumerians got there first. Many times if you looking for a “first recorded X” in history you’re going to land in Sumer, simply because the Sumerians had a big head start: at least 700 years, give or take.

To some degree, though, the dichotomy is a false one. It’s at least as fair to refer to the civilization of 3d millennium BC Mesopotamia as “Sumero-Akkadian” as it is to talk about a “Greco-Roman” civlization. Akkadian speakers borrowed a lot from Sumer: the art of writing, of course, but also religious and cultural styles. We don’t have lot of solid evidence for how Sumerians and Akkadians thought of themselves in contrast to one another: while we can see patterns — say, Akkadian names suddenly cropping up in the ruling classes of formerly all-Sumerian cities — it’s hard to know exactly what they mean: an ambitious courtier of Sumerian descent can adopt an Akkadian name, just as an Akkadian can go learn to write Sumerian poetry as part of his scribal exams.

Although at some point Sumerians and Akkadians were distinct ethnic groups they inhabited the same physical spaces for a long, long time. The first Akkadian writing appears around 2500 BC; Sumerian seems to disappear from everyday use around 2000 BC — five hundred years later. The two languages coexisted in common use longer than Norman French and Old/Middle English did in Great Britain. The common Mesopotamian culture of the following two millennia included elements of both.

Nevertheless…. the Sumerians were there first, so they get all the internet cred.

_A good example of Sumerian survival: the_ _[Law Code of Ur-Nammu](https://www.worldhistory.org/Code_of_Ur-Nammu/)_ _, from 2100 BC or so, is three centuries or thereabouts later than the rise of the first Akkadian empire under Sargon. It predates the more famous code of Hammarabi (which was written in Akkadian —but for a king who was himself an Amorite) by three and a half centuries.
