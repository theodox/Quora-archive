__Sparta__  is the city — or more properly the “township” — of the Spartans. It was a collection of four settlements: the villages of Limnai, Konoura, Pitana and Mesoa around the river Eurotas.

__Lacedaimon__ is the Spartan city-state, as opposed to the physical environs of the city proper. It’s more of a political than a topographical name: the “USSR” as opposed to “Russia.” However it can also refer to the “Spartan plain” where the main Spartan settlements were situated.

__Laconia__  is the south-eastern part of the Peloponesse — basically, Spartan territory excluding Messenia (which was the southwestern part of peninsula). It’s older core territory of the Lacedaimonians. Messenia was always known as occupied territory.

So, roughly, you could say that Laconia contains Lacedaimon which contains Sparta, though in practice the usage was fuzzy (as with “USSR” and “Russia”, not everyone troubled to get it right).
