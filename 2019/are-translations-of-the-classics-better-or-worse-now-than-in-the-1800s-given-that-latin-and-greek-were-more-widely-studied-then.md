# Are translations of the classics better or worse now than in the 1800s, given that Latin and Greek were more widely studied then?

It’s not really an easy question to answer.

Generally, the run of language skills in Latin and Greek really was higher back then — you can squeak through the language requirements for a classics degree in a modern grad school while operating at a level that would have not been regarded as particularly impressive for an undergraduate in the 1890’s …. indeed, my own language attainments as a grad student would have had me sitting in the back row of a classroom in many 19th century high schools with a dunce cap on. Since we’ve essentially abandoned the teaching of Latin or Greek composition, even at the graduate level, it’s very difficult for us to reach natural-language fluency: it’s all input and no output, so most of us are really operating as high-class code-crackers rather than as _readers._ 

On the other hand, we have access to a range of scholarly resources that are much broader than those available a century or more back. With the internet you can fire up the [LSJ ](http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/lsj/#eid=1)to look up an unfamiliar word and click on a few links to see how its used in context, where even twenty years ago you’d have had to trudge off to a suitably equipped library, find the word (in tiny print!) in a big book, then hope you could remember how those heavily abbreviated author and title references worked, then go see if the library actually had one, and then hope the editions it had were pretty good (and weren’t checked out, and were not yellowing century-old ones that could barely be read without a magnifying glass…. you get the idea).

So we have removed a tremendous burden of memorization and human willpower from classicists, replacing it to some degree with electronic tools that make up for our atrophied capacities. Depending on your tastes, you might find that a good thing or a bad thing.

But, I’m not sure it really affects the very small subset of people who will actually devote several years of their lives to producing a translation. And here, there’s a happy medium that lets one wriggle off the hook of “better” and “worse” once and for all.

The fact is, English (and the other modern languages) have themselves changed a great deal in the last couple of centuries. Again, there may be people who think it’s a bad thing but nonetheless it’s a gold mine for potential translators (a more apt comparison might be the silver mines of Laurion, where the Athenians sent convicted criminals to work themselves to death — but I digress). The fact is that a great translation in 1889 will have a hard time finding an audience today. The assumed readers of yesteryear all had different expectations and different tastes; a work which satisfied them will have a hard time satisfying most of us. There was a time when this was the state of the art in translating the Odyssey:

> Such speech they chang'd: when in the yeard there lay
A dogge, call'd Argus; which, before his way
Assum'd for Ilion; Vlysses bred;
Yet stood his pleasure then, in little sted;
(As being too yong) but growing to his grace,
Yong men made choise of him for euery Chace;
Or of their wilde Goats, of their Hares, or Harts.
But, his King gone; and he, now past his parts;
Lay all abiectly on the Stables store,
Before the Oxe-stall, and Mules stable dore,
To keepe the clothes, cast from the Pessants hands,
While they laide compasse on Vlysses Lands:
The Dog, with Tickes (vnlook't to) ouer-growne.

Here’s the same, from 20 years ago:

> As they were speaking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised his head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Odysseus had bred before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any enjoyment from him. In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when they went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his master was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full of fleas

There’s a lot of social and literary history between those two! And don’t think the first is just some hack job: that’s the edition of George Chapman, the one that inspired Keats’s [On First Looking into Chapman's Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_First_Looking_into_Chapman%27s_Homer):

> Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
Round many western islands have I been
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne;
Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:

Interestingly, Keats himself was reacting against a different translation, a much more “modern” (in 1816) and popular one: Pope’s rococco version from 1725. Chapman’s craggier language appealed to Keat’s Romanticism far more than Pope’s drawing-room-and-knee-britches version. But no less an authority than Dr. Samuel Johnson pronounced Pope’s Iliad to be the finest translation of _anything_  ever done. [It is, truth be told, very good.](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/01/books/on-reading-pope-s-homer.html)

There’s clearly a lot of room for disagreement, and not just on subjective grounds.

I love Chapman but I don’t spend a lot of time reciting English verse out loud. My great-great-great-grandparents (had they spoken English) would have had a far easier time with Chapman than I do because their ears had would have been practiced in poetic meter and the grammatical sleights of hand that you need to achieve it. I, on the other hand, just read words on the page — thus I’m not that great at scanning back three or four lines to remember who’s the actual subject of the sentence at hand. In another context, I am of course deeply indebted to the [Loeb’s Classical Library](https://www.loebclassics.com/), but many of the translations there are extremely tiresome to anybody who did not grow up on healthy doses of clunky 19th century Big Idea prose or perhaps too much Sir Walter Scott. In 1911 they may have simply sounded suitably “archaic” and thus laudably classical; nowadays they sound like the unholy spawn of a Renaissance Faire and a mutual fund prospectus. Audiences matter.

Plus new audiences mean new concerns as well as new aesthetics. The latest translation of the Odyssey, for example, [made a splash by refusing to use any word except “slave” for the various kinds of unfree people in the Homeric world](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Emily-Wilsons-new-translation-of-Homers-Odyssey-use-the-term-slave-173-times-when-Robert-Fagles-translation-used-that-term-only-18-times). It might or might not be a translation for the ages but its certainly a legitimate idea for the author to try force audiences into confronting that fact. It’s easy to see how all sorts of modern issues can inform a translation in ways that simply would never have occurred to earlier translators. That does not mean we’ve “surpassed” older readings — just that new ones can bring a fresh lens to old material.

I’d strongly recommend anybody interested in “best” translations to ponder this New Yorker piece by Daniel Mendelsohn: [Englishing the Iliad: Grading Four Rival Translations](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/englishing-the-iliad-grading-four-rival-translations). It’s a great working example of how much detail can be packed into a single passage, and why “best” is such an elusive quantity over time.
