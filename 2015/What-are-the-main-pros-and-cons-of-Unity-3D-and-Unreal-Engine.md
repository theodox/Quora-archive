On the macro level: 

Unity makes a good analogy for a standard PC: it's open, very flexible, and easily adapted to a lot of uses. It's also got a big supporting ecosystem -- the app store, good educational material, and huge and active user community. It's also got a C# / managed code tool chain, which makes it much easier to develop and support new tools and workflows.

UE4 is a better analog for a fancy custom workstation. It has better performance and is more highly optimized for what it does (which is primarily small-world, first person view games). The cost of that better performance is a more that it's more complex under the hood and there are more assumptions about what you'll want to do. If your task is close to what UE wants to do, it's hard to beat; if you're trying to manhandle it into a job it was not designed for it will be pretty punishing.

They're both great. The top end performance of UE is better, though Unity's is pretty good. Many traditional programmers find the de-centralized, 'where' my main loop' architecture of Unity very unsettling, but people who aren't steeped in C++ tradition seem to like it more.
