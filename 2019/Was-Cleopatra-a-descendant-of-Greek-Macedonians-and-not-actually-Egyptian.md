She has one of the more well known family trees in antiquity, and she is ultimately descended from Alexander’s general [Ptolemy I](https://www.ancient.eu/Ptolemy_I/), a Macedonian nobleman

Here is here background from the ancient sources:

You’ll notice that there are quite a few brother-sister marriages in the family tree — the Ptolemies took great pains to keep the crown inside the royal family. There were really only 3 Greek-speaking ‘superpowers’ during this period (the empire of the Ptolemies in Egypt, that of the Seleucids in Syria, and the kingdom of Macedon in Greece). The Ptolemies may have shied away from marrying any of their nominal ‘equals’ for fear of setting up a dynastic claim that their enemies could have used. All of these kingdoms suffered from periodic wars about succession; keeping the family tree tightly trimmed was supposed to help reduce that risk. Unfortunately it didn’t work very well: Cleopatra herself went to war against her brother [Ptolemy XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XIII_Theos_Philopator) and her sister [Arsinoe IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsinoe_IV_of_Egypt) at different times.

__Caveats__ 

Because the last two generations of the Ptolemaic kingdom were something of a soap opera — featuring coups, counter-coups, assassinations and betrayals — there are two “asterisks” in the chart above.

There is a theory that Cleopatra’s grandmother — listed in this chart as Berenice III — is actually an otherwise un-named Egyptian concubine. It is true that the written sources do not explicitly name Berenice III as the mother of Cleopatra V; they don’t mention the name of Cleopatra V’s mother at all. However that’s all we can be sure of — the claim that the real mother is Egyptian is based primarily on the belief that a skeleton found in Syria is that of Cleopatra VII’s sister, Arsinoe IV, and that the skeleton shows “African” characteristics.[ It’s not a strong case](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-inappropriate-for-a-white-actress-to-play-Cleopatra-since-she-was-Egyptian/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=73e98f4e&srid=zLvM) for a number of reasons — above all, both our Cleopatra (VII) and her father, Ptolemy XII were extremely controversial figures who attracted a lot of hostile commentary, and yet the charge of illegitimacy is not recorded in ancient sources which otherwise show no hesitation about calling names. Since this idea rests primarily on the a century-old archaeologist’s guesses about the race and identity of an otherwise nameless skeleton, it’s pretty dubious.

The other hesitation is the identity of Cleopatra VII’s mother. We are sure that her older sister Berenice IV was the daughter of [Cleopatra V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_V_of_Egypt), and we assume that the other royals of her generation were as well. For fans of the “Egyptian Cleopatra” hypothesis however this hesitation cuts both ways — if we assume that there are other unnamed mothers in that last Ptolemaic generation, there’s no guarantee that Arsinoe IV and Cleopatra VII actually shared a mother in any case. Once again, there aren’t contemporary allegations of illegitimacy. So, for the same reasons, the family tree above is the one that most historians use.
