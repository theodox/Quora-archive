If it were an undergrad paper, think I’d give it a B-. If it were really well written, it might rise to a B, but I haven’t been able to find an English transcript. As a serious military man, Zhukov certainly deserves a listen — he’s not just a crank. The theory does offer an interpretation of the most prominent evidence which makes a certain amount of sense.

So, it’s worth discussing.

On the other hand I don’t think it pass muster as professional history — at least not without being loaded down with a lot of qualifications. The problem with the Zhukov thesis is that it requires basically saying, “I know what the sources say — but the sources are lying!”

That’s something that professionals avoid whenever possible, because the [source material is the center of gravity in historical research](https://www.quora.com/A-Quoran-archaeologist-historian-argues-there-is-no-textual-evidence-for-a-Christian-theological-tradition-in-the-West-prior-to-the-life-of-Alcuin-735-804-CE-and-that-earlier-Christian-history-is-a-fiction-Is-there/answer/Steve-Theodore?share=f82d439c&srid=zLvM). You aren’t obligated to believe everything the sources say — everybody knows they are often biased and often incomplete. But the range of things that might be possible if you dismiss them out of hand is infinite: you can’t have fruitful discussions if you simply get to set aside evidence you don’t like. That’s a fact the historical profession generally learned in the late 19th century after a long flirtation with simply wishing away evidence that wasn’t congenial… and one which civilians have discovered all over again since the rise of the internet.

Here follows a longish examinations of what Marshal Zhukov would have needed to consider to up his grade and to avoid the accusation of simply refusing to believe the sources.

__Archaeology__ 

To really make the case strongly, you’d want some positive evidence. Ideally archaeological evidence would make it clearer — say a string of mass graves where the evidence showed Indian victors interring Macedonian dead, or a cache of Greek weapons in armor that looked like an Indian victory monument. On the other hand there’s also the chance that archaeology could undermine the Zhukov thesis. If the remains of [Alexandria Bucephalous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Bucephalous), [Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaea,_Punjab), or [Alexandria on the Indus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_on_the_Indus) are ever conclusively identified, that would demonstrate that Alexander was at leisure to found cities after the battle on the Hydaspes. Obviously, civic planning is an odd hobby for a shattered and fleeing army, so finding something unambiguous would lay this debate to rest once and for all.

Another possible archaeological proof would be the altars which Alexander is [said to have erected](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D21) along the Hyphasis river — the site of the (alleged) mutiny and the furthest extent of his travels. If one of those were to turn up it would strongly suggest that that traditional account is correct: beaten armies generally do not sit around waiting for the stonemasons go finish carving inscriptions before fleeing their conquerors.

However, all that waits on the arbitration of the shovel.

__Alternate sources__ 

Lacking archaeology, a contemporary Indian source describing a victory on the Hydaspes, or a victory monument with an inscription by Porus, would certainly help make a revisionist case. However, none have been found. Conflicting original sources always help to sharpen the picture. Of course, any textual evidence (on paper or carved in stone) has to be treated with equal suspicion on all sides: a defeated Indian king would have just as much reason to spin his loss into a victory as Alexander would. Still having a contrasting source would help a great deal to clarify matters. Unfortunately there aren’t any known non-Greek sources that cover the issue. An inscription or something might turn up, but until it does we don’t have much to work with.

The closest thing we have to an Indian version of these events are the traditions about the great strategist [Chanakya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanakya), who is said to have helped Chandragupta Maurya to overthrow Alexander’s governors in the Indus Valley after Alexander’s death.

That’s a story which only makes sense if Alexander had left an intact system of alliances and garrisons behind him (a topic we’ll revisit below).

__The wider context__ 

Lacking contrasting Indian sources, our main remaining avenue for investigation is the larger picture in the surviving Greek sources. When one source is in question you try to see how well it fits with other (ideally, unconnected) evidence. If Zhukov tried to do that, I have not heard of it — as I said, the text of his remarks does not seem to be available in English. However given the context — which I’ll talk about below — I’d be surprised if it included an exhaustive review of sources besides Plutarch and Arrian. Zhukov was not a classics scholar.

Here are some of the salient points to consider when looking at the larger context of the battle on the Hydaspes.

__1: Alexander’s monuments__ 

The usual recap of the battle between Alexander and Porus tends to focus on the _immediate_  aftermath — one of the key arguments for a Porus victory is the story of Alexander’s chivalrous treatment of Porus right after the fighting stopped. However there’s more to consider. The traditional account, as we’ve said, goes on to talk about Alexander’s monuments along the Hyphasis (that is, the Beas). They have not been found by archaeologists — but as we’ve said, should they turn up they’d provide powerful support for the traditional account.

We don’t have archaeology, but it happens there are two literary references which do suggest that Alexander’s monuments were still visible two or three centuries after the event. Philostratus, in his _Life of Apollonius of Tyana_ , [describes a monument to Alexander and Porus on the site of the Hydaspes battle, and reproduces an inscription on one of those altars along the Hyphasis.](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/philostratus-life-of-apollonius/philostratus-life-of-apollonius-2.41-43/?#%A742) Writing a little earlier, probably around the year 75 or so, Plutarch also reports that [the altars were still standing in his day](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243%3Achapter%3D62%3Asection%3D4) and local kings still offered sacrifices there.

This is highly suggestive — but not conclusive. On the plus side we have two writers, not clearly using a shared source, who both claim that Greek monuments were still visible east of the Hydaspes in the first century. Plutarch does not cite a source, however, and the _Life of Apollonius_ includes a lot of wonder-stories, so the value of these testimonies comes at something of a discount. Ancient history is not about ‘proof’ and ‘disproof’, it’s about relative probability. These accounts are useful supporting evidence but not more than that.

__2: The two Peithons__ 

If you only focus on the famous battle, you might the fairly detailed descriptions in Arrian of the governmental arrangements Alexander left behind. The details there — and they way they dovetail with other parts of this history of Alexander’s successors — provide a useful way to get at the reliability of the traditional story Alexander in India.

Perhaps the best example of how this works are the interlocking story of two Macedonian generals, [Peithon son of Agenor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peithon_(son_of_Agenor)) and (confusingly) [Peithon son of Crateuas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peithon)

Peithon son of Agenor was the man that Alexander is said to have left as governor of the lower Indus when the bulk of the army marched home. A second general, [Philip son of Machatas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_(son_of_Machatas)), was created satrap (= governor) of the upper Indus watershed — though before Alexander left he was killed by his own troops and replaced by another general named Eudamas. In the traditional version Alexander’s Indian ally [Taxiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxiles) was paired with Eudamas on the upper Indus and Porus was paired with Peithon.

If Alexander really fled from the Hydaspes in disarray, we’d expect not to find any further evidence of these ephemeral appointments (Peithon was actually appointed in the year after the battle with Porus in the traditional account — another strange outcome of a terrible defeat).

Again, it would be nice to have archaeological confirmation. The short-lived Philip was supposed to be the founder of Alexandria-on-the-Indus (probably modern [Uch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uch)), allegedly to help Alexander fit out his fleet to journey downriver to the sea. If we found clear evidence of his dockyard and supply dumps, that would be a strong argument for the traditional account.

Lacking that, we have to look at the literary record. Are there further mentions of Alexander’s Indian satrapies? Or did they disappear in the chaos following Porus’ victory?

The literature offers several mentions of what happened to the Indian domains. More importantly, it does so in contexts where the motive of disguising a battlefield defeat does not really apply, since the key events are some year’s after Alexander’s death.

After Alexander died in Babylon in 323, Peithon son of Crateuas was appointed satrap of Media, in modern Iran. This was a plum appointment, one of the most strategically and economically vital parts of the empire. Predictably, his fellow Macedonian generals feared and distrusted him. One incident stands out in connection with the state of Alexandrine India. In late 323 or early 322, [the sources say](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/diodorus/the-revolt-of-the-greek-settlers/), this Peithon was tasked by the shaky central government with intercepting a large group of Greek soldiers who had deserted their posts in the “Upper Satrapies” — Gandara, Bactria and India — and headed for home when they heard of Alexander’s death. This was a large, organized group: Diodorus puts it at 23,000 men.

This suggests that in 322 there was still a significant presence out east; but because of the vagueness of the terminology its hard to be sure that these veterans came from India and not from, say, Bactria. In any case Peithon son of Crateuas tried to cut a deal with these Greeks, because he was aiming at improving his own position. However the central government had anticipated this, and some of the troops he was given to quell the revolt had secret orders to massacre the mutineers instead. The rest of the Macedonian high command didn’t want 20,000 veterans joining Peithon’s army.

The story illustrates the levels of paranoia that were starting to infect the upper ranks of the Macedonian army after Alexander’s death. But, because the terminology here is vague, this is only weak evidence for the persistence of Alexander’s satrapies in the east.

It does however set the stage for a more important piece of evidence.

The [partition of Triparadisus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Triparadisus) in 321 was a desperate effort to keep Alexander’s empire from fracturing completely. The various Macedonian factions hammered out a power sharing deal that was supposed to keep the empire as a unit — though as things turned out it provided the blueprint for the generation of warfare that was to follow.

For our purposes the important clue here is that the traditional accounts all describe the Macedonians of 321 continuing to make appointments in the Indus valley.

> The country of the Parapamisians was bestowed upon Oxyartes, the father of Roxane; and the skirts of India adjacent to Mount Parapamisus, on Peithon the son of Agenor. As to the countries beyond that, those on the river Indus, with the city Patala (the capital of that part of India) were assigned to Porus. Those upon the Hydaspes, to Taxiles the Indian.

So here is Peithon son of Agenor, still in India in 321 — five years after the battle on the Hydaspes and still working with Porus and Alexander’s ally Taxiles.

Is that more propaganda? If it its, it’s incredibly elaborate: four years later, in 317, Peithon son of Crateuas reappears, this time allied with [Eumenes of Cardia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumenes), Alexander’s former secretary who had found a flourishing second career as a warlord. Once again, the other generals rallied around to stop him — including, this time, Peithon son of Agenor who _marches west from India_ .

Peithon of Media and Eumenes were defeated. As a reward for his support Peithon son of Agenor which landed him a far superior assignment as satrap of Babylon — an office held from 315 to until his death in 312. Clearly, the troops he brought with him from India were a powerful enough force that his support was worth a serious buyout.

Of course, this was also a critical weakening of Alexander’s old Indian provinces — pulling a large force away from the frontier to fight in civil disputes rendered Macedonian India far more vulnerable. It’s no coincidence that Chandragupta Maurya’s campaigns against Alexander’s territories are usually believed to start around the year 315. The Latin historian [Trogus](http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte15.html), writing around the time of emperor Augustus, says this about Seleucus Nicator, who founded the Seleucid empire out of the ruins of Alexander’s eastern possessions in 305:

> [Seleucus] next made an expedition into India, which, after the death of Alexander, had shaken, as it were, the yoke of servitude from its neck, and put his governors to death. The author of this liberation was Sandrocottus [= Chandragupta Maurya] who afterwards, however, turned their semblance of liberty into slavery; for, making himself king, he oppressed the people whom he had delivered from a foreign power, with a cruel tyranny.

That’s perhaps an unfair description of Chandragupta’s achievements, but it is clear evidence that Macedonian garrisons and generals were still around after Alexander’s death. And — unlike descriptions of Alexander’s behavior to Porus on the battlefield it’s not subject to the same political pressure that might try to protect Alexander’s reputation. It is, after all, a concession of defeat.* It also lines up fairly well with traditional Indian accounts of Chandragupta Maurya and Chanakya overthrowing Alexander’s garrisons in the Indus Valley.

So, the traditional account of Alexander’s campaign __can’t be read in isolation__ . It has a number of important cross-linkages with other, reputable stories about subsequent events which all make no sense if Alexander had barely escaped from India with his life. Since Alexander himself was dead before any of these accounts were set down, and no single authority arose to replace him, it’s hard to see who would have either the motive or the means to coordinate such a huge rewriting of ten years of turbulent history to disguise a single defeat thousands of miles away. Plenty of other unflattering stories about Alexander survived those years and are part of our common sources; it’s hard to see why this one would be special.

__Whose agenda?__ 

The core of the Zhukov thesis is that the story Alexander’s supposed victory on the Hydaspes followed by the mutiny on the Hyphasis is really a piece of propaganda covering a catastrophic defeat. This is an idea that might have a particular appeal to a marshal of the Soviet Union.

Zhukov — whose career, after all, was made under Josef Stalin, in an atmosphere where propaganda permeated every aspect of life — may very well have assumed that a similarly totalitarian atmosphere formed the backdrop of the ancient sources. He probably also could not bring himself to believe that Porus and Alexander’s post-battle relationship was anything but a lie. Zhukov was, after all, the hero of a 20th century total war — a struggle to the death in which chivalry and generosity toward defeated opponents were utterly incomprehensible ideals. And of course tales of a mutiny probably stuck him as bizarre: in his own armies, deserters and malcontents were shot out of hand.

Against that background you can see how he would be skeptical of what seems like a charming fable. However the line between “interesting take on this passage” and “valid historical argument” is very wide, and I’ve never seen any evidence that the steps a professional would take to try to validate such a novel reading were really part of Zhukov’s plan.**

In any case, Zhukov’s reading of the sources does not really seem like an abstract exercise in historical speculation. The “Zhukov thesis” was delivered as a speech to cadets at the Indian Military academy in 1957 — during a state visit at the height of India’s post-colonial flirtation with the Soviet Union. It’s no accident that he chose to say “Alexander suffered a greater setback in India than Napoleon in Russia” — how better to flatter the nationalist sentiment of his audience while reminding them of Russia’s anti-colonialist credentials? The effectiveness of this rhetorical stroke can easily be seen in the universal popularity of this reading among nationalist circles in India and Pakistan today. Perhaps it will come as no surprise that it is still also popular in [Russia’s semi-official media](https://www.rbth.com/blogs/2013/05/27/marshal_zhukov_on_alexanders_failed_india_invasion_25383).

__TLDR__ 

As an interesting spur for discussion (albeit one with a pretty blatant political subtext) the Zhukov thesis is worth talking about — even if only because it forces some close attention to the sources.

As an actual history of events, it’s not very strong. None of the supplementary evidence brought forward here is beyond critique, of course — but to establish this case these are the _kinds_  of evidence we’d need to see. “It doesn’t seem right to me that an enemy would be so generous after a battle” is an interesting place to start investigating; without a bunch of extra labor, however, it’s just an interesting, but unsupported opinion.

B- for an undergrad; C for a grad student.

_Zhukov demonstrates his experience in 1957 India_ 



* There’s a secondary debate in the history of this period concerning the relations between Chandragupta and Seleucus. Folks who follow the views of Zhukov about Alexander and Porus also tend to say that Chandragupta defeated Seleucus and made peace with him on victor’s terms. But that’s a separate discussion

** Zhukov apparently ascribed the origin of his theory to [E. A. Wallis Budge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._A._Wallis_Budge) … most famous as an Egyptologist, but also a translator of both Syriac and Ethiopian versions of the [Alexander romance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_romance). The Romance is a fun read — but it’s the least reliable of all the texts regarding Alexander’s careers. I’ve never been able to find a quote from Budge that actually repeats this Zhukov argument; it’s not clear if this is confusion or simply the provision of a respectable-sounding footnote that nobody is expected to check.
