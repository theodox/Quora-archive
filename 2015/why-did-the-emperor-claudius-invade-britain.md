To the extent that boring old economics played a role, the fact that Britain was well known as a good source of [tin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_sources_and_trade_in_ancient_times) probably factored pretty large. British tin was known to the Phoenicians (and thus the Carthaginians) and probably also through trade in Gaul. Tin is was very valuable in the Roman era because it's an important element in turning copper into bronze, which was a key workaday metal. British tin made big inroads into the Roman world, with Britain being the most important source in the empire by the 3rd century. 

The immediate reasons -- as almost always happened with Roman frontiers -- were unstable politics in the various client states. Once the Romans picked a few favorites and made them official Roman clients, it was mostly a matter of time until a disputed succession or a coup triggering some kind of Roman intervention. The Romans had client kings in Britain from at least the time of Caesar; Caesar claimed, at least, that the Britons had supported the [Belgae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgae) and [Veneti ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneti_(Gaul))against him during his conquest of Gaul -- that may be true or may be a pretext. In any case there were periodic excuses for intervention after that, since [Caesar's invasions of Britain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_invasions_of_Britain) did not succeed but did create Roman clients to whom the empire was obliged on some level. The eventual successful invasion under Claudius was nominally intended to re-instate the deposed king [Verica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verica) .
 
In general I usually suspect Roman motives have more to do with strategy and politics than economics, but in this one case I do tend to think the mineral resources played a big role: the number of would-be invasions (3 planned under Augustus and another under Caligula before Claudius) makes it seem like maybe this was an unusual case. Here's an interesting passage from Strabo, writing some time between AD 18-30



> At present, however, some of the chieftains there, after procuring the friendship of Caesar Augustus by sending embassies and by paying court to him, have not only dedicated offerings in the Capitol, but have also managed to make the whole of the island virtually Roman property. Further, they submit so easily to heavy duties, both on the exports from there to Celtica and on the imports from Celtica (these latter are ivory chains and necklaces, and amber-gems and glass vessels and other petty wares of that sort), that there is no need of garrisoning the island; for one legion, at the least, and some cavalry would be required in order to carry off tribute from them, and the expense of the army would offset the tribute-money; in fact, the duties must necessarily be lessened if tribute is imposed, and, at the same time, dangers be encountered, if force is applied.


This sounds like an argument against intervention, in particular against an economic justification for intervention. We don't however know much about the context (among other things, Augustus was still the victor in a recent and bloody civil war: you did not want to be too open about disputing his judgements!) but it might reflect a contemporary Roman discussion that does not otherwise make it into our records. Of course there's this, in Tacitus somewhat later, speaking of Ireland:



> One of the petty kings of the nation, driven out by internal faction, had been received by Agricola, who detained him under the semblance of friendship till he could make use of him. I have often heard him say that a single legion with a few auxiliaries could conquer and occupy Ireland, and that it would have a salutary effect on Britain for the Roman arms to be seen everywhere, and for freedom, so to speak, to be banished from its sight.


which sounds like traditional politics and power imperialism with no economic motives in sight.
