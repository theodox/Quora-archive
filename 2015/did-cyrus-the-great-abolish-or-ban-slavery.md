The claim that Cyrus banned slavery is an exaggeration, based on a misreading of one particular text.

[The Cyrus Cylinder](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=327188&partId=1), which is the source of this idea, does not actually mention slavery per se at all. [There is abundant evidence for slavery within various parts of the later Persian empire](https://www.quora.com/Why-didnt-Persians-practice-slavery-through-history/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=48ef05bd&srid=zLvM). Certainly slavery persisted in the Phoenician, Babylonian, Lydian, Carian and Greek territories of the Persian empire. We have almost no first-hand texts written by Persians in the Achaemenid period — but [at least one of that handful is all about the writer’s staff of slaves.](http://arshama.classics.ox.ac.uk/downloads/Tuplin-Introducing-Arshama.pdf) Herodotus tells many stories about Persians with slaves (for examples that Xerxes had a slave whose only job was to remind him to take vengeance on the Athenians). No record from any contemporary civilization actually says “Persians don’t have slaves.” Freeing all of the slaves in such a vast territory would have been an epochal event and we would have some record of it.

Here is the text on which this misapprehension is based.

Down in the bottom of the text Cyrus says:

> As to the inhabitants of Babylon, [they saw their] hearts con[tent] (because) [I abolished] the corvée which was against their (social) standing.

He’s talking not about slavery as an institution, he’s talking about the fact that (at least according to him) Nabonidus, the king of Babylon whom he overthrew, had imposed a corvee (ie, forced labor obligation) on the people of Babylon which Cyrus rescinded. It’s a good gesture, but it’s not the same thing as abolishing slavery. The corvee is mentioned twice in the Cylinder text — but both times it’s explicitly tied to Nabonidus. There’s no mention of “slavery” at all.

The other thing the text talks about is the return of many deportee populations. The Babylonian who Cyrus conquered, like the Assyrians before them, practiced mass resettlement of conquered nations as a way to break up troublesome rivals. The most famous but not the only example is the "Babylonian captivity" of the Jews. Cyrus did restore many of these deportees to their homelands, a well attested fact that shows up in numerous sources. This was brilliant politics, because it enabled the Persians to retain control of all the areas they took from the Babylonians while being seen as liberators, rather than conquerors -- this is one reason Cyrus shows up so favorably in the Bible and other non Persian sources.

The legal status of the deportees is hard to map onto familiar ideas like “free” and “slave” — clearly the Jewish community in Babylon, for example, included people of means. When the Cyrus allowed them to return, many elected to stay in Mesopotamia. On the other hand, under the Babylonians they were clearly forbidden to leave and seem to have been kept mostly in segregated communities.

In later Persian eras the Persians would practice this kind of deportation themselves — for example, thousands of Egyptians were sent to Susa to perform construction labor under Cambyses. So even if you want to read the cylinder’s reference to returning deportees as “abolition”, slavery was re-established by Cyrus’ son.

There’s a roundup of contemporary evidence for the existence of slavery in the Achaemenid empire [here.](https://www.quora.com/Why-didnt-Persians-practice-slavery-through-history/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=48ef05bd&srid=zLvM)
