# What was the first bilingual inscription in the history of the World? Jennifer Finn ("GODS, KINGS, MEN… Ars Orientalis 41 (2011): 219) calls the Persian Emperor, Darius I's trilingual inscription "innovative." It made me wonder. Any ideas?

There’s quite a significant corpus of multilingual inscriptions from the various cuneiform languages: since effective use of cuneiform involved a mix of ideographic and phonological writing, many scribes were conversant with more than one of the many languages recorded in cuneiform.

There’s a large amount of Sumerian-Akkadian language learning material. Assyrian and Babylonian scribes preserved the Sumerian language for religious and legal purposes. However these aren’t really “inscriptions” in the sense of texts created for public display. The oldest known bilinguals date to the [Akkadian empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire) (roughly, 2330–2150 BC) which used Akkadian as it’s spoken language but retained Sumerian for religious and legal purposes.

Ugarit (near Ras Shamra in modern Syria) was an entrepot for a number of regional languages: it sat on between the Semitic speakers to the south, Luwian and Hittite to the north, and Akkadian to the east. It produced a number of bilinguals in various combinations of these languages. Among it’s other treasures is a trilingual school text (again, not quite an “inscription”) in Sumerian, Akkadian, and Hurrian.

Jumping forward half a millennium or so, a neat example of a multilingual public inscription is the [Çineköy inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87inek%C3%B6y_inscription) from southern Turkey — it’s bilingual in hieroglyphic Luwian and Phoenician. It appears to be the first text to use “Syria” (_SU-RA/i_ in the text_)_  as an exonym for “Assyria.”

In the complex world of the Achaemenid empire, multilingual inscriptions crop up in more than just the royal tombs and palaces. A very interesting example of Achaemenid complexity comes from [Xanthos ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthos)in ancient Lycia, modern Turkey — an area which was conquered by the Persians in the middle of the 6th century BC but which was already a multicultural mix before being incorporated into the vast new empire. The Xanthos Obelisk is trilingual in [Lycian](https://omniglot.com/writing/lycian.php), Greek, and a more obscure Anatolian language known as Milyan. It doesn’t reproduce the same text in all three languages — but, interestingly, the Greek is done in the style of a contemporary Greek epigram and the Milyan is a translation of the Greek poem.

Around the same time the same town offers a different trilingual inscription, known as the [Letoon Trilingual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letoon_trilingual) since it was part of shrine to Leto. This one is in Greek, Lycian and Aramaic — the last being the standard government script of the western half of the Persian empire. This one is clearly borrowing contemporary Greek practice: it uses the permanent medium of stone as a way of reinforcing a legal assignment of rights (in this case, the establishment of a new priesthood with tax exempt status) but its interesting that the authors felt it necessary to make their point in three languages at the same time. This one is almost certainly later than Darius’ royal inscriptions, however.



All that adds up to it not being very likely that merely having multiple languages in a single inscription is what the author means by “innovative.”

At a guess, it’s more likely that the reference is the Persian-language script that Darius’s engineers used: it was a [streamlined syllabic form of cuneiform](https://omniglot.com/writing/opcuneiform.htm) which appears to have been invented at one stroke to record the Old Persian language, which otherwise had no native written form. The Persian government generally used Elamite cuneiform in Mesopotamia and further east, and Aramaic in the western half of its domains. The Persian cuneiform is a nicely designed and efficient script, but it never really caught on outside of royal prestige inscriptions: the government continued to use Elamaite and Aramaic (and Greek and other local languages as well) and ordinary Persians appear to have used Aramaic in daily life.

Nonetheless it was an interesting initiative and certainly counts as innovative.
