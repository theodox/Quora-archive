This habit arose when educated English speakers were generally very literate in Latin.

Latin words morph, often quite considerably, depending on their grammatical function in the sentence. If you read a lot of Latin you’ll quickly run into the variations of a name like _Pompeius:_ depending on the context of the sentence it might be _Pompeium, Pompeio,_ and either _Pompeii_ or _Pompei._ To folks who read a lot of Latin, it becomes clear that “Pompeius” is only one facet of the idea, not the whole thing.

If you live with that concept in a large fraction of your reading life, a bit like:

> How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
That now on Pompeius’s basis lies along
No worthier than the dust!

The sight of _Pompeius’s_  will drive you a little crazy: your Latin brain is telling you “no! it’s _Pompei_ as a genitive!” Anglicizing by dropping the grammatically variable part of the name emphasized the immutable idea of the name and avoided the weirdness of seeing a grammatical subject being used as a possessive.

The modern habit of replacing these with the Latin proper names probably gets its impetus from the fact that very few people in the last two centuries or so are fluent enough in Latin to be bothered by the solecisms it creates.
