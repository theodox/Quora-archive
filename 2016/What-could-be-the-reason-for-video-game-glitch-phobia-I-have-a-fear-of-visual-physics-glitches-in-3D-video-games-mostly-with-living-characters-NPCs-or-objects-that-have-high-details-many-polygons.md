# What could be the reason for video game glitch phobia? I have a fear of visual/physics glitches in 3D video games, mostly with “living” characters (NPCs) or objects that have high details (many polygons).

Actually this accords fairly well with the theory of the [Uncanny Valley](http://www.terraforming.com/auti02.htm) — the idea that when a character is sufficiently realistic, failings that would be merely annoying or amusing in a low fidelity setting begin to trigger the mental reflexes that make us wary of disease, death, and irrational behavior in real life. A bunch of colored pixels don’t bother us —we’re usually pretty comfortable anthropomorphizing them and reading all sorts of humanity into their behavior:

On the other hand a far more realistic, physical depictions of a humans — the kind that fall into the ‘close but not quite’ category — freak a lot of people out:

This image — at least the face — is much more ‘human’ than those 32x32 pixel Marios but it bugs the heck out of me. And a corpse is as ‘human’ as you can get - but it’s not the sort of thing you’d want to hang around with.

It may also be that you react really strongly to cognitive dissonance — the unpleasant feeling you get when different sets of assumptions which all seem fine by themselves don’t add up. Glitches set some of your intuitions about the game world at war with others, and if that sensation is extremely strong for you, you could be labeling it as a phobia.
