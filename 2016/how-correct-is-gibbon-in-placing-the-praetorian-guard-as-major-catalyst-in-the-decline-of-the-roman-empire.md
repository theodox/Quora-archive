In one sense , at least, he’s quite correct — the Praetorians set the standard for palace coups and military putsches which defined far too much of Roman politics.

Of course that’s only a a superficial explanation. The praetorians merely reflected a long-standing trend in Roman politics and society away from civilian control of the military and towards military autocracy — a process which predates Augustus and Caesar by a century and which was driven by many forces outside the narrow realm of military and institutional arrangements which Gibbon tends to focus on. They crowned and toppled emperors because imperial politics took place in a vacuum: emperors and their challengers had to fear the army and the praetorians but not the power of the Senate or the People. If the civil institutions had been stronger the role of the guards would not have been so decisive.

Moreover the Praetorians were off the scene before the real climax of his own “decline and fall” drama. Constantine (no favorite of Gibbon’s!) disbanded the guard in 312 — abolishing the name and privileges but failing to end the fatal reliance of the empire on household troops of dubious loyalty. Eventually the Byzantines “solved” this particular problem by importing mercenaries ([Varangian Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varangian_Guard) are the most famous example) who were less prone to involving themselves in Roman politics.
