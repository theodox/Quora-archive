Moor comes from _Maurus,_  the Latin word word for people of North African descent. I think it's ultimately derived from Μαύρος, the Greek word for "black" but I'm not certain. 

Amor is from Latin _amor._  the -_or_  ending is common in abstract nouns, like _fervor_  (same as in English) or _sudor_ ('wetness') or _canor_  (music).
