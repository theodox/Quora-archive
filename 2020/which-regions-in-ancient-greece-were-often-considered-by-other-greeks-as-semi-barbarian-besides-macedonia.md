__Epirus__ and Macedon were frequently regarded as similar and as similarly dubious outposts of Greekness. __Aetolians__ and __Acarnanians__ had bad reputations for banditry and piracy and a primitive lifestyle which other Greeks disdained. Unlike their northern neighbors, even their worst enemies didn’t seem to find a way to tag them as “barbarians” in the literal sense — presumably their speech patterns weren’t as off-putting to Greek ears.

The Spartans had a low regard for __Arcadians__ — even though their Greek credentials were never in doubt, outside of Mantinea and Tegea a lot of Arcadia was thinly settled. A backwoodsy lifestyle, combined with a very archaic dialect, rendered the Arcadians a little dubious in the eyes of citified Greeks. Mantinea and Tegea were pretty conventional Greek states but their neighbors were happy to lump them into the same retrograde basket as their upland cousins. On the other hand in the Hellenistic era that image of rural simplicity became fashionable; many of the simpering shepherdesses and tame, non-threatening satyrs of later Greek poetry were supposed to be Arcadians.

__Elis__  in the northwestern Peloponnessus was also renowned for its gnarly dialect — though as the home of Olympia it was mostly a verbal outlier: the Elians were _barbarophones_  if not _barbaroi._ 

Among the islands, __Lemnos__ had a bad reputation both for piracy and for having a populace descended from Thracians. Eventually the Athenians “solved” both of those issues by taking the place over as a colony.

In __Ionia__ , there seems to have been some tension between Dorian Greeks and Ionians — Herodotus ([1.146](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/1C*.html)) makes a few passive-aggressive remarks about the Ionians’ willingness to intermarry with their Carian neighbors, and in a couple of passages actually contrasts “Ionians” and “Hellenes.” Despite using the Ionian dialect in his writings, Herodotus was a Dorian from Halicarnassus; his attitude might reflect different levels of xenophobia in different communities or it might just be a byproduct of local rivalries. The popularity of Ionian literature and the outsized influence of Ionian thinkers in the Greek world helped support the Ionians’ claims to Hellenism. On the other hand their military ineptitude and frequent subjection to non-Greek powers made many Greeks regard them as “soft” or “effeminate” like the other inhabitants of Asia Minor.

__Pamphylia__ in Asia Minor and __Cyprus__  were linguistic throwbacks — their brands of Greek were even closer in most ways to the language of Mycenae than that of Arcadia. Cyprus didn’t even start [using the Greek alphabet ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_syllabary)until around the time of the Peloponnessian war. Thus, Cyprus occupies an ambiguously Greek place in Aeschylus and Euripides, for example. And Pamphylia had a native language alongside its old-fashioned Greek; Arrian reports that some of those “Pamphylians” were originally Greek settlers who had adopted the native tongue. In the[ Acts of the Apostles](https://biblehub.com/niv/acts/2.htm) Pamphylian is one of the tongues heard by the crowd on Pentecost.

Over all, [‘barbarian’ was always a dubious word](http://www.palaeolexicon.com/Article/Show/6675871235486286148). It might mean someone who spoke no Greek — or just somebody whose usage or accent offended a particular Greek. It might instead mean somebody who lived a primitive lifestyle — a mountain bandit or a pirate king — though as a term of disparagement it might be a Greek whose tastes were not quite sophisticated enough.
