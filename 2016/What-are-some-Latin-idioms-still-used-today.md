For my money the most common ones are actually abbreviations: lots of people use p.s., _post scriptum_ for “written later” but there are a lot of crypto-Latin abbreviations that people don't even recognize for what they are.

___i.e___ _._ or _id est_ . Literally “it is” but used more or less for “which is to say…”

__e.g.__ , e_xempla grata_ , ‘for example”

__q.e.d.__ , _quod erat demonstrandum_ , “which has been shown”

__ca.__ , _circa_ , “around” or “roughly”

__c.v.__ , _curriculum vitae_ , “the course of life” — a resume.

Whether you are a __Ph.D.__  or “_philosophiae doctor_ ” (i.e., a teacher of philosophy) or an__M.A.__ , a _magister artium_  (master of arts), or even a humble__B.A.__  (_Baracus* artium_ , bachelor of the arts) you will still find more If you have a taste for old fashioned scholarship. There are a bunch of latinisims in the footnotes too, which date back to the Early Modern era when Latin was the international language of scholarship:

__vid. inf__ ., _vide infra_ , “ see below.”

__q.v.__ , quod vide “which (you can) see (here)”

__cf.__ , conferre, “compare”

__ibid.__ , _ibidem , “_ In the same place”

__loc. cit.__ , _loco citato_ , “in the place (already) cited.

__et seq.__ _, et sequentia_ , “and following”

__ff__ ., _folliis_  or__pp.,__  _paginae,_  for “pages” — the use of doubling in the abbreviation to indicate plurals goes back to medieval monasteries.

Of course there are more: eg: __etc.__ , _et cetera_ , “others too” and __i.a.__ , _inter alia,_ “among other things”…

_…ad nauseam,_  “until you are sick of them”



* Caveat (“let one beware”) : its really _Baccalaureatus_ , literally “crowned with berries” . B.A. Baracus is cooler, though, at least to us 80’s _relicts_ . Mostly I’m just making sure you're paying attention
