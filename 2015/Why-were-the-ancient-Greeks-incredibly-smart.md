What made them smart was what they were dumbest at. 

The great days of Greece were the period when they were incredibly disorganized: at war with each other and the outside world. They were politically fractious, terrible at compromise, and prone to treachery. We all remember Leonidas at Thermopylae -- we tend to forget that fellow Greeks led the Persians around the Spartan wall; we know how the Athenians invented democracy, but we tend to forget the many anti-democratic coups and conspiracies which punctuated Athenian history down to the end.

The paradoxical result was weak states and weak institutions, which forced them to argue. A lot. In public. In that time and place, this was unusual: most successful societies of the same time were hierarchical, with received opinions flowing down from the top -- the kings, the priests, the clan elders and so on. The shambolic disorganization of Greece, by contrast, meant that there was no source of authority to which you could appeal: it was necessary to hash things out by arguing. This tended to teach people how to argue: Philosophy (_philosophia)_ and political rhetoric (_sophistika)_ are near-cousins: to some degree politicians need concepts and frameworks to make their arguments sound like more than self interest, while the philosophers use the verbal tricks and logical cheats of the politicians to construct their ideas. "Natural philosophers," or as we would say _scientists_ , applied the same techniques of skeptical inquiry and combative explanation to the natural world that the philosophers and politicians used in public debates. 

In later centuries, as the Greeks' tendency to factionalism and disunion left them under the dominion of outside powers, the link between politics and abstract thought weakened. However the habit of analysis (Greek for _unravel_  or _untie)_ and argumentation remained a key part of Greek culture.
