Writing is fragile, and scrolls are particularly so: one of the reasons that codices (that is, bound books) replaced scrolls is durability. That transition took place between the first and fifth centuries, picking up speed over time.

As far as I know the only intact scrolls from the Roman period are actually the [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls), which were found as close to intact as one could hope:

They are of Roman date and extraordinarily well preserved, but of course they’re Roman literature only in the broadest possible sense.

The best preserved scrolls of actual Roman provenance aren’t nearly so readable:

_These are scrolls from Pompeii. We’re_ _[only just figuring out how to read them](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/science/more-progress-made-toward-learning-contents-of-herculaneum-scrolls.html?_r=0)_ _without destroying them_ 

We do have a quite lot of fragmentary scrolls. The Egyptian desert is a treasure trove for papyrus: the low humidity and low agricultural use have preserved a lot of material that would have perished anywhere else. The most interesting finds are actually from ancient garbage dumps: they reveal a lot about about daily life which is otherwise completely lost to us ([Life in Egypt Under Roman Rule](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Egypt-Under-Roman-Rule/dp/0198148720/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1465408092&sr=8-1&keywords=life+in+egypt+roman) is a great book on this). There are also a lot of manuscripts of high-culture subjects, including things we would otherwise have lost.

However the papyri are not usually found as intact scrolls. Probably the best preserved piece from the Roman period is the [Bankes Papyrus](http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Papyrus_114) in the British Museum, which is almost all of one book (that is, one scroll) of the Iliad:

More often, though, what we find looks like this:

Ironically we actually have many more intact scrolls from pre-Roman and pre-Greek Egypt: Since many Pharaonic scrolls were grave goods they were undisturbed - and because they were unreadable by everybody (including, after around the third century, by native Egyptians) they were not handled frequently or kept in libraries where fire, warfare, mice or careless readers could get at them.

If you want to see a really intact Roman book in particular, you’ll have to look at codices, not scrolls. One of the main reasons that codices replaced scrolls is that they are much less fragile and more survivable. This is a real (though “late”) Roman codex from around the year 400 (these are also parchment, rather than papyrus: another plus to longevity).
