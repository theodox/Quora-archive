# Did Roman/Byzantine plumbing extend to private homes? Did they have running water and toilets in the more expensive homes? Was there a sewer system? Were there courtyard fountains?

In the city itself water was a public benefit, open to all but (not unlike the grain dole) also controlled by the government for political purposes. Ordinary people had access to free water from public fountains, which were maintained at public expense. In well served neighborhood you might find a fountain every 50 or 100 yards. 

There was, however, a parallel private water system that covered much of the city using wells and rain-filled cisterns. It was quite similar to the hodgepodge or private water supplies in other pre-industrial cities. Private homes and businesses could use those traditional means for convenience (to avoid sending slaves off to queue up at the well every morning) or for industrial uses where bulk transport of water was too expensive -- one of the biggest uses for water was irrigating market gardens.

Some wealthy homes did have private water taps. These connected to a local sub-station or _[castella](http://www.romanaqueducts.info/castellaeintro/castellae.htm)_ _._  This was usually a symbol of being politically well connected: in Imperial times the emperor could grant water-rights to an individual, usually a member of the Senatorial aristocracy. This type of private water wasn't purchased -- there was no water bill -- but granted. The recipients did however have to pay for their own plumbing and hookups.

_This_ _[Roman inscription -- now lost](http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/waters/rebecca.html#concession)_ _-- is a record of private water lines. It notes not just customer's names but also times and amounts. For example the customer in the middle , Caius Julius Hymettus, gets two units worth of flow for four hours every day._ 

According to Frontinus, something like 50% of all Rome's aqueduct water was for public distribution, about 20% went to the well-connected recipients of imperial grants, and about 30% to private paying customers.

It appears there was a special tax on properties located near the fountains and castellae intended to help pay for the cost of upkeep: [Sextus Iulius Frontinus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/De_Aquis/text*.html), who ran Rome's water system under emperor Nerva, mentions tightening and regularizing the administration of that tax to raise and additional 250,000 _sestertii --_ if that is understood as a just the gains from enforcing the rules in place the system must been enormous, though its is not well documented otherwise. 

The charge on neighbors may also be a pragmatic recognition that many people living close to the aqueducts helped themselves to water by piercing the sides of the water-courses, or by bribing the administrators of a local _castella_ to let them tap in to the same private water supply as the well-connected: The spirit of the cable guy is an ancient given of human nature even if the technology changes. Water theft was a constant problem that was never solved by the authorities. Here's Frontinus (who was perpetually harassed by water thieves) again:

> [114.](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/De_Aquis/text*.html#2.114)[ ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/De_Aquis/text*.html#2.114)There is, besides, this intolerable method of cheating practised by the water-men: When a water-right is transferred to a new owner, they will insert a new ajutage in the reservoir; the old one they leave in the tank and draw from it water, which they sell. This practice especially, therefore, as I believe, should be corrected by the Commissioner; for this concerns not only the protection of the water itself, but also the maintenance of the reservoirs, which get to be leaky when they are often and unnecessarily tapped into.

> [115.](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/De_Aquis/text*.html#2.115)[ ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/De_Aquis/text*.html#2.115)The following mode of gaining money, practised by the water-men, is also to be abolished; the one called "puncturing." There are extensive areas in various places where secret pipes run under the pavements all over the City. I discovered that these pipes were furnishing water by special branches to all those engaged in business in those localities through which the pipes ran, being bored for that purpose here and there by the soâ€‘called "puncturers"; whence it came to pass that only a small quantity of water reached the places of public supply.

 In the provinces water service more likely to be a self-sustaining utility service which actually charged money: for example in [Pompeii](http://theplumber.com/pompeii-herculaneum/) the customers paid a monthly fee based on the size of their feed pipes. In more far-flung parts of the empire the customers were primarily the wealthy, Romanized elite-- locals of a lower social class probably made due, like many Romans, on wells and cisterns.
