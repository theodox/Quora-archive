Generally Gibbon is regarded now as a product of his times — he writes the kind of kings-and-battles history that we generally leave to specialists nowadays, and he does it from a standpoint that is firmly rooted in the prejudices of his time and place. He’s a brilliant writer, but he’s writing to make an ideological point. (More here in [Is it worthwhile, in this day and age, to read The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire?](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-worthwhile-in-this-day-and-age-to-read-The-History-of-the-Decline-and-Fall-of-the-Roman-Empire)).

In terms of modern works:

[How Rome Fell by Adrian Goldsworthy](https://amzn.to/2GqJLcz) is a good broad survey of the end of the west. His earlier work on Augustus — and the civil wars that helped him create the empire — gives him good insight into the unhappy tendency of late Romans to fight each other with more gusto than they fought the barbarian outsiders.

Maybe the most radical option is [Barbarian Tides by Walter Goffart](https://amzn.to/2pEWCOV), which offers a very interesting read of the whole period that emphasizes continuity rather than changes. The arguments in the book are pretty technical, but the overall picture of a late Antique world where the upper classes of Roman and non-Roman societies fused by a complex process of assimilation and cultural exchange is a very compelling alternative to the usual stereotype of shaggy hordes swelling out of the dark forests.

[The World of Late Antiquity by Peter Brown](https://amzn.to/2G8lPY3) is one of the best books on the kind of things that Gibbon was terrible at: recreating the social and private world, rather than the world of kings and generals. It gives a lot of insights into the changes in Roman society that drove and were driven by the changes in Roman governance in the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries. Anything by Peter Brown is a great look at the social and intellectual worlds of Late Antiquity.

[Corruption and the Decline of Rome](https://amzn.to/2I3LsKc), looks at the way in which the upper classes weakened the imperial state by siphoning off rights and revenues. It’s another fairly specialized work but one with a lot to say about how things really ran in late Rome — and how different it is from our marble and toga stereotypes.
