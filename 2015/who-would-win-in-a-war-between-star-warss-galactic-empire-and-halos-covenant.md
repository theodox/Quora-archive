While an interesting tactical proposition*, this question misses an important point.

The Covenant has __already__  met the Empire; indeed, the whole of Covenant culture is _nothing but a kind of cargo-cult effort to reconstitute the Empire_ .

Because the Empire is what the Covenant know as __the Forerunners__ .

If the two cultures met in person, it would be via _time-travel_ .

__The case__ 

We already know that the Forerunners are the ancestors of modern humans -- that's why John-117 can access the Halo devices. And we know that the Empire is, as the saying has it, a powerful galactic civilization from "A long time ago" which spread itself across uncounted lightyears: precisely the sort of thing which, millennia later, would become basis for the Covenant's superstitious worship of the Empire's remnants. Let's consider the xeno-archaeological evidence, by comparing our Imperial legends and records with those of the Covenant's extensive, multi-system search for Forerunner... that is, Imperial... relics.

__Go Big Or Go Home__ 

Perhaps the most striking aspect of Forerunner aesthetics, which finds its obvious match in the Empire's notorious fondness for expensive public works mega-projects, is _gigantism_ . Both the Empire and Forerunners alike possess incredibly advanced technologies; but rather than devoting their considerable talents to things like hand-held personal communications devices or nano-technology both cultures prefer to indulge in projects on a superhuman scale, from mile-high megacities to entire artificial planetoids and ringworlds.

_Coruscant (above) and The Library (below) both demonstrate the same taste for architectural bombast - and for avoiding efficient, inexpensive rectilinear shapes._

When cultures with force-fields and tractor beams remain committed to building enormous mechanical doors, some non-engineering factor is clearly at work. This has led some students to conclude that the Fore-Imperials evolved on a high gravity planet where massive over-engineering was a survival trait. In our records they clearly inhabit Earth-like worlds but their atavistic obsession with size may reflect a more Jovian origin.

Or, they may just be, you know, _overcompensating_ for something.

Both Imperial and Forerunner sites display an fondness for unsupported, cantilevered platforms rather than sane, well buttressed structures: a_jeu d'esprit_  of a heavy-world culture that enjoys flaunting its victories over mere gravity in a tactless (and expensive) fashion:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ffa74349799691f8fa0c695a5d18baae-c)

_You don't build like that unless you're trying to make a point._ 

__Angles, Angles everywhere__ 

On a related note, it's clear that both the empire and the Forerunners display an equally irrational aversion to right angles: doorways and windowsills in both cultures are almost always trapezoidal or hexagonal, where most cultures would be content with a plain old rectangle:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-134103cced12c75f35491a06f7ccd136-c)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5b0658500a2008eeb8b5860722ce0181-c)

This supports the theory that the Imperial humanoids originated on a high gravity planet where the extra support was useful. However it might also support the overcompensation theory as well, reflecting as it does an exaggerated form of 'manspreading.' In either case, however, this is another strong parallel demonstrating that the Empire was, in fact, the Forerunner culture.

__Blue Horizon__ 

Another important clue is the fact that known Forerunner sites -- and most recorded instances of Imperial interiors -- share the same color palette. The monochromatic interiors combined with cool blue-tinged lighting can hardly be a coincidence. Most known species see better at the red end of the visible light spectrum, but the Forerunners and the Imperials both seem to prefer their work environments heavily shifted towards the blue - perhaps a reflection of a gravitational blueshift on their massive planet of origin.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2ff3e095cc5ee62f158473bb335435cb-c)

This may also account for the puzzling lack of signage in both sets of installations: where most military and transportation infrastructure is crawling with text ("NO STEP", "HARD HATS MUST BE WORK AT ALL TIMES", "300 WORKING DAYS SINCE LAST DEATH STAR OBLITERATED") both Forerunner and Imperial sites seem strangely bare to us: acres and acres of gigantic walls with nary a name-plate or directions to the nearest restroom. However it's possible that their signage is shifted farther into the blue end of the spectrum than we can easily see: this may be a military readiness technique similar to the use of red lighting on submarines.

__Parallels multiply...__ 

And there's an ever-expanding grab-bag of other Forerunner/Imperial traits:

_Floating ball-shaped robots of dubious moral character:_

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a2855cfecdd8b3b12ad60a1b8d7324b2-c)

Improbable walking fortresses (the Scarab, of course, being scavenged technology), perversely vulnerable to melee weapons:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-74fd025dd88539b31a9c26105ab3b8c5-c)

_Could two different species independently evolve a walking fortress that could be defeated by a single individual on foot? What are the odds?_

and of course Greco-romanesque muscled armor:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-161f4777a4d01adb58071776ec059853-c)

In conclusion…

Finally, the clincher: the Empire and the Forerrunners share a remarkable -- indeed, a nearly _unique_  cultural trait. Alone among starfaring civilizations these two galaxy-spanning civilizations manage to conquer space without ever inventing the ___handrail___ , an elementary technology known to every other sentient species.

_Epic grandeur. Criminal negligence._ 

Opinion among xeno-archeologists is divided as to the reasons. It may be some kind of atavistic superstition (perhaps the Gods are expected simply seize anyone unwary enough to linger by the side of 5,000 meter deep airshaft) or it may represent a quirk of evolutionary biology. If the Forerunner/Imperials race possessed the same sort of inner ears as lemurs, a 50 story drop due to clumsiness would be so unthinkable that they felt no more need to guard against it than we feel the need to put up signs reminding people to breathe. In any event, this is such an evolutionarily unusual trait that it strongly supports the Empire > Forerunner hypothesis.

__However:__ 

The most potent objection to the Empire / Forerunner hypothesis is the somewhat non-human appearance of the Didact, the only living representative of the Forerunners:

However there are two things to keep in mind. First, there is a considerable time elapsed between our knowledge of the Empire and the creation of the Halos: millennia presumably must have passed between the paltry planet-killing power of the Death Star and the ultimate Technological Terror, the Halo array. So it's possible that the race continued to evolve, perhaps as part of the conflict against the Flood

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-34161763ac8010390b2c6fc44e7a773a-c)

_An early manifestation of the Flood parasite?_ 

However it is more likely that Didact's appearance simply owes more to the vicissitudes of life as a warrior.

Terrible things happen in space:

In conclusion, and to answer (at last) the original poster's question:
The Covenant -- whose entire culture, after all, is based on the veneration of Forerunner relics -- would be able to put these clues together as easily as I have. The realization would of course come as a terrible shock (as did the realization that the Forerunner technologies of the Halos responded to human DNA but not to their own). The difference is that the vision of living, functionioning Forerunner tech -- such as the appearance of a Super Star Destroyer in all its ineffable majesty, rather than crude little boxes like the _Pillar of Autumn_  -- would force them to confront the truth far more quickly than they did in the Halo series.

It's possible, however, that the Empire - despite it's reputation for xenophobia - would be smart enough to exploit the fanaticism and gullibility of the Covenant (or at least of remnants of Covenant orthodoxy), cutting a deal as they did with non-humans like Prince Xizor and Grand Admiral Thrawn.

_* From a military standpoint the most interesting aspect of the conflict is what happens when two militaries composed entirely of lunkheads who can't hit the broad side of a barn collide. The tactics would inevitably devolve into Napoleonic-style massed tactics (notably the leaders on both sides disdain firearms, preferring to lead in true aristocratic fashion with swords). My supposition is that the Empire would suffer serious command and control problems in a_ guerre de masse, _since it's troops are outfitted in utterly indistinguishable costumes. The Covenant, on the other hand, would be able to use its diverse silhouettes and colored rankings (_ gold Grunts, etc)_in much the same manner as the European generals of 1800 used their brightly costumed battalions._
