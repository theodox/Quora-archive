Not completely intact.

There is, however, a substantial fragment of one right at the foot of the Capitolino: the [Insula Dell’Ara Coeli.](https://www.turismoroma.it/en/node/1104)

It gives a pretty good idea of what the more substantial ones were like in terms of bulk. You can even take a kind of virtual tour, thanks to laser scans:



The same neighborhood includes a few other relics of Roman vernacular architecture but none are complete. Most were found during the Mussolini-era reconstruction of the neighborhood; it’s likely that many other examples are incorporated into the lower floors or basements of other Roman structures but it’s hard to get at them.

The best examples are actually at Ostia, Rome’s one-time port. There are a couple of substantial examples of the first couple of stories although it’s important to remember that there are probably three missing floors above what’s visible.
