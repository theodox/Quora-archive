None of them were at their historic peaks, and our ability to judge is somewhat limited by the lack of the kinds of data we’d like to have.

It matters a good deal _when_  in the third century you mean. Alexandria was founded late in the fourth century, while Carthage at that point was almost five hundred years old, and it had a vast trading empire all over the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts. 332 is the conventional date for the founding of Alexandria but serious urban growth did not necessarily begin right away: Alexander was busy polishing off the Persian empire and then gallivanting around India from 331 to 325 or so. So, in the earliest years of the century Carthage was probably still wealthier than the Egyptian upstart.

However both Carthage and Egypt saw serious ups and downs across the span of the third century. Carthage battled the Greeks of Syracuse in the late fourth century and Pyrrhus of Epirus in the third, losing both times; more importantly, the [First Punic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Punic_War) (264–241) marked a major setback for the city’s ambitions. In Egypt, on the other hand, the reigns of [Ptolemy II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_II_Philadelphus) (reigned 285 - 246) and [Ptolemy III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_III_Euergetes) (246 - 222) showed Ptolemaic Egypt at the zenith of its powers, with armies on the Euphrates and the shores of Asia Minor.

Both Egypt and Carthage lost their dominance of the seas in the latter half of the third century — Carthage after its defeat by Rome, and Egypt after the battle of Cos in 258. However Egypt’s abundant agriculture, large native supplies of gold, and privileged access to the rare spices of east Africa and Arabia provided a solid foundation of prosperity. Carthage’s territories, at the same point in time, were primarily a string of trading posts and maritime bases, which became harder to defend and to profit from after the first Punic War gave Rome the mastery of the western seas. It was only the loss of their maritime empire which encouraged the Carthaginians to invest in agriculture and manufacturing.

Both cities remained the focal points for trade in their respective areas, but since the east was generally richer and more populous than the west in this period, it’s highly likely that Alexandria had surpassed Carthage by the second half of the third century. Alexandria would go on to even greater heights in the future, once the sea route to India opened up in the first century BC. Carthage would spend much of the latter half of the century locked in another contest with Rome (218–201) ending in another defeat. Despite an amazing rebound after that contest Carthage would be destroyed by the Romans once and for all in 146.

Damascus was not close to its peak of prosperity in this period. Although it was much older than Carthage — it was at least two thousand years old — the major trading center of third century Syria was [Antioch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioch) rather than Damascus. Antioch and [Seleucia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucia)-on-the-Tigris were the great centers of the Near East in this period, with Damascus and Palmyra in the second rank. Seleucia would rival Alexandria for size and power well into the Roman era. The glory days of Damascus not come for another thousand years or so, when city became the seat of the Ummayad Caliphate.
