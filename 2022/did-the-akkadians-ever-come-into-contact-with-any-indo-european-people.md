Possibly, but it’s not certain. There are two candidates, but no slams-dunk certainties.

> Note: this is assuming the question is limited to the [original Akkadian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire) (24th - 22d centuries BC) and not to all Akkadian speaking states — in the later case the answer is an easy yes, and the list of candidates is too long to lay out easily.

Scholars are divided over the linguistic affinity of the [Gutians](https://www.worldhistory.org/Gutians/) who destroyed the Akkadian empire — in large part because we don’t have any Gutian texts or even vocabulary: our only evidence card personal names rendered in Akkadian cuneiform, which is not much to work with. However later Akkadian language texts use “Gutians” to refer to the [Medes](https://www.quora.com/Who-were-the-Medes/answer/Steve-Theodore) who did speak an Indo-European Iranic language so it’s not a terrible guess.

Another candidate group is the [Hurrians,](https://www.worldhistory.org/Hurrians/) who lived along the upper Euphrates and in the Taurus mountains, in what is today Syria. The Hurrians were sometime allies of the Akkadian empire, but again their linguistic affiliation is also debated; the language might be Indo-European but also might instead be Kartvelian or Caucasian. Eventually the Hurrian heartland became part of the kingdom of [Mitanni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitanni), which remained a Hurrian-speaking society but whose rulers bore distinctively Indo-European names and worshipped familiar Indo-European deities like [Mitra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitra), [Varuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varuna), and [Indra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra). The Mitanni period however dates from about the 16th century BC, so about 500 years after the fall of the original Akkadian empire. The Mitanni were familiar to the Akkadian-speaking Assyrians but probably not to the original successors of Sargon.

The two groups might both be I-E: much later, when Cyrus the Great was trying to legitimize his rule in Babylon, he boasted of having “made the land of Gutium and all the [Umman Manda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umman_Manda) bow in submission at his feet.” At least in contemporary Babylonian “Ummam-manda” is a vague term for barbarian peoples from the north, probably encompassing the Mitanni/Hurrian heartland. So its conceivable that the boast lumped two Indo-European groups together in a way that made sense to an Akkadian speaking audience — but conceivable is not the same thing as proven or even probable.
