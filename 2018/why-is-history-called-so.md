It’s derived from the Geek word ἱστορία_(historía)_  which means “researches” or “inquiries”.

[Herodotus, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus)a Greek writer from the 5th century BC, used ἱστορία to describe his book about the Persian wars, which is usually regarded as the first purpose-written history. He chose that term to emphasize that he had gone out of his way to get at the truth of past events, collecting evidence and comparing different versions, rather than simply passing on a received tradition about the past uncritically. For this he’s frequently described as the “father of history.”
