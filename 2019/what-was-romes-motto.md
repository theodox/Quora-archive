They didn’t really have one, at least not in the sense that the US has “E Pluribus Unum” or the Prince of Wales has “Ich Dien.”

A lot of people think that the answer is the famous __SPQR__ , which stands for _Senatus Populusque Romanus “_ The Roman Senate and People”.

However there’s no actual evidence of the phrase or abbreviation being used as either a piece of national “branding” or as an official motto. You will find SPQR on everything from manhole covers to fountains all over Rome — however those are mostly a remnant of Mussolini’s efforts to brand his own state as a continuation of ancient glories, or 18th century popes playing up their Roman credentials. Apart from coins, the arch of Titus and the arch of Constantine it’s not actually that common in actual ancient usage.*

The surviving examples almost all use SPQR to indicate a particular public action, usually in honor of an individual. That Augustan coin, for example, commemorates how the “Senate and People” bestowed a special honor on Augustus, indicated here as __CL.V,__ short for _clipeus virtutis_  or “the shield of virtue”, a bit of flattery which consisted of a big golden shield with an inscription congratulating the emperor on his courage, clemency, justice and piety to the gods:

In this example the inscription says, “The Senate and People of Rome gave to imperator Caesar, the son of the deified, etc etc”. SPQR is invoked to dress this up as a grateful society uniting to honor the emperor: in short, it’s a piece of political theater, not a bureaucratic formula or a piece of branding. Another famous “SPQR” example is the arch of Septimius Severus, which uses a wordier expression of the same idea. And this coin

refers to the honors conferred on Vespasian’s daughter [Domitilla,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domitilla_the_Younger) once again conveying the idea that the Senate and People united to honor the memory of the deceased imperial child. In other words, SPQR typically denotes a public honor conferred on an individual, usually an imperial individual. That’s why it’s almost guaranteed that those seal-rings with SPQR inscriptions which show up on Ebay (though not, you’ll notice, in museum catalogs) are fakes.

As an aside, you can find thousands of images like this one all over the internet:

however we’ve never found an intact Roman standard with the SPQR tag. The closest thing to a Roman standard that survives is this third century example from the Pushkin Museum in Russia:

and as you can see it has no lettering.



_*The phrase_ Senatus Populusque Romanus_shows up in Latin literature fairly early. However it does not show up in inscriptions or coins before the imperial period; whether that makes it some kind of imperial-era creation (the coin above dates from the time of Augustus, and is one of the earliest examples) or whether it just reflects accidents of survival is hard to know. The last ancient usage appears to be on coins of emperor Constantine — it may simply have seemed less important after that, since Constantine moved his capital to Constantinople and almost none of the subsequent emperors actually resided in Rome for long._
