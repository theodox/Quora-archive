There’s nothing secretive about it, just google “Perseus family tree” and you’ll have zillion images. Here’s a fairly simple one:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-beb4725e604eafb0e54de2537bacfbe9)

This one includes Nilos (very top right) and [Belos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belus_(Egyptian)), king of Egypt. Perseus, Heracles and so on are clearly listed as descendants of Danaus (usually said to be a king of Libya, that is, Africa) and Aegyptus (king — confusingly — of Arabia). Perseus’s wife [Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(mythology)), by the way, is an Ethiopian princess.*

This is Greek mythology 101: anybody who’s read the Iliad knows the Greek army at Troy called itself “Danaan” after Danaus.** In historic times, the kings of Sparta and Alexander the Great liked to emphasize their connection to Heracles, and thus to Danaus, Aegyptus, and Nilus. It’s completely standard stuff for students of Greek mythology, and it’s the assumed background to plenty of standard texts. It was never suppressed; just at random here’s a rather [stuffy article from 1902](https://www.jstor.org/stable/310344?seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents) which goes over the conflicting versions of the story of the 50 daughters of Danaus in more detail than you’ll likely care for, and covers among other things the question of whether Danaus and his daughters were Egyptians.

The problem with using it as historical evidence is that this stuff is just a hot mess. Greek myths were anything but consistent. Part of the reason that 1902 article has to go into detail is the fact that the sources are contradictory to the extreme.

__Version 2__ 

Compare the family tree above with this one:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-70930be6465aeb9ca778a513c44f3fc5)

Here — instead of __Nilos > Belos > Danaus__ you have __Io > Epaphus > Libya > Belos__ . Nilus is cut out and the whole thing starts with [Io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(mythology)) an Argive priestess, and [Inachus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inachus)was king of Argos. Which leads to the reverse of the first family tree: a version in which Africans are descended from Greeks; here [Epaphus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epaphus)is another definitely another Egyptian reference (besides marrying the somewhat-too-conveniently-named Memphis, he was often confused with [Apis ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apis_(deity)#:~:text=w)%2C%20Coptic%3A%20%CF%A9%E2%B2%81%E2%B2%A1%E2%B2%89%20%E1%B8%A5ap%C9%99,worship%2C%20being%20sacrificed%20and%20reborn.)the sacred bull of Egypt) but the picture is pretty confused

> For verily Epaphus was the child of the almighty Son of Cronos, and from him sprang the dark Libyans, and high-souled Aethiopians, and the Underground-folk and feeble Pygmies.

[Hesiod, Catalogue of Women, 40a](https://www.theoi.com/Text/HesiodCatalogues.html)

This is just _one_ example — you can find others, equally far-fetched.

The world of Greek mythology is a lot like the internet: there’s a lot of irreconcilable stuff floating around. And that’s without even considering stuff like old Zeus showing up multiple times in the same family tree, Io being turned into a cow, Danaus having 50 daughters and Aegyptus having 50 sons. In short, it’s not the sort of thing that most modern historians really want to rely on.

It’s absolutely true and well known that the most commonly quoted mythological family trees depict several of the key figures in Greek mythology with historical connections to Egypt. People argued about this stuff endlessly, and they spilled a lot of ink trying to settle it all, but nobody in antiquity found it shocking or demeaning that there were supposed biological links between famous Greek figures and Egypt or the Near East. The core of Greek mythology concerned the Egyptian-connected royals of Argos and the Phoenician-descended royalty of Thebes. When it was convenient, the Greeks themselves were happy to play it up: Alexander made use of the fact that as a descendant of Heracles he was, mythologically speaking, an Egyptian ([as a descendant of Perseus he was also, mythologically, Persian](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-face-with-flowing-hair-which-can-be-seen-on-the-cuirasses-of-Alexander-the-Great-in-the-Alexander-Mosaic-and-the-bust-of-Scipio-Africanus/answer/Steve-Theodore)).

__Version 3__ 

There is a whole different origin-of-the-Greeks story which has nothing to do with the rest of the world.

You’re probably familiar with “Hellenic” as the self-designation of Greeks. That is supposed to be “literal” — because in yet another myth they are the children of [Hellen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellen). Here’s his family tree:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-62b649f40e4095dedf0721e9fbdc8d71)

A couple of things to note here: first, those names at the bottom might look suspiciously familiar. Dorus is the ancestor of the Dorian-speaking Greeks. Achaeus and Ion fathered the Achaean and Ionian speakers, respectively. Aeolus and is the ancestor of the Aeolics and Makednos of the Macedonians.

As before, it’s not hard to find other conflicting versions. Almost all of them, however, agree that Hellen is the son of [Deucalion and Pyrrha](https://www.theoi.com/Heros/Deukalion.html) — the Greek equivalent of Noah and his wife. They were the only named survivors of the Greek equivalent of Noah’s flood:

> And Prometheus had a son Deukalion (Deucalion). He reigning in the regions about Phthia, married Pyrrha, the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora, the first woman fashioned by the gods. And when Zeus would destroy the men of the Bronze Age, Deukalion by the advice of Prometheus constructed a chest, and having stored it with provisions he embarked in it with Pyrrha. But Zeus by pouring heavy rain from heaven flooded the greater part of Greece, so that all men were destroyed, except a few who fled to the high mountains in the neighborhood. It was then that the mountains in Thessalia parted, and that all the world outside the Isthmos and Peloponnese was overwhelmed.

> But Deukalion, floating in the chest over the sea for nine days and as many nights, drifted to Parnassos (Parnassus), and there, when the rain ceased, he landed and sacrificed to Zeus Phyxios (God of Escape). And Zeus sent Hermes to him and allowed him to choose what he would, and he chose to get men. And at the bidding of Zeus he took up stones and threw them over his head, and the stones which Deukalion threw became men, and the stones which Pyrrha threw became women. Hence people were called metaphorically people (_laos_ ) from _laas_ , ‘a stone.’"

Apollodorus _Bibliotheca_ , 1.7.2

So in the version — which was just as common as the Argive/Cadmean legends — _all_ of mankind is descended from Deucalion and Pyrrha, a couple who lived in Pthia (what would one day be Achilles’ home region) and were descended directly from the two Titans, Prometheus and Epimetheus.

You’re about not going to find a lot of academics willing to argue to for the literal truth of that one.

__Version 4__ 

And there’s actually at least one more story the Greeks — or more specifically, the Athenians — told about their own origins. I’ll spare the details (which are kinda weird) but the short version is that they claimed to be descended from [Cecrops](https://www.theoi.com/Heros/Kekrops.html) and [Erectheus](https://theodora.com/encyclopedia/e/erechtheus.html): the first a half-human/half-dragon child of Mother Earth, the second a child of Athena, Aroura, and Hephaestus.*** The Athenians liked to use this myth to argue that (in contrast to their Spartan enemies, who were descendants of the famous wanderer Heracles) they were _autochthones_ , “born of their own soil.”

And yet (more confusion!) in later sources, Cecrops — mister born-from-the-Attic-earth himself — gets described as an Egyptian immigrant.

__Conclusion__ 

If you can see some clear, simple, easy to read story in all of that, you’re a lot smarter than I am. And this is the simplified, cleaned up version of four basic stories; the real count of variants would run into scores. We haven’t even gotten into story of the [Pelasgians](https://www.quora.com/The-Pelasgians-are-frequently-mentioned-in-Classical-and-Hellenistic-Greek-literature-as-a-non-Greek-people-who-lived-in-Greece-in-the-far-past-How-likely-is-it-that-these-references-are-distorted-memories-of-the/answer/Steve-Theodore).

All that doesn’t stop people from trying to use this evidence to turn Greece into an Egyptian “colony” or “offshoot”. The closest this comes to scholarly respectability is the work of the late [Martin Bernal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bernal) , whose [Black Athena](https://amzn.to/3lpkPXd) (published in the 80’s) tries really, really, _really_ hard to argue for something like the literal truth of that first family tree.

Unfortunately linguists don’t buy his linguistic arguments, archaeologists don’t buy his archaeological ones, and historians find his handling of sources amateurish. _Black Athena_  is actually quite popular with people who don’t do classical history, Greek philology, archaeology or or Egyptian linguistics. Within those specialties it is usually dismissed with an eye-roll. It doesn’t help that his standard go-to argument is talking about how bigoted and racist some classicists were in the 18th and 19th centuries: that’s a reason to read those sources with skepticism, to be sure — but it’s hardly evidence for what Bernal is selling, which is not too far from being the exact same story of the “civilizers” and the “civilized” with the casting simply reversed.

For a great, nuanced look at the way this “evidence” holds up to scrutiny, I’d recommend [this article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26308565) (from 1992, by the way — this subject has been a perennial in ancient history circles for 40+ years). I also covered it in [this answer](https://www.quora.com/What-if-any-is-the-part-of-truth-to-Martin-Bernals-Black-Athena/answer/Steve-Theodore). But the TLDR is simple: if you looked at any other aspect of ancient history using Bernal’s approaches you’d have a hard time passing your graduate exams.

Treating these stories hamhandedly leads to things like [Britons being descendants of Trojans](https://anthonyadolph.co.uk/descendants-of-the-trojan-kings/).

_This one doesn’t actually argue for the literal truth of the Brutus-of-Troy legend of British origins. But it cites a lot of folks who did. Here, for example, is_ _[the family tree of King Edward IV connecting back through Uther Pendragon to Brutus of Troy to Noah.](http://canterburyroll.canterbury.ac.nz/)_ 

_Black Athena,_ for all it’s faults, does have one important virtue. It marks the formal ending of a set of 19th-century approaches to Greek history that had been in academic decline since the 30’s but which hadn’t been thoroughly aired out. It’s great that the discussion forced a clear revisiting of the source material, it’s limitations, and the assumptions that earlier generations of scholars had brought to it. It’s a shame that the side effect has been a replacement of a 19th century model with one that really would have been more at home in the 9th century when literalist approaches to ancient material were the norm.

_A family tree from the_ [Frankish Table Of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankish_Table_of_Nations),_a text that probably originated in the 6th century. You’ll note that in this version “Romanus” is the ancestor of the Latins, “Francus” of the Franks, Britto of the Britons and so on, all descended from “Alanus”._ 



*All those “who should be allowed to play Cleopatra” questions really could be aimed with perfect legitimacy at [Alexa Davalos](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1111968/) and/or [Judi Bowker](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0101175/), who played Andromeda in the 2010 and 1981 versions of _Clash of the Titans. …_ but [not until somebody is held to account for the presence of Kraken — a monster out of Scandinavian lore — in a Greek mythology movie.](https://www.quora.com/If-the-Kraken-is-a-Norse-myth-how-did-it-become-part-of-Greek-mythology/answer/Steve-Theodore)) Though to be fair to Hollywood, most Greek depictions of the Ethiopian princess were also light-skinned (Ovid is the only ancient author who actually mentioned a dark complexion).

** “Danaans” is actually something of a puzzler: since the Greeks typically didn’t trace descent in the female line. You’d expect “Aegyptids,” since the same line of descent goes equally well through Lynceus and Aegyptus. It may all really come down to Homer’s need for a synonyms with the right stress patterns.

*** This is where the weirdness I alluded to comes in. Let’s just say there’s lettuce, wool, and three gods involved.
