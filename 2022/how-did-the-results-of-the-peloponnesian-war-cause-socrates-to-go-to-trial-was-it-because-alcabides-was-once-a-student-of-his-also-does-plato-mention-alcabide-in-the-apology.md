# How did the results of the Peloponnesian War cause Socrates to go to trial? Was it because Alcabides was once a student of his? Also, does Plato mention Alcabide in the Apology?

In addition to all sorts of other social status issues, Socrates in 399 BC was stuck in roughly the same position as, say, Benedict Arnold’s best friend in 1781. Except Socrates had it worse — Alcibiades was notorious but he was not even the most hated of Socrates’ former associates.

__Alcibiades__ 

Alcibiades had been one of the most popular and talented Athenian commanders in the middle years of the Peloponnesian war. However he was always regarded as something of an adventurer by democrats and conservatives alike who were wary of his charisma and his racy lifestyle.

_Socrates hauling a young Alcibiades out of a brothel._ _[Etienne-Barthélemy Garnier, sometime around 1793.](https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/14047)_ 

In 415 BC Alcibiades was recalled from command of the Athenian forces in Sicily to stand trial for sacrilege; instead, he escaped and fled to Sparta, where for a couple of years he provided valuable advice to the Spartans including designing the occupation of [Decelea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decelea), which ruined the Athenian countryside and threatened the irreplaceable silver mines at Laurion. This move destroyed the livelihoods of most rural Athenians.

Alcibiades, who had a genius for pissing people off, also ended up having an affair with one of the queens of Sparta. He had to flee for his life and ended up in Persian Asia Minor, and promptly started intriguing against his former Spartan pals. This did enough to restore his reputation that he was actually able to wangle an invitation to negotiate on Athens’ behalf with the Persians and, if a deal could be struck, to return home to Athens. However he was not able to land the deal.

Some of the Athenians who had been working on Alcibiades’ behalf, however, had ideas of their own: in 411 several of them were among the leaders of the coup which temporarily toppled the democracy and created the [repressive oligarchy known as the 400.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_coup_of_411_BC) Amazingly, despite this Alcibiades managed to convince the Athenian navy — the stronghold of democracy — to allow him to help them overthrow the oligarchs (including the oligarchs who, a few months earlier, had been working to bring him back from exile). He won a few naval battles and rehabilitated his reputation to some degree; he was finally allowed back to the city’s good graces in 407 by the restored democracy.

But the next year, he blew it all by losing a fleet to the Spartans at [Notium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Notium).

With the halo of victory pulled from his head, Alcibiades knew better than to go back to Athens where his many enemies were salivating at the chance to hold him accountable for his adventures. He exiled himself, settling down in Persian-controlled Phrygia. In 403 — four years before the trial of Socrates — he was assassinated. Characteristically, it’s not clear if this was arranged by political enemies or by the outraged family of a girl he had seduced.

__Critias__ 

Because Alcibiades was such a celebrity in his own lifetime and beyond, he tends to get all the press. But Socrates was also closely associated with an even more sinister figure: [Critias](https://www.worldhistory.org/Critias/), the most violent and extreme face of the Quislling oligarchy imposed by the Spartans at the end of the war. he was the most tyrannical of the so-called “[Thirty Tyrants](https://www.worldhistory.org/The_Thirty_Tyrants/)”.

Critias had been a student of Socrates alongside Alcibiades. Critias had been one of those who intrigued for Alcibiades’s recall. He even briefly followed his friend into exile around 406.

However, Critias returned at the end of the war and quickly became the most visible and notorious face of the regime of the Thirty. His principles, whatever they may have been in public, had ceased to include loyalty to friends. He engineered the execution of [Theramenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theramenes), the most moderate of the Thirty, who had helped him in his earlier efforts to bring Alcibiades home. He also tried to have the exiled Alcibiades killed — though either the Spartans or the outraged locals beat him to the punch. His relationship with his former tutor soured too, though in a less final fashion: Socrates criticized him for abusing his power in pursuit of a handsome youth, and Critias in turn passed a law outlawing the teaching of rhetoric which was seen as aimed at Socrates.

Had the Thirty stayed in power it’s not clear that Socrates would have survived — but the violent and oppressive regime lasted less than a year. Critias was killed in the uprising which restored the democracy, and mourned by almost no one.

__Socrates__ 

All of this adds up to one thing for Socrates: __association with both Critias and Alcibiades was bad news.__ Both had made enemies all over the political spectrum at Athens. Both had collaborated with the Spartans. Both were widely seen as hostile to traditional Athenian values. Both were clearly willing to put their own ambitions ahead of the lives of their fellow citizens. As Xenophon put it:

> he two men who wrought the greatest evils to the state at any time—to wit, Critias and Alcibiades—were both companions of Socrates—Critias the oligarch, and Alcibiades the democrat. Where would you find a more arrant thief, savage, and murderer than the one? where such a portent of insolence, incontinence, and high-handedness as the other?

[Memorabilia 1.2.31](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1177/1177-h/1177-h.htm)

Against that background it did not matter very much that Socrates had nothing to do with either man’s political adventures, or even that Socrates had publicly defied Critias during their reign. He was tainted by association with two of the most hated men in Athens — both of whom, by the time of his trial, were dead and beyond the reach of other vengeance.

It didn’t help either that both Critias and Alcibiades were widely suspected of blasphemy and atheism. It was easy for people who hadn’t been in Socrates’s symposia to conclude that his two notorious pupils had picked up their radical ideas from him. Plato and Xenophon (both friends of Socrates) say otherwise — but both were connected to the aristocratic circles which had initially supported the Thirty Tyrants, so their testimony was discounted by many.

So, when the Athenian jury charged Socrates with “corrupting the youth” it was code for two very particular youths whose stories had turned out terribly. It’s not hard to see the trial and conviction of Socrates as a posthumous attack on his two notorious students, with Socrates himself merely a convenient opportunity for score-settling in the aftermath of a civil war. It’s probably no accident that Plato’s _Apology_  doesn’t mention either of Socrates’ two black sheep by name.
