Several of them went on to long lives. Probably the most successful of the ‘other’ Alexandrias is modern [Kandahar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar) (Alexandria Arachosia), which has always been a key center in the region. [İskenderun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0skenderun) (or “Alexandretta”) in Turkey has had a couple of cycles of prosperity down the centuries, but remains an important regional capital. [Ai-Khanoum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai-Khanoum) (Alexandria on the Oxus) was the capital of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom and a wealthy entrepot until it was destroyed by the Yuezhi invasions in the second century.
