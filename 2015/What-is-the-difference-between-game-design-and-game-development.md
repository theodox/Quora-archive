Anybody who works on games -- or at least, who works on the creation and content of games (some developers don't think marketing, admin and HR count) -- is a game __developer__ . A __designer__ is a developer whose job involves establishing the way the game interacts with players: this covers everything from writing storylines and dialog to deciding how much damage a given attack will inflict to laying out puzzles or scenarios. Developer connotes that you work on games; designer is a discipline within the industry; programmers, artists and audio specialists are all developers too.
