# Did the ancient historians of Europe like Livy, Pliny, etc. make any reference to the language spoken in India since Greeks and Romans were in touch with it through employment, trade, etc.?

They don’t make any effort to record the languages they encountered systematically, although we can see some of the Indian linguistic context from the proper names that the Greek authors reproduced. The Greeks weren’t great at phonetic representation of other people’s languages, but we have examples of the way Greeks wrote words from several other tongues which gives us some control on what the would or would not be likely to catch.

A simple example is the career of the king we know in English as [Chandragupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_Maurya) (Sanskrit: चन्द्रगुप्त). His name is transcribed by his Greek contemporaries (around 300 BCE) as Σανδράκοττος, “Sandrakottos” or Σανδρόκυπτος, “Sandrokuptos.” ¹ As you can see the Greeks represented the च ( [t͡ʃ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate) in IPA, roughly the “ch” in “cheese”) with their Σ, which is essentially an English “s”. It’s hard to know if the different vowel sounds (Sandr__a__ k__o__ ttos, Sandr__o__ k__u__ ptos) represent different efforts to capture the real sounds or if they are just scribal mistakes related to unfamiliar sounds. From the same period and work we we have a reference to the the Maura capital, written in Greek as Παλιβόθρα, “Palibothra.” [The original will have पाटलिपुत्र “Pāṭaliputra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pataliputra),” modern Patna. Here it sounds like the Greeks lost the initial syllable (which we know from Jain and Buddhist texts) — this might be a fault of a Greek scribe or simply poor listening on the part of the first author, the Greek diplomat [Megasthenes](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0104:entry=megasthenes-bio-1).

Some other words which were captured in Greek around the same era times are familiar. Megasthenes and later writers spoke admiringly of the βραχμᾶνες “Brachmanes,” who are clearly what Sanskrit knew as ब्राह्मणाः and modern English calls “Brahmins.” They contrasted these with the _Σαρμάνες,_ “Sarmanes,” who were ascetics — the Sanskrit श्रमण, _Śramaṇa.²_  Here you can see that the Greek writers had a bit of trouble with the initial two consonants, turning _sra-_ into _sar-_ because they were not fond of initial consonant clusters. On the other hand [Ashoka’s rock edicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_Greek_Edicts_of_Ashoka) used βραμεναι and σραμεναι, “bramenai” and “sramenai”: perhaps the carvers, living in India, were less put off by the consonant clusters.

About two centuries after Alexander’s adventures first introduced the Greeks to northern India, the [opening of the Indian Ocean trade routes](https://www.quora.com/Did-any-Roman-during-the-Roman-Republic-or-Empire-set-foot-in-India/answer/Steve-Theodore) familiarized the Greeks and then the Romans with the southern reaches of the subcontinent, Sri Lanka, Indochina, and Java. Although these contacts left a noticeable amount of material evidence, we are not always sure how to interpret the place names. The most famous Greek place name in South India is [Muziris](http://know-your-heritage.blogspot.com/2017/02/muziris-muciri-sangam-era-port-in.html), a popular trading port (probably, modern [Pattanam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattanam), Kerala) which hosted a sizeable Greco-Roman population. The name is probably from Tamil முசிறி “Muciri.” A few South Indian commodities also made their way into Greek language — the most famous being ginger, which in Greek is ζιγγίβερις “zingiberis” and which probably comes via Old Tamil இஞ்சிவேர்., “ingiver”.³ On the other hand the Greek word for “coconut” is ἀργέλλια, “argellia”, which comes from Sanskrit नारिकेल, “nārikela.”⁴

You can get a sense of level of knowledge from the famous passage Pliny’s _Natural History,_  which illustrates nicely how hard it was to communicate accurately about far-off lands and foreign languages in a pre-printing world. Some modern guesses at the local place names are included in parentheses:

> To those who are bound for India, Ocelis is the best place for embarcation. If the wind, called Hippalus, happens to be blowing, it is possible to arrive in forty days at the nearest mart of India, Muziris by name. This, however, is not a very desirable place for disembarkation, on account of the pirates which frequent its vicinity, where they occupy a place called Nitrias __(?)__ ; nor, in fact, is it very rich in articles of merchandize. Besides, the road-stead for shipping is a considerable distance from the shore, and the cargoes have to be conveyed in boats, either for loading or discharging. At the moment that I am writing these pages, the name of the king of this place is Caelobothras __(__ __[Keralaputras](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Cera-dynasty)__ __)__ . Another port, and a much more convenient one, is that which lies in the territory of the people called Neacyndi __(?),__ Barace (__Puhar?__ )____ by name. Here king Pandion __(__ __[Pandya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandya_dynasty)__ __)__  used to reign, dwelling at a considerable distance from the mart in the interior, at a city known as Modiera (__[Madurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madurai)__ ). The district from which pepper is carried down to Barace in boats hollowed out of a single tree, is known as Cottonara(__[Kuttunad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuttanad)__ ). None of these names of nations, ports, and cities are to be found in any of the former writers, from which circumstance it would appear that the localities have since changed their names.

[Nat. Hist. 6.26.7](https://topostext.org/people_index.php?pid=5137)

So: a few words did indeed find their way from India to the Greco-Roman Mediterranean. Most of these are place names or the names of exotic commodities, though a few social terms are also visible. Undoubtedly there were some people in the Greco-Roman world who were more familiar with Indian languages than this suggests. There’s some [archeological evidence of Indian traders living and working in Roman Egypt](https://books.openedition.org/cdf/5232), for example.

Perhaps the most interesting find of all is [Papryus Oxyrhyncus 413](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_Oxyrhynchus_413), a [Greek burlesque comedy featuring a couple of characters identified in the text as Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charition_mime). The Indian characters speak an Indian-inflected sort of gibberish — it’s not really readable but [some modern scholars have interpreted it as a garbled rendering of Kannada or Tulu](https://maddy06.blogspot.com/2010/03/charition-mime-and-udyavara.html). In this regards it’s parallel to the pseudo-Punic comedy bits in Plautus’ _[Poenulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poenulus)_ _._ In both cases the plays expect an audience that’s not well-versed in a foreign tongue but which must have had enough exposure to get the sounds and flavor of the language being performed.

> CLOWN: What are they saying?
CHARITION'S BROTHER: Give them something to drink! Hurry!
CLOWN: Don't want to talk, huh? Good day! Hello!
KING: _Zeitsoukormosede._ CLOWN: Ow! Not if you know what's good for you!
CHARITION'S BROTHER: It's watery. Throw in some wine.
BARBARIAN A: _Skalmakatabapteiragoumi_ .
BARBARIAN B: _Tougoummi. Nekelekethro._ BARBARIAN A: _Eitoubelletra choupteragoumi._ CLOWN: Oh! Don't make me sick! Stop! Oh! What are you doing?

So — we don’t have anything like a Greek effort to describe Sanskrit grammar or a nice annotated list of Tamil words. We do have a few names and place-names, and a little bit of tantalizing evidence that suggests there were more than just a handful of people in the Greco-Roman world who had at least heard an Indian language spoken.



¹ Some other sources also give “Androkottos” but this is almost certainly a scribal error.
² Sometimes you’ll find this written as Γαρμᾶνες, “Garmanes”: this is probably an accident of medieval copyists who had texts with a lazy version of the “[lunate Sigma](https://koineworkbook.wordpress.com/2015/04/13/the-lunate-sigma-2/)” — a later form of Σ____ which looked like С and became the “C” in “CCCР”. They saw an unfamiliar word they mistook a hasty С for Γ. Later Greek writers sometimes use Σαμαναῖοι, which is probably an example of the word being familiar enough that it has slid into a more Greek-sounding form. 
³ There are other potential derivations, such as Sanskrit शृङ्गवेर “Śṛṅgavera “. Thanks to [Rajkumar Chelladurai](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rajkumar-Chelladurai-1) for correcting my transliteration, btw. 
⁴[ In modern Greek ναργιλές is a hookah](https://www.wordsense.eu/%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%AD%CF%82/) — in olden days, the base was as a coconut, which entered Persian as a _nargil_ , thence to Turkish and finally to modern Greek.
