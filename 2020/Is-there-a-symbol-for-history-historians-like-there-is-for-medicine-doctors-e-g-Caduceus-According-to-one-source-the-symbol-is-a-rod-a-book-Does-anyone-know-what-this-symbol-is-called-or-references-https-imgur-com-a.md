# Is there a symbol for history/historians like there is for medicine/doctors (e.g. Caduceus)? According to one source, the symbol is a rod + a book. Does anyone know what this symbol is called or references? https://imgur.com/a/PZK4iyv

I couldn’t find “history” in the images on the linked page; I’m a bit offended that kinesiology gets one but history does not, apart from a “liberal arts” icon (which is, curiously, dominated by the Greek letter ψ_,_ usually used for psychology).

The traditional image is [Clio](https://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/MousaKleio.html), the muse of history — typically depicted as a woman gesturing towards a book (usually, a scroll) in her left hand:

Occasionally she’s depicted with a trumpet, which represents her role in proclaiming the great deeds recorded in history:

Once in a while you’ll see her with what looks like a bucket; that’s a _capsa_ , a scroll-carrier:

The outfits vary a lot (in Renaissance and Baroque art she’s often in “contemporary” dress” but the most common is a full-length [peplos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peplos) or [stola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stola#:~:text=The%20stola%20was%20the%20traditional,expected%20to%20wear%20the%20stola.) — a heavily draped ankle-length garment. Unlike most Greco-Roman goddesses Clio rarely appears topless.

More often than not she’ll be wearing a [laurel wreath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_wreath), though symbolically that’s common to many kinds of literary imagery.

So - the “rod and book’ might be a “horn and book” on closer examination. However there’s not a widely recognized iconic form equivalent to the caduceus.
