There are quite a few, actually.

The famous one is Verdi’s [Aida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aida), which centers on a war between Egypt and Ethiopia. Aida was actually commissioned by Ismail Pasha, the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, in 1871 — [the world premiere was in Cairo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khedivial_Opera_House), in Africa’s first-ever opera house. The main characters are a captive Ethiopian princess, Aida and her Egyptian lover, the warrior Radames.

Less well known are [Sophonisba](https://www.classical-scene.com/2011/03/28/sophonisba/), by Maria Teresa Agnesi, and [Sofonisba](http://www.opera-rara.com/sofonisba.html) by Fernando Paer — both of which tell the same story during the war between Roman and Carthage and are set in modern Algeria and Tunisia. Also in set in Carthage are several different musical settings based on the libretto [Didone Abbandonata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didone_abbandonat), (“The Abandonment of Dido”, a story from the Aeneid) .

Handel actually has three African operas: [Giulio Cesare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Cesare) is set in Egypt during Julius Caesar’s affair with Cleopatra, [Tolomeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolomeo) concerns the messy career of the King Ptolemy IX, and [Berenice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenice_(opera)) deals with Ptolemy’s daughter. All of these were from Italian librettos which also used by less famous composers.

There are probably a few more — baroque composers loved to borrow stories from classical antiquity, so anywhere from Morocco to the Red Sea (on the north side of the Sahara, at least) might have an obscure opera attached.
