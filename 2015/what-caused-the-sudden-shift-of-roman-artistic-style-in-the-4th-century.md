There are several different things going on at once. However the shift is not as sudden as it may seem. The sudden jump between chapters in an art history textbook is really foregrounding a development that took over a century.

__Economic Context__ 

The [third century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century) was a disaster: civil wars, invasions, and economic collapse. [Diocletian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian) managed to pull things back from the brink, but a heavy cost. Maintaining the peace — such as it was — put a huge strain on the diminished economy. In an effort to keep the government funded Diocletian and his successors tried to [regulate the economy tightly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_on_Maximum_Prices), which didn't work very well. The long-distance trade and commercial focus of the early Empire broke down as wealthy people reverted to a cash-free, estate based economy that was harder to tax. This is often seen as the real beginning of the feudal system. Moreover the constant threat of civil wars encouraged those who could to withdraw to a safer, isolated, rural life.

Although there were bright spots with strong local economies in the fourth century, the overall picture was one of economic contraction and de-urbanisation. As a side effect, the delicate network of skills and traditions that supported traditional forms came under intense pressure.

__Psychological context.__ 

The crisis of the third century also shook Roman self confidence. Compare this serene Augustus:

with this very pensive Aurelian (AD 215):

and this surly Galerius (300)

You can see the artists progressively de-emphasizing the naturalistic - but heavily airbrushed detail - in favor of a less realist, more exaggerated conveyance of seriousness. _Gravitas_  was always a Roman virtue; a lot of Roman Republican statuary emphasized a dour mien as a way of conveying the authority of an important Senator or general. But in the palmy days of the early empire, when money was flowing and the hybrid of Roman power and Greek culture seemed like a perfect marriage, the Hellenistic tendency towards lushness and idealization predominated over those more gravelly old _patresfamiliarum._ 

However that was a cultural moment that passed in the chaos of the third century. Worry was back, in a big way. The desire to appear up to the monumental tasks of ruling tended to be an important aspect of image making in the late third and early fourth century. That's why Constantine went so big:

Combined with the need to project seriousness, changes in Roman society encouraged the development of a new visual language.

__A new audience__ 

The old art was curated by, and aimed at, an educated, aristocratic audience. A century of warfare and civil strife had decimated those old aristocracies: while there were still many wealthy and educated remnants, they were no longer the undisputed masters of the social and political hierarchy. The reigning power was the army: it provided the emperors and enforced the laws (such as they were).

That army was very heavily drawn from frontier provinces, particularly in the Balkans and along the Rhine. It was not so tightly tethered to the Mediterranean traditions of Athens and Alexandria. Even Diocletian who was very self conscious of his role as savior of Rome, still commissioned propaganda pieces like these:

The Tetrarchs can't touch the Augustus of Prima Porta for subtlety. However, it does a great job of selling the message "All four emperors _together_ " in a way that no illiterate Dacian could miss; delicate allusions to Homer need not apply.

The new styles were not completely exclusive of the old. The same emperor also commissioned this:

a much more nostalgic image, but less useful for communicating with the masses.

__Philosophical context__ 

Lastly,there was an intense interest in the spiritual dimension of life that had no obvious touchstone in the old vocabulary. This is true both inside and outside of the Christian context — other late Antique ideologies such as Gnosticism, Mithraism and Neo-Platonism all tended to emphasize individual spiritual experience and a much more abstract view of the cosmos in ways that had no good analogue in classical art. The depiction of quotidian reality didn’t meet the needs of the moment as well as it had in a more serene time.

It’s important to remember that this didn’t mean there were no depictions of day-to-day life or that everything had to suddenly become a ponderous allegory or a stunning iconostasis. Even Justinian — hardly a friend of the classical tradition in many ways — decorated his own palace with things like this, more than two centuries after his city was built by that abstracted giant, Constantine.

__TLDR__ 

To sum up: Rome had a really crummy century, and the post-crisis Empire had to rebuild it's self image. The issues were much starker, and the audience quite different, than they had been in the easier times of Augustus or Hadrian.

You can somewhat draw the analogy to the difference in art styles between 1890 and 1920: the intervening disasters made the easy technical fluency and mastery of surfaces seem somewhat hollow (and to extend the analogy, you can see that some forces (like Impressionism and Cubism) were at work _before_  the crisis really came to a head; they just found their moment because the old order seemed so insupportable.

All that said the old styles linger on in places all the way up into the 6th and 7th centuries, with periodic classical revivals and quotations. However by that time the market for such products was very small -- mostly a dwindling class of nostalgic aristocrats.
