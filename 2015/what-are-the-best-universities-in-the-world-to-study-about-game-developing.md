I'm mildly skeptical about that top 50 list. 

In general, traditional academic institutions don't have a huge impact on the industry side. Some traditional CS powerhouses, particularly those with a graphics or animation pedigree (Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Tech, USC come to mind) have good reputations among programmers; a handful of art schools have a big draw for animation in particular (CalArts, SCAD, ). But in general "big academia" doesn't the same kind of clout in the games business that it does in older, more mature businesses. 

There are a lot of game development programs, but relatively few have really good connections in the industry -- if you are talking to any program ask a lot of questions about how many people they have placed, with what companies. Many of these programs are very expensive and only a handful get much attention from professionals. [Digipen](http://www.digipen.edu), for example, has a pretty good reputation, largely because it's a tough program with a fairly high washout rate. Many other schools are happy to keep taking money and passing out degrees which don't matter very much in the jobs market. The most well known game vocational schools, like [Full Sail](http://www.fullsail.edu/) and [The Art Institutes](http://new.artinstitutes.edu/) have multiple programs with different degrees of quality and industry connections.

Whether or not you go for a traditional four year school or a vocational school, most of what you learn will be driven by your own work and ambition. One thing is absolutely certain: no degree in the field is a guarantee of future employment! So be a smart consumer, ask a lot of questions, and also be sure you are really going to spend a career in games before going deeply into debt! A traditional college degree with a couple of good indie projects is a good advertisement for your skills and a bit less risky than an expensive, narrowly targeted games program. A general purpose CS or art degree is a bit more useful if it turns out that games aren't to your liking.
