Actually Wilhelm did deliberately invoke the Huns in his send-off speech to the German expeditionary forces, a bombastic piece of nonsense that generated great scorn among most of the rest of Europe.

 It wasn't intended as an echo of historical successes against China: He was trying to encourage the German troops to set an example of intimidating power that would "keep the Chinese on their place." He ended up looking pretty silly, since it's pretty hard to justify the superior claims of your own civilization by invoking the legacy of people you yourself claim are barbarians... But Wilhelm had a genius for histrionics of this sort. Only Wilhelm could transition unselfconsciously from

Just as a thousand years ago the Huns under their King Attila made a name for themselves, one that even today makes them seem mighty in history and legend, may the name German be affirmed by you in such a way in China that no Chinese will ever again dare to look cross-eyed at a German.”

This was also the origin of the use of "Huns" as a pejorative term for Germans in WWI. More sadly, it was the another manifestation of the idea of [Schrecklichkeit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrecklichkeit): the deliberate use of terror and indiscriminate reprisal as a tactic for intimidating non-combatants.
