Yes — and, interestingly, Rome didn’t _conquer_  the island. It _inherited_ it.

And then conquered it anyway, 25 years later.

The last independent ruler of Crete was [Ptolemy Apion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_Apion), a scion of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. He was a minor Ptolemy: his mother was a concubine, his father the erratic [Ptolemy Physcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_VIII_Physcon).

The family owed the Romans a favor. Physcon had been on the losing end of one the endemic civil wars in Egypt. In 163 BC, he was driven out of Egypt but the Romans intervened and brokered a deal which left him the province of in charge of the Ptolemaic province of Cyrenaica, including Crete. Physcon eventually returned to Egypt (again, with Roman backing) but [in his will he left the province of Cyrenaica to the Roman Republic](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/the-will-of-ptolemy-viii-physcon/).

The will was conditional on Ptolemy having no heirs — but he ended up with a sort of half-heir in the person of Apion, who was Ptolemy’s son with a concubine and not the product of a properly Ptolemaic brother-sister marriage. As a half-Ptolemy Apion was not in line for the Egyptian throne, but he did inherit Cyrenaica from his father, taking over in 116 BC.

Evidently (our sources aren’t very detailed) Apion set up a will like his father’s, leaving Cyrenaica and Crete to the Romans should he die without an heir — which he did in 96, leaving his province to Rome.

The Romans at this period seem to have encouraged deals like this with their client kings — other rulers who left their kingdoms to Rome included [Attalus III of Pergamon](https://www.theherodotusreport.co.uk/post/the-will-of-attalus), [Ptolemy Alexander I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_X_Alexander_I), and [Nicomedes IV of Bithynia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomedes_IV_of_Bithynia) (famous for his rumored affair with Julius Caesar).

It was actually a reasonable deal for both parties. In the event of a regular succession, it was nothing more than a good will gesture, a cheap way for a client king to signal his pro-Roman stance. On the other hand if a king died heirless, the will gave the Romans an obvious legal stake in what happened next. Given the propensity for Hellenistic kingdoms to dissolve into fratricidal civil wars this was a policy investment for the Romans and often a life insurance policy for their clients: bumping off uncle Attalus meant the legions were going to show up on your doorstep.

In this case, the Roman inheritors didn’t exactly snap into action when Apion died in 96 BC. Cyrenaica and Crete remained basically self-governing for another 25 years.

In fact, Roman overlordship was so negligent that the Cretans were playing footsie with the Rome’s arch-enemy [Mithradates of Pontus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_VI_Eupator)and the infamous [Cilician Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilician_pirates) while nominally under Roman control. So, in 71 BC, Marc Antony’s father botched an effort to suppress piracy in Crete and earned the mocking nickname of “Creticus” — which sounded like “conqueror of Crete” but also meant “chalk stick”. Shortly thereafter the Cretans rejected a Roman demand to turn over the pirate collaborators, which led to an all-out war lasting three years (69–66). Crete (and Cyrenaica) were formally annexed as Roman territory during the war, in 67 BC.

Crete remained Roman until it was conquered by Muslims from Spain in 824.
