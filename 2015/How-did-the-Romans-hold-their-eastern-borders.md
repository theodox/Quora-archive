The Romans always preferred clients and buffer states when they could find reliable ones -- but that was not always possible. Many of the wars they fought in the east weren't direct confrontations with their eastern rivals but efforts to force unruly clients into line or to make sure a pro-Roman party stayed in power.

We tend to look at the map and focus on Syria, where the Persians were closest to the Mediterranean; it's the site of most of the famous Roman-Persian clashes from Carrhae down to the Persian conquest of Egypt in the 600's. However If you look at the typical patterns of the conflict you can see the Syria was really the flank, not the center of the border (I rotated this map to make it more obvious)

Even though Arabia and the Syrian Desert occupy a huge swath of the map they were militarily useless to both sides (among other things, camels were not really domesticated until the first century or so -- the technology of crossing the desert was much less advanced than what, say, a bedouin army fighting the Ottomans in 1917 would have). Even if you could march an army through Syria you'd have to supply it through a bottleneck that could be cut off. So the primary focus of the conflicts was through either through the central Anatolian plateau at the crossings of the Euphrates in northern Syria.

That's why the flashpoint of Roman-Persian relations was always the kingdom of [Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_relations_with_the_Armenians), which which was a the site of all the big east-west clashes. The Romans and Persians usually found diplomatic ways to maintain Armenia as a more-or-less neutral state but whenever there was a change of rulers in Armenia there was a risk of conflict. Armenia was always the central theater of the Roman/Parthian/Persian 'Great Game' -- intrigue, assassinations, and dubious dealings were the order of the day. Most of the big crises between Roma and Parthia/Persia followed some kind of turmoil in the Armenian royal house: a disputed succession, a civil war, or an overly ambitious king trying to be more than a buffer between east and west.

 At various times there were also client kingdoms in [Commagene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Commagene), [Osrhoene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osroeneand), and [Palmyra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra) which covered most of modern Syria and eastern Turkey - these played the same role in buffering the Romans and Parthians or Persians from each other but -- since there were more defensible natural frontiers on this side of the map they didn't last as long as Armenia. Roman client kingdoms in Arabia and Judea, Colchis and the Crimea completed the protective belt. Unlike Armenia, though, these client states were eventually absorbed by the Romans in one form or another between the first and third centuries, due to worries about their reliability or intrigue among the royal houses. Palmyra was the longest lasting and most successful of these -- it remained a fairly powerful vassal state down to the end of the 3rc century when the renegade warrior-queen [Zenobia](http://Zenobia) took advantage of a Roman civil war to march her armies as far as Egypt -- an adventure which ended Palmyra's independence (see [Why did the Romans attack Palmyra?](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Romans-attack-Palmyra))

As for military defenses: In Europe the system of _limes_ was not really a fortified border 'wall' -- it was mostly designed as a way to slow down raiding armies from across the Rhine or Danube long enough for a Roman field army to find and defeat them (although as time wore on and the empire became poorer, particularly after the 4th century, the defenses did become more static). The same was true in the east, except that arid terrain and big rivers formed the primary barriers. The key bridgeheads to be watched were at [Zeugma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeugma,_Commagene) and [Samosata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samosata), backed by [Antioch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioch). In central Anatolia the center of gravity could be [Caesarea](http://Caesarea) or [Amasea](http://Amasea). Unlike the Danube and Rhine frontiers it was possible to transport armies to either northern or southern Anatolia by sea, so the Romans seem not to have invested as much effort in creating a central base like Sirmium or Augusta Treverorum. Moreover the mountainous terrain of Cappadocia made an excellent natural defense: legionary postings in Syria were usually larger to reflect the greater difficulty of defending the more open terrain.
