All answers about “American Education” have to be hopelessly partial — there are thousands of local school boards (and private schools) which decide what gets taught in the US. Their priorities, desires, and competence vary quite widely for a lot of reasons, so no single answer is going to cover them all. It’s not hard to find bits and pieces of education about ancient Rome in modern American schooling, though outside of a few very unusual places they no longer have pride of place.

The teaching of the ___Latin language___  in schools has been in retreat for a long time, going back all the way to the 19th century. Learning Latin was simply a necessary part of higher education until around the 1840’s — before that, anybody who wanted to make a serious mark in the scholarly or scientific world probably published in Latin in order to reach an international audience. But 19th century nationalism and the rise of public education (focused on practical, everyday goals rather than high culture) converted Latin from a practical necessity into a prestige marker — the slightly useless attainment of a “gentleman.”

American schools were part of that trend, even in the 19th century — Latin was a prestigious but not a practical necessity, so schools that taught it were staking out a claim as purveyors of culture rather than economic or scientific uplift. Other factors intervened as well — anti-Catholic prejudice in a few places; competition from other languages in immigrant communities; and, most recently, hostility to Eurocentric ideas about culture and canon. Nonetheless, the real driver of Latin’s retreat has always been economics: a class in auto shop or computer programming is more likely to land a student a job than even the best translation of Cicero.

From my limited sample I’d say that Roman ___history___ remains a part of the curriculum, although I almost wish it did not. It’s now just another brief stop on the harried multicultural bus tour that is the modern American approach to teaching history.

Multicultural programming in history is a noble idea. Unfortunately, as a practical matter, expecting kids to cover the entire history of mankind means they learn next to nothing of value. Typically every culture, Roman included, is taught through extremely high-level themes and vignettes, without much context or development — kids are expected to absorb and repeat a laundry list of factoids but they get remarkably little of the color which makes it interesting or the narrative which makes it memorable.

Where I live, Greece, Rome, Mesopotamia, and Egypt together get, I believe, a bit more than a semester in middle school. This isn’t radically worse than what I got forty years ago, although as more and more agenda items are added to the curriculum the actual material gets scraped even thinner. In our system there might be a chance revisit if you take an elective world history class in high school, though .

I personally prefer frank ignorance to this kind of thin gruel, whether the subject is Caesar or Montezuma. I’d rather that kids who know nothing were not conned into thinking they knew something. I understand that there’s something to be said for exposure— perhaps the kids will glimpse something out the window of their speeding tour bus that makes them curious and starts them down a more rewarding road — but I don’t see it happening very often in my limited samples.

At least here they do read the _Odyssey_ and sometimes a tragedy (Iphigenia, I think). Only a really terrible teacher could screw those up — so there’s still something to look on with pleasure.
