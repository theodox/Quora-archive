This one’s easy: _overconfidence._ 

The conditions at Salamis were favorable to the Greeks, but on a purely tactical level the ‘trap’ was not particularly subtle. Xerxes, after all, was watching the entire bay from his golden throne on Mt. Aigaleo. The movements and position of the entire Greek fleet were visible:

The element of surprise was _moral,_ rather than tactical.

The Persians knew that the Greeks were falling apart. They had inside information that told them the Greek commanders were at each others’ throats, that half the Greek fleet wanted to run and that the Athenian contingent had threatened to pack up and sail off to Italy if the rest of the Greeks withdrew to the Peloponnese.

The Persians already had a pretty low estimate of Greek fidelity to the cause. The Thebans, who had furnished the second-largest contingent at Thermopylae were now fighting for the Great King; the royal entourage included both an exiled king of Sparta and the family that had ruled Athens less than 30 years earlier. So when they heard the news coming from Salamis, they had no reason to be skeptical.

The Persians lacked only two pieces of information:

The first was simple: they didn’t know the local waters well, so they didn’t know that the morning winds and currents would roil the the waters between Salamis and the Piraeus, disrupting a tight formation and making it hard for their larger, heavier ships to maneuver.

The second was that they were being played.

Their intelligence was absolutely correct; it was a a word-for-word account of what had actually taken place in the Greek commanders’ tents before the battle. But that information had been fed to them for a very specific purpose: Themistocles, the Athenian commander, wanted to fight, and wanted to fight in the favorable waters of the straits. By leaking the information about Greek dissension to the Persians, he convinced the king to split the Persian fleet. The Egyptian squadron (200 ships or more) was detached to seal off the western exit from the bay of Eleusis and — unwittingly — to convince the waverers in the Greek fleet that fighting was the only choice. It was the news that the avenue of retreat was blocked, not any of the stirring oratory recorded by Herodotus, which determined that the battle would be fought.

The Corinthian contingent — one of the largest in the Greek fleet — seems to have made a move to the west early in the morning of the battle. The ancient accounts disagree about what this meant: they may have been tasked with watching for an enveloping attack by the Egyptian flotilla, or they may have been trying to flee: their admiral had been the most vocal advocate of retreat in the Greek camp.

In any case the Corinthian move will have looked exactly like what the Persians were already expecting: a Greek fleet with shaky morale, trapped in a position with no exits.

With vastly superior numbers and an enemy that seemed to be half-beaten already, the Persians had no reason not to feel confident. [They certainly could have “won” the battle simply by refusing to fight](https://www.quora.com/Which-one-event-wouldve-changed-the-outcome-of-the-Battle-of-Salamis): A blockade of the straits would take the Greek fleet out of the war as effectively as a battle: The Greek line at the Isthmus of Corinth could easily be turned, and the dissension in the Greek fleet could only grow worse. However, Persian plan was a war of _domination_ , not annihilation: Xerxes’ huge, unwieldy army was designed as much to intimidate as to destroy. Xerxes was banking on the fifth century BC equivalent of “shock and awe,” and swatting the Greek fleet would make profound political statement, even if it was strategically unnecessary. Xerxes was going to fight. So, the best Themistocles could do was to maneuver him into fighting in situation where his advantage in numbers was at least partially nullified by wind and water and while there was still a fleet to fight with.

It’s better to look at Salamis not as a brilliant tactical exploit, but rather as a brilliant piece of applied psychology in a desperate moment. Themistocles deceived his allies as thoroughly as he did his enemies. Salamis is the quintessential Greek victory: it’s not the ferocity of Achilles, but the wiles of Odysseus, that save the day.
