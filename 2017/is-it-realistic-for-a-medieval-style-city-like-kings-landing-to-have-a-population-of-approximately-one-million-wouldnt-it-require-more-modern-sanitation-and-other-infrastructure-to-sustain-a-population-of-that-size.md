# Is it realistic for a medieval-style city like King’s Landing to have a population of approximately one million? Wouldn't it require more modern sanitation and other infrastructure to sustain a population of that size?

Rome had a population of over a million from roughly the time of Caesar (~ 50 BC) to at least the [Plague of Cyprian ](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/plagues-roman-empire/473862/)in 250 and probably all the way down to the [capture of the city by the Goths in 410.](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging) Baghdad, at the height of the Caliphate, and several Chinese cities also reached similar populations down the centuries.

The thing they all had in common was that they were capital cities. Ancient cities could not get that large by simple organic growth: to sustain that kind of population in a pre-industrial era requires the profits of a far-flung empire. Not only could Rome not feed itself — all of Italy and Sicily together were insufficient to sustain the city’s population (which, during the first century, was about the same as the_entire population of the British Isles_ ). It took the massive importation of grain from North Africa and Egypt to keep the city fed and a tremendous (and tremendously expensive) network of aqueducts and sewers to keep the city habitable.

So it was possible for a city to reach the million mark in antiquity — but it was not natural. Only through massive political power could a population that big be brought together, fed, and watered. When the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandal_Kingdom) disrupted the grain routes after conquering North Africa in 435 Rome shrank — rapidly — to a sustainable size, and it would not reach it’s first-century peak again until the 19th century.
