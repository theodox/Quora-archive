The biggest thing to remember about Brown is that you won’t be forced to do the right thing.

For some people that flexibility is a huge benefit, letting them find a really custom experience that suits their goals.

For others — a larger number, I’m afraid — it can be very easy for the lack of structure to translate into a course selections that don’t actually add up to much. Some students just grab course that sound interesting without much thought for how they fit together, leading to a mishmash of random topics that are nice in themselves but don’t build towards anything (or, worse, to a selection of courses designed primarily to avoid challenges or hard work — but since you’re asking the question it’s unlikely you be one of those kids).

My experience there was that about 10–15% of the students benefit enormously from the freedom ability to tailor their course selection to match their personal goals, and about twice as many took advantage of it to give themselves a non-challenging four years. Try to be one of the first group and not the second.

One other thing to to do is to try and get outside of the Brown Bubble. For a lot of reasons Brown students tend not to interact with the surrounding community very much — while it’s not quite as much of an arcology as the University of Chicago or Yale, Brown definitely integrates a lot less with its surroundings than is healthy. Make an effort to get off of College Hill and see the rest of the city and the state.
