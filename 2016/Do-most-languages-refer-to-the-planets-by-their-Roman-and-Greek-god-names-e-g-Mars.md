We use the Roman names in English because they came down to us through the Latin culture of western Europe. The English versions are just localizations of the Latin ones. The same is true for the rest of the Romance languages.

However the Roman's didn't invent the associations themselves: they got if from the Greeks, who in turn got it from the Babylonians. The Babylonians did it this way:


Jupiter = [Marduk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marduk) 

Venus = [Ishtar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishtar) 

Mercury = [Nabu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabu) 

Mars = [Nergal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nergal) 

Saturn = [Ninurta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninurta) 

When the Greeks encountered the much more advanced astronomy of the Near East they found the best matches in their own pantheons for these deities. Sometimes the match is pretty good (Jupiter = Zeus = Marduk, the king of the gods) and sometimes it's a bit of a stretch (Ninurta resembles Saturn/Kronos primarily in that both were associated with the sickle as a symbol). 


Many other cultures picked up astronomy at second hand, either directly from the Babylonians or indirectly via Greece, Rome and the rest of Europe. However there were plenty of completely independent traditions: Egypt and China, for example, had their own schemes which are unrelated to the Babylon > Greece > Rome translation chain.
