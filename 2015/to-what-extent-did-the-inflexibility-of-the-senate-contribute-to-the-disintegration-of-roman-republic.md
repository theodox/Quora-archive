"Inflexibility" is the right concept—but the time scale is rather different. The Senate's fatal failure was not in 69, or 49, but in __133 BC__ .

__Caesar and the Senate__ 

It's true that the final crisis of the Republic was deliberately provoked by the conservative (or, if you prefer, _reactionary_ ) faction in the Senate, particularly by Cato and his allies. Caesar's recall from Gaul wasn't a routine Senatorial decree—it was intended to force Caesar out of political life (or out of life altogether—though the most likely precedent was the comfortable exile of other overly ambitious politicians like [Verres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verres) and [Publius Cornelius Sulla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Cornelius_Sulla)). The reactionaries knew full well that they were risking a civil war by removing Caesar's official immunity and summoning him home to face a highly politicized trial, and during the months leading up to the final rupture the majority of moderate Senators pleaded in vain for some kind of deal to avoid the final reckoning.

However that was not inflexibility that provoked this move: it was _desperation_ . The struggle to save the Republic was lost before Caesar marched off to Gaul. The plot against Caesar was not an effort to _save_  the Republic: it was a last-ditch gamble to _restore_  it. The Roman constitution, such as it was, had been basically abrogated for a decade at that point.

_By 49BC Cato had a lot to be unhappy about..._ 

From 59 to 49 the [first triumivirate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Triumvirate) owned Roman politics. This was not just an informal political alliance between Caesar, Pompey and Crassus: it involved organized political intimidation and the threat of worse: Here, for example, in Plutarch's description of the aftermath of the [Lucca Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucca_Conference) in 56 BC where Caesar, Crassus and Pompey reorganized their racket:

> When, Pompey and Crassus openly announced their candidature, the rest [of the candidates] took fright and withdrew from the contest; but Cato encouraged Domitius, who was a kinsman and friend of his, to proceed, urging and inciting him to cling to his hopes, assured that he would do battle for the common freedom. For it was not the consulate, he said, which Crassus and Pompey wanted, but a tyranny, nor did their course of action mean simply a canvass for office, but rather a seizure of provinces and armies. With such words and such sentiments Cato all but forced Domitius to go down into the forum as a candidate, and many joined their party. Many, too, voiced their amazement thus: "Why, pray, should these men want a second consulship? And why once more together? Why not have other colleagues? Surely there are many men among us who are not unworthy to be colleagues of Pompey and Crassus!" Alarmed at this, the partizans of Crassus and Pompey abstained from no disorder or violence, however extreme, and capped the climax by waylaying Domitius, as he was coming down into the forum before day-break with his followers, killing his torch-bearer, and wounding many, among whom was Cato. After routing their opponents and shutting them up at home, they had themselves proclaimed consuls and a short time afterwards they once more surrounded the rostra with armed men, cast Cato out of the forum, slew several who made resistance, and then had another five years added to the proconsulship of Caesar in Gaul, and the provinces of Syria and both Spains voted to themselves. When the lot was cast, Syria fell to Crassus, and the Spains to Pompey. Plutarch _Crassus_ , 15.

The triumvirs also looked aside while the political gang-leader [Clodius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Clodius_Pulcher) organized routine violence (conveniently aimed at their highest-profile opponents, but discretely deniable).

From 59 to 53, all of the key levers of power were monopolized by the triumvirs: while elections continued and the Senate debated, nothing of consequence could happen without the say-so of the triumvirs. It wasn't exactly a police-state or dictatorship—it was perhaps more like classic Chicago-style machine politics where the forms of representative government swirled peripherally around a solid core of insider deals, topped off with a dash mob violence when people didn't look the other way.

_The first triumvirate: the real government of Rome from 59 to 49._ 

The final crisis of 49 BC was precipitated by Crassus' death at [Carrhae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carrhae) in 53. That turned a relatively stable triumvirate into an unstable duo. Caesar's outsize success in Gaul was clearly threatening Pompey's pre-eminence, so Cato and his allies in the aristocracy began working to manipulate Pompey (who they otherwise despised as an upstart military adventurer) into breaking the alliance which had basically privatized the Republic. Their hope—forlorn, as it turned out—was that the two dynasts would weaken each other and allow the traditional elites to reassert their power. This was more or less the same strategy that many of the survivors of this civil war would try again in the 30s, when Octavian turned up to challenge Marc Anthony's stranglehold over the (briefly) restored Republic.

It didn't work in 49 against Caesar, or in 43 against Antony. The traditional elites were helpless in the face of military dynasts. The _auctoritas_  of the Senate, the majesty of the law, and even the money of the upper classes meant nothing in the face of professional armies who cared more for their generals than for the existing Roman state.

__FDR? Mussolini? Daley?__ 

The view that Caesar was an FDR-style progressive who wanted to save the Republic from itself (that the Senate was 'too inflexible' to solve the state's pressing problems) becomes hard to maintain when one recalls that for more than a decade he and his allies could do _anything they wanted_ , stomping on precedent and tradition without hesitation. What the record shows is that wanted lucrative military commands for themselves and payoffs—in the form of land grants and money—for their soldiers. Large scale improvements in the life of the ordinary people of Italy? Not so much. Caesar was a 'reformer' in the [Richard J. Daley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_J._Daley) mold at best: _reform for me and my friends.*_ 

And in this case, the 'friends' were the soldiers. A given private army might claim to represent the poor (like Marius') or the traditional nobility (like Sulla's) or even make a dubious claim to represent the center (like Caesar's)—but somehow the armies always managed to benefit themselves more than the class or interest they championed.** The social polarization of Italy and the militarization of politics continued throughout this period, killing off what was left of popular government until monarchy seemed like a comfortable, safe alternative.

Caesar definitely cloaked himself in the _[popularis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populares)_  tradition of Marius (and before him, of the Gracchi). But what that really means is hard to pin down. When Caesar or Pompey (or, for that matter, Marius and Sulla) want land for their veterans are they 'really' trying to protect the dispossessed against the plutocrats? Or are they 'really' paying off the armed forces that will guarantee their own power and position? Doing one while pretending the other? Hoping one becomes the other? It's the kind of question one can't answer for modern politicians, much less those dead for two millenia.

But one thing is certain: loyal armed supporters were the ultimate arbiters of late Republican politics. It would be fascinating to know what they thought about it all. Were they loyal clients of the house of the different noble families? Mercenaries with an eye for the biggest payout? Or a political faction in their own right who seized on a convenient figure-head to advance their own agenda? A politicized rabble led by demagogues? Unfortunately they don't get to speak in our sources: we only hear from the aristocrats.

Still, it really is the soldiers—and the calculations of the politician/generals who relied on them—who are the key to question here. The last war of the Republic was the war which killed not just republican, but _civilian_  government at Rome.

__Inflexiblity__ 

The rise of those private armies does, in fact, have a lot to do with reactionary inflexibility. Not Cato's, but the unlovely [Scipio Nasica's.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Cornelius_Scipio_Nasica_Serapio_(consul_138_BC) The historical challenge that the Senate failed to meet wasn't the challenge of Caesar: it was the challenge of [the Gracchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracchi).

Roman victory in the second Punic War, followed by the conquest of the Po valley and the rapid assertion of Roman hegemony throughout the Mediterranean in the generation after [Zama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Zama), upended the social basis of Italy. Untold wealth poured into Rome (and Italy as a whole) but it wasn't shared out equally. The small farmers who formed the backbone of the Roman army and state in the third century BC were increasingly dispossessed in the second: some were war refugees forced into cities; some could not keep up their farms as they campaigned for longer and longer durations outside of Italy; and many lost out to _latifundia_ , industrial scale farms bought with the profits of war and staffed by the massive number of slaves that the wars created.

The net result was, to a significant degree, the loss of the center: the Roman 'middle class' of smallholders shrank and the urban proletariat— poorer and only loosely connected to the institutions and traditions of the state—grew. [Gaius Gracchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Gracchus) and his brother [Tiberius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Gracchus) tried, in the 130s BC, to stem this development with a populist programme of land reform, intended to reverse the drift away from Rome's agrarian roots.

They were murdered for it.

_The Gracchi (a 19th century image: despite their historical importance there are no contemporary portraits or eye-witness accounts of the Gracchi—an example of how spotty ancient sources can be)_ 

Their opponents claimed they were using populist proposals to make themselves tyrants. Their supporters pointed out that their murderers had huge financial stakes in the land which the Gracci proposed to redistribute. Again it's hard to know the truth—but in this case it doesn't matter if the Gracchi were sincere reformers or populist rabble-rousers aiming at tyranny. The problem they articulated was real, and the Senate failed to address it constructively while they were alive or after their deaths.

The murder of Tiberius Gracchus in 133—by a mob of senators led by the sitting _pontifex maximus_ , no less—was a double tragedy. It was the first open political murder in Rome for centuries. And, it guaranteed that nothing would be done to stop the proletarianization of Italy and the rise of the military dynasts. With fewer and fewer opportunities in civilian life, more and more Romans drifted into the professional military where your general was your patron—the source of your wealth and the guarantor of your retirement. The Roman state was just an abstraction. Marius and Sulla, Caesar, Pompey, Antony, Octavian, and everyone ever plopped onto the throne by the Praetorians all owe their careers to Nasica the reactionary. He killed Gracchus with a club, and the Roman Republic with slow-acting poison.

_* Apart from Clodius' grain dole, the best example of 'progressive' legislation from Caesar before his dictatorship was the extension of full Latin rights to Cisalpine Gaul: a positive measure for the region... but also creating a huge number of new voters who lived where Caesar was, effectively, already almost a dictator—and who owed their votes to him. It's also worth remembering that those colonies for veterans (and a favored subsection of the urban poor) were often settled onto unwilling Italians or provincials who were displaced to make way for Romans._ 

_** Maybe the most telling example is the speech which Appian attributes to Brutus after the killing of Caesar: some of it is about liberty and the republic but more than half (2.140 and 2.141) is about land grants for veterans—promising to respect Caesar's grants and to set them on a "more secure footing."_
