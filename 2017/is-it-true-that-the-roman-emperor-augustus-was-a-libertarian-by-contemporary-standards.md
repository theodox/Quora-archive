_No_ Roman emperor — and certainly not one who got the throne by winning a vicious civil war and confiscating the property of his defeated enemies — could describe his philosophy as “[Don't Hurt People and Don't Take Their Stuff.”](http://amzn.to/2lD2Zyp) Roman imperial government was more or less _totalitarian_  by modern standards: on the whole the emperors didn’t recognize the existence of an independent sphere of private life and choice over which they could claim no power.

Augustus, after all, was able to do things like [send the poet Ovid into exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_of_Ovid) for reasons he didn’t even bother to make public (perhaps because Augustus thought his writings were immoral; perhaps because Ovid was mixed up in Augustus’s daughter’s racy lifestyle — in neither case does this seem like principled libertarian respect for the rights of others). Augustus happily interfered with private choices in all sorts of sweeping ways, from forbidding Roman citizens to participate in Druidic religious rites, to [taxing couples who didn’t want children](http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/wlgr/wlgr-romanlegal120.shtml), to [limiting the right of slave owners to free their slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Fufia_Caninia).

To top it all off, Augustus — having defeated Cleopatra and taken her kingdom as a personal possession — was an actual _Pharaoh_ . Egypt was a highly bureaucratized, quasi-socialist plantation state built on a mix of heavy taxation and forced labor service. Egyptians had to get official permission to move from one town to another or to divide their property among their children. Cleopatra was no Ayn Rand.

The likely source for an idea like this is the stark practical limits on government power that every ancient society faced. Augustus created Rome’s first permanent civil service, but it was _very_ small. Outside of Egypt, for his empire of 40 to 50 million people, Augustus had _maybe_ twenty thousand full-time civil servants (the army, of course, also reported to Augustus — but it was mostly stationed on the frontiers after 27 BC). For comparison purposes consider that New York City, with a population of about 8.5 million, has over 450,000 — and they are concentrated in one one-thousandth of the Roman Empire’s land mass. So even if Augustus wanted to meddle in people’s lives his ability to do so was strictly limited by manpower, by communications, and by financial realities.

Even so, the ideal of absolute imperial power remained. It’s hard to imagine Ron Paul demanding this sort of thing be recited by everyone:

> I swear to Zeus, Earth, Sun, all the gods and goddesses, and to Augustus himself, that I will be loyal to Caesar Augustus, his children, and descendants all through my life, both in word, deed, and thought, holding as friends those they hold as friends and considering those as enemies whom they judge to be such, that with regard to things that concern them I will not be sparing of my body or my soul or my life or children, but will face every peril with respect to things that affect them. If there is anything that I should recognize or hear as spoken, plotted, or done contrary to this, I will report this and be an enemy of the person speaking, plotting, or doing any of these things. Whomever they judge to be enemies, I will pursue and defend against them by land and sea with arms and steel.

> If I should do anything contrary to this oath or fail to follow up what I have sworn, I impose a curse upon myself encompassing the destruction and total extinction of my body, soul, life, children, my entire family, and everything essential down to every successor and every descendant of mine, and may neither earth nor sea receive the bodies of my family and descendants nor bear fruit for them.
