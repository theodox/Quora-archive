It derives from French _roman_ , a medieval word for stories written in a local language other than Latin. For example, one of the most famous books of the the Middle Ages was the _[Roman de la Rose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_de_la_Rose)_ _,_  an allegorical love story. By around the 17th century the association of _Roman_  for stories with stories about love, like the _Roman de la Rose,_  was so complete that the word became synonymous with "Love stories".

In the 19th century, [Romanticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism) (capital R) was a reaction to the very rationalist, classical tastes of the 18th century -- it emphasized the passions, the exotic, and the picturesque over the more clinical tastes of the Enlightenment. The word seems to have come from tastes and outlooks found in different national poetries ("romances") , rather than in the stuffy international Latin writing which was still common in previous century. 

We get our uses from a bit of both terms.
