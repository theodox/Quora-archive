# How did the Latin language become part of Rome in the first place? They were the only part of that region of the world where people spoke a Romance language, the first one, how did it get there?

There were a large number of competing but related languages in pre-historic Italy — Latin was simply the one which crowded the others out through political and economic power, although the process took several centuries. Had the Samnites beaten the Romans 2400 years ago rather than the other way round, we might be asking the same question about [Oscan ](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Oscan_language.html)instead of Latin.

Unfortunately our evidence for the prehistory of the Italic languages, including Latin, is rather poor. We have written texts in Greek going back beyond 1400 BC, but the earliest written samples of Italic languages are about 800 years later — this means we have little information about the early evolution of any Italian language. We’re not even sure if the Italian tongues assumed their form inside the peninsula or if they were imported by waves of immigration or conquest.

Modern terminology disguises a reality which was rather messier on the ground: in a hilly country with limited transport (and, in those days, no Roman road network) a “language” could be hyper-local. Latium, the original heartland of the Latin language, is only about about a thousand square miles. Latin’s nearest sister language was [Faliscan ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falisci)— the Faliscan heartland is less than an hour’s drive from downtown Rome. The name “Latin” probably means “the language of the plains,” that is, the language of the less hilly country between the Appenines and the sea where the Romans and their Latin cousins lived. Rome was merely one Latin city-state in its early days — it was the most successful of the ‘cities of the plain’ but not the only one.

Overall, the Italian languages were grouped into two big families: [Latin-Faliscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino-Faliscan_languages) in west central Italy and [Osco-Umbrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osco-Umbrian_languages) in the east and south (along with the unrelated Etruscan language, centered in Tuscany).— depending on how you chose to count there may have been hundreds of languages, on the other hand ancient Italians could probably muddle along with the same kind of messy mutual comprehension you see in the Balkans today.

To give a sense of the similarities in Italic languages, Here’s a sample of Umbrian, from the [Iguvine Tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iguvine_Tablets) — if you follow the blue transliterated text you’ll not several general similarities to Latin in form and vocabulary, such as _enetu_  for begin (like Latin _init_ ) and _aves_ for birds, which is the same as Latin.

The eventual dominance of Latin reflects Roman military and political successes: the old joke that “a language is a dialect with an army” is particularly relevant here. From very early on the Romans specialized in assimilating, rather than erasing, their defeated enemies. Rome defeated and then forced her Latin neighbors to join her in the various wars which eventually unified the peninsula, so the Latin language became the common speech of the conquering alliance. As each new tribe or city was added to the Roman system it became important for local elites and soldiers to learn Latin in order to function in the growing military coalition. It was relatively painless because most of Italy’s languages were already cousins. This helped cement Latin’s position as the language of trade and diplomacy within Italy and eventually all over the western Mediterranean. Modern Romance languages are the surviving fragments — much altered by time and different cultural changes — of that old Latin empire.
