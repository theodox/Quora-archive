Joseph Wang's answer covers the legal basis pretty well. It's also worth considering two additional sources of power which made a big difference in the early empire:



Augustus was the victorious leader of a revolutionary party inside the Roman state. He retained the leadership of the "party" which originally followed Julius Caesar. This meant support inside the senate and other organs of government. It also meant a very powerful source of extra-legal power when it was useful: like a modern revolutionary leader (Mao, Castro, or even Hitler) Augustus found it useful to be able to call on the resources of a huge , organized network of supporters against the legal government, even when nominally in control of the government. 

In the Roman example, this didn't prove necessary. If some hypothetical political rival had displaced him from legal power, Augustus could have called up legions of his own veterans and clients to challenge the official army of the state, exactly as Pompey and Caesar (and before them, Marius and Sulla) had done. But recourse to this power rarely needed, since the Emperor was able to use the office of Censor to remove troublemakers from the Senate. Organized political opposition was rare. When threats arose they were typically from rivals inside the family or from ambitious military commanders. 

Augustus himself and his heirs were personal patrons of huge areas of the empire. They ruled indirectly through a huge network of personal and family connections which covered hundreds of subject states and nations, as well as Roman colonies, veterans groups, and favored families. This was an exaggerated version of the old Roman tradition whereby successful generals and politicians assumed personal responsibility for areas which they had conquered or ruled. 

The patronage network was in part formalized in the division between the "Senatorial" provinces - which were assigned by the Senate in the time-honored fashions to consuls and proconsuls - and "Imperial" provinces which were ruled by the Emperor's legates. The most important parts of the Empire - particularly the key military deployments and the indispensable grain supplies in Egypt and Africa - were Imperial provinces.

The other important aspect of patronage was the late-Republican tradition in which the soldiers tended increasingly to identify with their leaders as individuals and heads of patronal families, rather than as legal representatives of the state. Imperial armies retained the unfortunate habit of serving people rather than the state. When Augustus lamented "Ventidius Varro, give me back my legions" he wasn't kidding: they pretty much were 'his' legions, even though their standards still read SPQR.
