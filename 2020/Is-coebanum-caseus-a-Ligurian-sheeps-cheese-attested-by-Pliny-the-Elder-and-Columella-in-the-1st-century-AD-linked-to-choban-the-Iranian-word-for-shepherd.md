# Is "coebanum caseus", a Ligurian sheep's cheese attested by Pliny the Elder and Columella in the 1st century AD linked to "choban", the Iranian word for shepherd?

As far as I can see it’s a one-off word (it appears as a proper name in Pliny’s Natural History, book 11.97):

> The Alps prove the value of their pastures by two kinds of cheese: the Dalmatian Mountains send the Docleate and the Tarentaise the Vatusic. A larger number belong to the Apennines: these send Coebanum cheese from Liguria, chiefly made of sheep's milk, Sarsina cheese from Umbria, and Luni cheese from the borderland of Tuscany and Liguria

As the internet says <IANL>, in other words “I am not a linguist” so take this all as speculation.

My instinct would be to assume it goes back to a common Indo-European root. If there were an IE root it would be [*owi-](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/_/roots.aspx?type=Indo-European&root=owi-). Perhaps the formation is something like what Latin would express as _cum ove._ I’ve seen that one suggested as the root of _[hoviw](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D5%B0%D5%B8%D5%BE%D5%AB%D6%82)_ _,_ shepherd in Armenian. So if you assume the Ligurians got their word for shepherd from the local flavor of Gaulish, which is an IE language, then there would be no connection to an Iranic word except through the medium of proto-Indo-European.

OTOH Several _other_ languages also have words similar to _choban_  for shepherds — for example, _cioban_  is shepherd in Romanian. I’ve [seen it suggested](http://www.continuitas.org/texts/alinei_interdisciplinary.pdf) that this is ultimately derived from a Turkic root _çoban_ which is how it ends up as _tsopánis_  in Greek and _çobán_ in Albanian. The article linked above comes from a somewhat radical camp which claims that _cioban/tsopánis /çobán/çoban_ was not — as you’d expect — an Ottoman era importation but a very old one going back to the very early history of Indo-European languages in Europe. This is part of a larger “Palaeolithic continuity theory” which suggests that IE languages were present in Europe much earlier than is usually thought and the Turkic root came in at that very early date. I’ts not a majority view in linguistics — however if it were correct then the connection to an Iranian version probably arises in the same way.

Of course it’s also possible that there’s an just accidental sound connection. We don’t have a strong consensus on the nature of the actual Ligurian language. So we might be seeing a Latin speaker’s transliteration of a Gallic speaker’s interpretation of a Ligurian word that has nothing to do with sheep and is just a place-name.
