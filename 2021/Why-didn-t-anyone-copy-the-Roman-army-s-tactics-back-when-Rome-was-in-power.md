# Why didn’t anyone copy the Roman army’s tactics back when Rome was in power?

The Romans were in fact master copiers themselves: their willingness to borrow successful innovations from others was one of their great competitive advantages.

The standard Roman helmet (the [Montefortino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montefortino_helmet), with its distinctive cheek flaps) was borrowed from the Gauls of northern Italy. The Roman gladius was copied from the Celtiberians of Hispania. The oval scutum (not the later semi-cylindrical design) seems to have been ubiquitous in Italy from the third century BC on. They built their first navy by reverse-engineering captured Carthaginian warships.

It’s probably smarter to think of “Italian tactics” rather than “Roman” ones, at least during the period when Rome was confronting enemies operating in a similar military band (rather than, say, naked tribesmen in Scotland or horse nomads from the steppes) . In fact, the classic Roman style of warfare — the manipular legion which defeated Hannibal, Philip V, Antiochus III and Mithradates of Pontus — wasn’t really a Roman invention. Rather, it was an adaptation of the fighting style of the [Samnites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samnites), who were Rome’s bitterest rivals in central Italy in the fourth and third centuries BC.

Part of that willingness to copy stems from the fact that “Roman” armies were usually Roman only by a scant majority. The Roman system in a lot of ways was kind of like a forced alliance structure in which defeated enemies were recycled as Roman allies, known as _[socii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socii)_ . Before the end of the Social War* in 87 BC a typical Roman battlefield force would have about half of it’s ranks made up of allied troops — these served under Roman overall command but followed their own leaders in ethnic units; before the latter half of the second century BC this was a necessity since many of the allied troops won’t have spoken Latin. They had to complement the Roman core of the army but there was no common training or equipment; each contingent fought in its own way.

All that said: Roman success on the battlefields did draw notice, and some of Rome’s enemies did make an effort to copy the Italic infantry format which served Rome so well.

[Pyrrhus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus)made use of Samnite infantry in line with his phalanxes at [Ausculum ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Asculum)in 279 (when he returned in 275 without significant Italian allies, he lost at [Beneventum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Beneventum_(275_BC)). Hannibal of course fleshed out his army with Italians wherever he could, and after long contact with Italian tactics his [Libyan troops were equipped in Italian style](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D114).

There is a lot of debate among military historians about the degree to which the Hellenistic [thureophoroi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyreophoroi) and [thorakitai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorakitai) represent copies of the Italic model (some argue for a Celtic origin, others for multiple sources) but they were certainly much more similar to the Italic style of equipment than, say, the traditional Macedonian phalanx.

The most famous imitator was the Seleucid [Antiochus IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes), who grew up as a diplomatic hostage at Rome and deliberately [created a unit of 5,000 infantry “armed in the Roman fashion, with their coats made of mail“ fashion in 166 BC](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D31%3Achapter%3D3). However Rome’s other eastern enemy, [Mithridates of Pontus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_VI_Eupator) also made a very deliberate effort to imitate Roman warfighting:

> [Mithridates] did away with Barbarous hordes from every clime, and all their discordant and threatening cries; he provided no more armour inlaid with gold and set with precious stones, for he saw that these made rich booty for the victors, but gave no strength whatever to their wearers; instead, he had swords forged in the Roman fashion, and heavy shields welded… and a hundred and twenty thousand footmen drilled in the Roman phalanx formation

One thing none of our sources really comment on is the degree to which the imitation legions borrowed Italic tactics as well as arms: while the two are necessarily related, in the long run its military tradition and culture rather than simply equipage which dictates the way wars are fought. It’s far from clear how much of that was consciously adopted by Rome’s neighbors. To some degree it may simply not have been possible: before the reforms of Marius, the republican legions and their socii were tightly rooted in the Italian countryside of small cities, fairly close local elites, and relatively prosperous peasants. In the colonial empires of Egypt and Syria or in the more politically fractured world of mainland Greece there was no obvious social analog, which may have rendered the entire enterprise much more difficult than it seems.
