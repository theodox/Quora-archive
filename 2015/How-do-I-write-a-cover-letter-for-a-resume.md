Although [this blog post](http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/search?q=read+the+damn+ad) is about cover letters and resumes for the games industry, the general point is pretty universal. A cover letter is a chance to (a) show you've read the ad and think you are the kind of person the company is looking for and (b) prove that you've got enough communications skills not to flub the cover letter test.
