This is an interesting one. A lot would depend on the person: I suspect that a lot of people would suddenly discover that their grasp of many of the capstone ideas of modernity — particularly the practical ones that might be extremely useful in such a scenario — is actually pretty shaky. Even skipping over language issues, my bet is that few of us will come out looking like wizardly geniuses once we arrive without internet connections, calculators, or even a second hand set of the Encyclopedia Britannica.

To take myself for an example, I’ll work through what I’d try without doing any reference lookups of any kind. I’m also going to skip out on any ‘predict the future’ stuff for the simple reason that 1 AD a few years from the next big ‘datable’ event I could fake-predict (the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD) -and if I haven’t changed the future by that point I’m doing a lousy job.

The very first thing I’d want to do would be to get __paper__  and __movable type__ going. Not only would it be a good way to earn some money without being so obviously magical that I’d be on the radar of the wrong people, it would also be an incomparable benefit for the future: given that easily 90% of everything ever written in antiquity is lost, mostly due to the expense of constantly recopying books by hand, I’d feel my time-travel adventure was justified if I could get printing going in the first century.* Plus, it’s something that, as a not particularly handy layman I think I understand. Blocks with letter shapes, a machine to clamp them onto paper, and paper. I know that much.

Or do I?

The blocks of metal with type on them - well that part’s easy. Except that I’ll need to figure out how to get them made: are they cast? or carved? I think its cast. Lead, yes? But — am I going to get lead poisoning? And will lead hold up or do I need to use something harder?

And then I have to get them made into an actual press. I think I could work that out with local materials — I’m pretty sure that olive presses or wine presses in the first century used a screw mechanism. After I’ve got some stuff printed I’ll look into something fancier, though I’ll have to find (or more likely _buy_ ) a skilled machinist to put anything really fancy together.

Then the paper. I’m pretty sure I can undercut imported papyrus or local vellum which are both pretty expensive. But paper… what’s it really made of these days? Is wood pulp alone all you need? what kind of wood? How do you roll it out and flatten it? And there’s rags involved somehow, I dated somebody who made paper 30 years ago and I’m sure there were rags involved.

Oh — and how do you make ink? I think I can get that by asking around, but I bet the stuff the scribes use won’t work right off.

So now I’m already three, or maybe four, research projects in on my _easy_ project. I’m pretty sure I can do this — assuming I have some way to keep eating.

Here, at least, I think I have one definite modern advantage: I’ve watched enough Silicon Valley to know I need a __business plan.__ I think I can crack this in stages: first, do wood-block type on existing papyrus. Do something really simple — maybe doing fair copies of poems for the literati, or if that doesn’t work out something like advertising flyers to get a revenue stream going. Use that to fund research on paper, which will sell both with printing and, once it’s familiar, as a commodity. Only then take on the fancy mechanical work.

Give me a year without dying of dysentery and I’ve changed the world!

Side project: __Punctuation__ . Romans WRITELIKETHISWITHNOSPACESORPUNCTUATIONMARKSITSVERYHARDTOREAD. Popularizing punctuation and spacing will be a big help to popular literacy in the future. I think for this one I’d look up Tiro — the inventor of shorthand — who should still be alive (he lived to be 100). I think he’d appreciate this one.

Another side project is __Arabic numerals__ . Nowadays we generally think that abaci were good enough that the zero and digits were not the quantum leap the old history texts claimed — but it’s still a win.

One last paper project: the __codex__ , that is, the modern book as opposed to the scroll. It’s a natural complement to printing, and it’s also much more survivable and space-efficient. Another gift to the future. I haven’t done book binding but I think I could hack it up.

But all this is not sexy enough. Now the paper business has a bit of money coming in, I want something cool and sciency. Like…

What?

I saw that Star Trek episode, where Captain Kirk makes __gunpowder__  out of charcoal, sulfur, and salt-peter (which I think is a crystal that forms in pig dung. I’d need to figure out how to ask that in Latin very, very carefully). If I could be sure to figure that out and had enough time to fiddle with the proportions I could probably work it out — but this paragraph is pretty much the sum total of what I know on that score. This, I think, is the real nub of the problem: like a lot of clever moderns I don’t _need_  to know how to do this — I can just look it up. Except it’s hard to do that when my MacBook is 2015 years in the future. Gunpowder is going to be an ongoing skunkworks project; I’m not going to conquer the empire with it.

On the other hand I could probably do a __magnetic compass,__ if I can find a source of lodestones. But it would take a lot of asking around: magnetism doesn’t become a hot topic in Europe for another millenium and a half. That, however, would definitely be salable.

Also doable: __Lightning Rods.__  That’s one I know I can do and it will also save a lot of lives. The hard part will be figuring out how to get the idea out there: the popular-science press of the 18th century has no Roman counterpart. I think the smart thing to do is to ‘discover’ a ‘lost manuscript’ of some known but obscure Greek natural philosopher and insert it there, rather than claiming to invent it myself. Otherwise it’s a hard sell.

I’m less sure about __magnifying glasses__ . The golden days of the Roman glass industry are yet to come — there’s going to be a huge uptick in glass production over the next century. _If_  I could get a decent starting point — most Roman glass is colored to hide the impurities — I think I could probably work out a magnifying lens by trial and error — I think I could probably find a metalworker who could teach me how where to get the right kind of grit to grind the lenses down without making them too opaque to be useful. Once the lenses are done I could also do __telescopes__ and __microscopes.__ If the lens project works out it might be possible to kick start the __germ theory of disease,__ though that would almost certainly take so long to spread that I’d never see much in the way of practical results. Telescopes, though, will be big sellers: the practical uses are too obvious to ignore.

Along the way I’m definitely working hard to find a patron. I think the ‘amaze the natives’ strategy — trying to convince people I’ve got supernatural powers — is highly unlikely to work. But finding a well connected member of the upper classes is key: somebody to introduce you to the right people, provide political cover, and make sure your innovations are seen as fashionable rather than threatening.

And if my patron is sufficiently powerful, I’d see if I can get ol’ Augustus to create __patent law__ . The Romans didn’t do patents —that’s a Renaissance invention. This didn’t mean a lot of open-source sharing: it meant that lots of important stuff was deliberately kept secret. If it were possible to get a decent patent regime up and running (a really _good_  patron will get my printing outfit the contract for printing up the official copies of the patent applications!) not only will I have a much easier time monetizing my “inventions” but the future will not lose all sorts of great things because they’ll be written down.

Unfortunately at this point I’m really running out of low-hanging fruit. I know that in theory the __seed drill__ is going to be one of the great drivers of Chinese agricultural prosperity. If I knew how a seed drill actually _worked_ , I’d invent one. But I don’t. Another skunk works job. I will, however, try to figure out some way to smuggle __silkworms__  out of China — if I can do that I’ll have plenty of R&D money, that trick basically floated the Byzantine Empire for 500 years.

I understand the theory of how a __barometer__  works but I don’t know how to get liquid mercury in Rome — or if I want to risk mercury poisoning to try it. __Canned food__  is another risky one: in theory it would work but one mistake would get some people killed. At least I would not use lead solder, but I don’t know how to avoid botulism!

There’s a million things that _might_  work: the mechanical __crossbow__ , for example. Stern-post __rudders__  for ships, along with __lateen sails.__ I know the story about the __horse-collar__  revolutionizing medieval agriculture, but apart from it being a big padded ring I know nothing about it: who’s going to build it for me? I know that __stirrups__  are supposed to be a big bonus for cavalry, but my impression is that modern saddles are fantastically complex and I know nothing about them (I honestly don’t recall without looking it up if Romans used __horseshoes__ : if they don’t I wonder if I could sell them on the idea). The problem with all of these kinds of things is that I —with little more to go one than some half remembered book illustrations — have to figure out a way to sell them to professionals brought up in a different tradition who know their business perfectly well. I’m an outsider trying to tell the pros — who are the very people I need to implement my wild ideas — that they’re doing it all wrong. Unless I’m phenomenally lucky I’ll just be laughed at. I’ll be the Nikola Tesla of the 1st century.

I know the basics of mechanics so I can _imagine_  a lot of cool automation: belts and pulleys and gears are all things I can contract out. But I have no idea if I can actually use them to out-compete slave labor in 1st century conditions. They only way to know is to try… which will only work if I can afford the up-front investments. It’s all drearily modern.

Most technology is embedded in a social and economic context. You can have the right idea and still be unable to get it into people’s hands for all sorts of reasons: politics, business, social taboos or just marketing failures. And, when you don’t actually know how to _implement_ the idea you run the risk of looking like a crank. I get the basic principles behind the __steam engine,__  but so did Hiero of Alexandria. All he ever did with it was some gimmicky demos: it would not find a practical application for nearly two thousand years.
