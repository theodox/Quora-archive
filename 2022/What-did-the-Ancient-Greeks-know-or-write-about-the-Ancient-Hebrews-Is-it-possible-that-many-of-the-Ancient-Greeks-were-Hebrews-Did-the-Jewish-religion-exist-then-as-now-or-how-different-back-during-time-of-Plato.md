# What did the Ancient "Greeks" know or write about the Ancient "Hebrews"? Is it possible that many of the Ancient "Greeks" were "Hebrews"? Did the Jewish religion exist then as now or how different back during time of Plato, for example?

The were contemporary and they knew of each other but not intimately until well after the time of Alexander the Great. Their distinct societies had little enough in common that their relations were not always amicable.

_A general idea of the synchronism between Jewish and Greek history. All dates above BC except as noted._ 

During the early part of what in Greece was the classical era — around, say, 500 BC — Judea was still recovering from mass deportations (the “[Babylonian captivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity)”) and was not a particularly prosperous place. Jerusalem was rebuilt during this period as a Persian provincial capital. This was also the era [when Judaism began to assume its modern form](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-there-no-reference-to-Judaism-before-the-time-of-Ezra-the-Scribe/answer/Steve-Theodore). The odds are good (though, to be clear, there are no sources which specifically call this out) that the Persian army which invaded Greece in 480 included Jewish levies: we know that the Persians were happy to use Jewish troops to garrison Egypt around the same time.

With Judaea a fairly impoverished part of the vast Persian empire, it’s not surprising that Jews didn’t loom very large in Greek imagination. Plato and Aristotle never mention Judaism, though neither of them ever shows much interest in the cultures of the Near East. It’s probable that the oldest Greek mention of Jews is a single sentence in the historian Herodotus mentioning “[Syrians who practice circumcision.](https://www.quora.com/What-did-the-Greek-historian-Herodotus-refer-to-the-Jews-as/answer/Steve-Theodore)” [Clearchus of Soli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearchus_of_Soli), a student of Aristotle’s, wrote that his master actually met a Jew and was impressed by his philosophical acumen; on the other hand he also said the Judaism was a branch of Indian philosophy so perhaps the discussion did not go particularly deep.

After Alexander Greeks became familiar with a much wider and more diverse world — including Judaea, which became part of Alexander’s empire in 332–1. The first detailed account is from Hecataeus of Abdera, around 300 BC, who included a version of the Exodus story in his history of Egypt. Around the same time another pupil of Aristotle’s, [Theophrastus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastus), described Jews as “a nation of philosophers” but again he’s rather hazy on the details.

Over the next three centuries Greek-Jewish relations varied from mutual curiosity to active hostility. Generally after about the middle of the second century BC relations soured after the Greek Seleucid empire (a fragment of Alexander’s old territories) attempted to impose Hellenism in Judaea. The war which followed led to the birth of a new Jewish state but it also created a general climate of mutual distrust between Greeks and Jews. The general arc of Greek opinions about Judaism is covered in [this answer](https://www.quora.com/Are-the-traditional-accounts-of-Judeo-Greek-Judeo-Roman-relations-pre-Christian-realistic-and-consistent-Why-are-most-sources-Jewish-are-there-detailed-counterparts-from-the-Greek-or-Roman-perspective/answer/Steve-Theodore), which covers most of the major early mentions.

_A_ _[Judaean coin of Alexander Jannaeus.](https://www.vcoins.com/en/stores/athena_numismatics/18/product/judaea_hasmoneans_alexander_jannaeus_10376_bce_stunning_example_/1339318/Default.aspx)_ _, around 100 BC. On the face the Hebrew inscription “Yonatan the king”, and the reverse the Greek inscription (here partly damaged) [ΑΛΕ]ΧΑΝΔΡΟΥ ΒΑΣΙ[ΛΕΩΣ]_ ___,___ _“of King Alexander”._ 

Both Greeks and Jews ended up subjects of the Roman empire. The Romans inherited the generally negative Greek attitude toward Jews, starting with large-scale violence against Jews in Egypt and culminating in[ the destruction of Jerusalem and the second Temple in 70](https://www.britannica.com/event/First-Jewish-Revolt) and the nearly genocidal [Kitos War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War) in the early second century.

Throughout this long era — it’s almost a thousand years from the “first contact” in Alexander’s time to the rise of Islam — there were people who managed to survive with a foot in both cultures. There were many Jews who assimilated into the surrounding Greek culture in whole or in part, but Judaism [also gained adherents in the Greek world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God-fearer). The violent conflicts were one part of a complex picture which included cross-cultural borrowings, assimilation, and re-adaptation on both sides.

In closing, one would be remiss in addressing this question without mentioning the fact that, according to the Bible — at least, if your Bible includes the book of Maccabees — [the Spartans were Jewish.](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-facts-about-Spartans) Maccabees contains a letter from Areus, King of Sparta (309–265 BC) asserting ancestral kinship with the Jews. Although very few people ([apart from this one](https://armstronginstitute.org/264-the-spartans-children-of-abraham-brothers-of-the-jews)) take this assertion at face value it certainly illustrates that both Greeks and Jews were aware of each other as contemporaries.
