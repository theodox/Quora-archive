It’s really hard to quantify this because there are so many variables:

Are you counting just access to precious metals, or command over labor?

Are you trying to adjust for the prices of different things at different times?

Do you include both “personal” and “state” resources when counting kings?

If you’re counting labor, Is the labor of a million illiterate peasants worth more than the labor of ten thousand highly trained engineers?

And all that’s even before you get to the contradictory and fragmentary ancient sources

A good candidate, certainly for his own period in time, would be Alexander the Great who briefly exercised personal control over pretty much everything from Egypt to the northern India. This answer tries to calculate his wealth in modern terms and comes up with two different estimates: one based purely on money wealth and one based on purchasing power. But — such is modernity — in neither example does conquering the heart of Eurasia net you the same kind of money as purveying online shopping or selling overpriced phones
