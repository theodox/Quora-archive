Ancient Mesopotamia was generally always multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multilingual. Throughout Mesopotamian history different waves of invasion from all directions have brought lots of outsiders into the region; those groups definitely included people from the Arabian peninsula; but the core of Mesopotamian civilization was built in the region by speakers of other languages. The Arabs as we know them are very late comers to the area: they arrived in force only 1400 years ago, when Mesopotamian civilization was already 3500 years old. However Arab or proto-Arab communities on the fringes of Mesopotamia were always important parts of the Mesopotamian world, from very early contacts with [Dilmun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilmun) to trading kingdoms like [Palmyra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra). 

The earliest urban settlements were Sumerian -- speaking a language with no obvious relations to any modern language. By around 2500 BC Sumerian was overtaken by Akkadian as the main language of the region -- Akkadian being an eastern Semitic language related to, but not directly ancestral to Arabic. By around 900 BC Aramaic, a western Semitic language closely related to biblical Hebrew was the dominant language of the Assyrian empire, and it became the language of business and administration throughout the Near East but especially in the Tigris-Euphrates valley. Aramaic (coexisting with Persian and Greek for trade and politics) remained the main language until the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia in 7th century of our era. 

Most Iraqis are probably not 'Arabs' by descent, although like many Arabic speakers they self-identify as Arabs. The [Assyrian minority in Iraq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrians_in_Iraq) claim to be the direct descendants of the Assyrian inhabitants of Mesopotamia, much as the [Copts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copts) are the direct descendants of the ancient Egyptians. Some Assyrians still speak [Syriac ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_language)or Neo-Aramaic today, and they do have somewhat different genetics from many of their neighbors. It's not clear if the [Marsh Arabs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_Arabs) are descendants of the ancient Sumerians or if they are latecomers to the region.
