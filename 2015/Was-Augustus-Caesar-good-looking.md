The conventional representations, such as the [Augustus of Prima Porta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_of_Prima_Porta), are all pretty flattering. The casting of Roddy McDowell in _Cleopatra_  seems to have been based on these:

The calm expression and regular features are deliberate design decisions. Augustus's imagery also borrowed a lot from traditional representations of Apollo:
