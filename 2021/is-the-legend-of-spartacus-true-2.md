It’s real, and quite well attested by the fairly low standards of ancient history.

The primary written records are significantly later than Spartacus lifetime (his revolt is dated 73 to 71 BC). Our modern narratives are based primarily on the writings of [Appian](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/appian/appian-spartacus/), [Florus](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/florus/florus-on-spartacus/), and [Plutarch](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/plutarch/plutarchs-crassus/plutarch-on-spartacus/) — all writing from between 150 and 225 years after the events they describe. However the level of detail and coherence in all three stories indicates that they all used good sources much closer to the events they describe: the most usual candidates are a [Sallust ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallust)and [Livy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livy), who both wrote histories of this period from a near contemporary perspective (Sallust would have been in his early teens when Spartacus was active).

There is one truly contemporary reference: an offhand mention in Cicero ([Against Verres, 2.5.2](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0018%3Atext%3DVer.%3Aactio%3D2%3Abook%3D5)) , written three years after the end of war, in which he accuses a corrupt governor of Roman Sicily of trying to claim credit for the defeat of fugitive slaves in Italy and attributing victory to Crassus and Pompey. Cicero. In a [different, later speech](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Cic.%20Phil.%204.6.15&lang=original) Cicero called Marc Antony “an assassin, a robber, a Spartacus”. This insult, written a generation after the end of the war, is the oldest surviving of Spartacus by name.

So there’s no reason to doubt the historicity of Spartacus’ revolt, though there are disagreements and vague spots in our historical record.

_This isn’t exactly archaeological “proof” for Spartacus. However this coin, issued in the name of Marcus Arrius Secundus (in 43 BC) is believed to record a heroic feat of his ancestor, Quintus Arrius, who defeated one of Spartactus’ lieutenants in 72 BC.

It’s a great sidelight on the nature of our sources that this event, which took place in the heart of Italy, during on of the most well-documented parts of Roman history, within the lifespan of several figures we know well — Julius Caesar, Cicero, Crassus to name a few — survives almost entirely in accounts written centuries later.
