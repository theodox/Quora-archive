For the specific case in the article linked this is an example of why you need to follow links instead of reading the headlines.

The reconstructed image here…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fd3f9ac806fb73a026959c34079e8f23)

was created using 3d scan data from the mummy for its geometry __but using__ __[this Egyptian original](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertiti_Bust)__ __as its guide for color__ , as the[ team responsible for it said in their press release.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/could-this-be-the-face-of-nefertiti-300593330.html)

If you look at the [obvious google image search](https://www.google.com/search?biw=853&bih=484&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=rU19Wo-TE8H25gLKuo2QAw&q=nefertiti+bust+berlin&oq=nefertiti+bust+berlin&gs_l=psy-ab.3...24563.25640.0.25904.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.y5v7wXNJUxw#imgrc=3n4yL7aJOYhiUM:) you will get a good example of how much different combinations of lighting and photographic technique affect perception of color and contrast — a fact which the Twitterverse seems not to give a good god damn about:

How well does the reconstruction match the original? What kind of work was put into trying to compensate for, say, the limited palette available to the Egyptian artist? Your guess is as good as mine. But it’s a _guess_ , unless somebody provides actual evidence.

Which the discussion about this stuff is very short on.

While we’re at it, how about the problems of dealing with ancient art in general? This is [another original Nefertiti](https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/akhenaton-and-nefertiti), with her husband Akhenaten. What are we to make of _these_  color choices?*

This is not just an example of how hard it is to pin down the looks of all ancient Egyptians. This is supposed to be _the_  _same individual._ Maybe Egyptian artists had technical issues with skin tones; maybe they had conventions that drove their choices that weren’t realistic; maybe they were just artists, doing what they wanted to do. Figuring out what somebody who lived 3,300 years before the invention of color photography looked like is ___hard___ _._ What “color” was Nefertiti really? __We don’t know.__ 

Professionals understand that. It’s only people with an axe to grind who claim to be certain.

However, since [the sculptor](http://www.daynes.com/en/hominids-reconstructions.html) who created the reconstruction had previously done a reconstruction of Nefertiti’s stepson/cousin (it’s [complicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun)), king Tut, [for the Egyptian Department of Antiquities](http://www.guardians.net/hawass/Press_Release_05-05_Tut_Reconstruction.htm) — which presumably has no reason to ‘whitewash’ their own history — I would start by assuming that she actually tried to do her best with based on the data she had. According to published reports, she based her Tut on the skin tones of modern Egyptians; it’s a good guess that the Nefertiti was made the same way. It’s not as if the course of this tweet-storm was not drearily predictable.

Here, by the way, is another of her historical recreations from Egypt:

[This article](http://Since the sculptor who created the reconstruction had previously done a reconstruction of Nefertiti’s son, king Tut, for the Egyptian Department of Antiquities (http://www.guardians.net/hawass/Press_Release_05-05_Tut_Reconstruction.htm) which presumably has no reason to ‘Europeanize’ their own history, I would start by assuming that she cared about the evidence. ) offers a critique of the reconstruction— but unlike the lazy, mealymouthed article in Newsweek it contains actual facts instead of recycled tweets.



* Incidentally, here’s a good way to tell if people have done their homework. You’ll probably find these if you image-google Nefertiti:

But it’s not her.

It’s [Nefetari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QV66) — a different queen. It’s written right there on the wall.
