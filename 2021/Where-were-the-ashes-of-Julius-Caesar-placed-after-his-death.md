It’s actually a bit of a mystery.

It’s generally known that his funeral turned into a kind of mass demonstration, and the result was… messier…. than a traditional Roman pyre.

> The bier on the rostra was carried to the Forum by magistrates and ex-magistrates. While some were urging that it be burned in the temple of Jupiter of the Capitol, and others in the Hall of Pompey, on a sudden two beings with swords by their sides and brandishing a pair of darts set fire to it with blazing torches, and at once the throng of bystanders heaped upon it dry branches, the judgment seats with the benches, and whatever else could serve as an offering. Then the musicians and actors tore off their robes, which they had taken from the equipment of his triumphs and put on for the occasion, rent them to bits and threw them into the flames, and the veterans of the legions the arms with which they had adorned themselves for the funeral. Many of the women, too, offered up the jewels which they wore and the amulets and robes of their children.

> At the height of the public grief a throng of foreigners went about lamenting each after the fashion of his country, above all the Jews, who even flocked to the place for several successive nights.

The other accounts vary somewhat in detail, but all agree that the cremation was not done according to tradition: in fact, a cremation within the forum was illegal and nominally impious. Caesar’s impromptu pyre recalled the [similarly anarchic funeral for the radical populist Clodius eight years earlier](https://imperiumromanum.pl/en/curiosities/death-of-clodius-and-riots-in-rome/), which ended with the incineration of the [Curia Hostilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curia_Hostilia). The crowds who burned Caesar body were in the shadow of the construction site of the Curia Julia which Caesar had been building to replace the older structure. They were [certainly aware of the political symbolism involved](https://www.academia.edu/11096308/Topography_and_Ideology_Caesars_Monument_and_the_Aedes_Divi_Julii_in_Augustan_Rome).

One later source (Appian, writing about a hundred and fifty years later) claims that Caesar’s bones were recovered by his freedmen and taken to the family tomb. However the usual account is that Caesar’s remains — which would have been hard to separate from the remnants of a huge public bonfire lasting several days — were interred on the spot, in the Roman forum just in front of the [Regia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regia), which had been Caesar’s official residence as Pontifex Maximus. A different late source ([Cassius Dio](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cassius_dio/44*.html)) says that Caesar’s supporters had already passed a law allowing him to have a tomb within the city’s sacred boundaries, an extraordinary honor shared only with legendary kings and the early republican (and populist) heroes [Publicola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Valerius_Poplicola#Death) and [Postimius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Postumius_Tubertus).

So, it’s possible that some relics of the dictator were moved to a family tomb in the immediate aftermath of the funeral, but it’s far from certain. If they were moved, they are lost to history since we have never identified the tombs of the gens Julia. In any event, though, its clear that it was the site of the pyre became very quickly the epicenter for the veneration of Caesar as a _divus —_ not quite a god on the level of Jupiter or Mars, but an immortal worthy of sacrifices and prayers. Within a few weeks of the assassination there was already an impromptu alter on the site. Antony at first tried to remove the memorial, which was illegal (Roman law was extremely harsh on unsanctioned religious expression) but by the summer of the 44 BC the Caesarian party with Octavian at its head was too politically potent to overrule.

The coincidental appearance of a [comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_Comet) in July seemed to provide divine sanction to the idea that Caesar had ascended into the heavens. Octavian added a statue of Caesar, adorned with a star symbolizing his divinity, to the site of the popular memorial. The Caesarian faithful used the site to swear oaths and leave offerings. When Octavian and Antony joined forces to create the [Second Triumvirate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Triumvirate), one of their first official acts was to formally ratify the deification of Caesar and to [vow the building of a temple on the spot of his cremation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Caesar)

The completion of the temple took several years. The other triumvirs wanted to placate the fervor of Caesar’s supporters, but since Octavian was the only human beneficiary of Caesar’s cult his political partners were not unduly eager to actually complete the authorized construction. The groundwork was probably only laid in 32 or 31, and the building was only completed and dedicated in 29, after the defeat of Antony and Octavian’s final assumption of complete power in Rome.

The temple — and, presumably, whatever remains of Caesar — is still there at the eastern end the Forum, between the [Temple of the Dioscuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Castor_and_Pollux) and the [Temple of Antoninus and Faustina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Antoninus_and_Faustina) (the modern [San Lorenzo in Miranda](https://romanchurches.fandom.com/wiki/San_Lorenzo_in_Miranda)) .

Unfortunately it’s one of the less prepossessing ruins in the area, and most of what we see today is the brick-and-concrete substructure which once housed a traditional temple faced in marble. The forum was crowded, so the temple was built on a tall pedestal to make it more imposing despite it’s relatively modest footprint.

The semicircular niche in the temple foundation surrounds the base of what was once a round altar in front of the temple. It’s believe to be the site Caesar’s pyre, and [attracts a lot of flowers and other offerings from tourists (and, rumor has it, from monarchist and fascist groups).](http://www.mmdtkw.org/VTempleCaesar.html)
