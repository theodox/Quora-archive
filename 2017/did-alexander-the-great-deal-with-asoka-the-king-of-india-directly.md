No, they did not overlap in time.

However Ashoka did interact with the different Greek states which grew up in Alexander’s wake, particularly with the [Seleucid Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire) (under [Antiochus II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_II_Theos)). Ashoka’s empire also included the Greek cities of [Gandhara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhara), which were part of the territory that Ashoka inherited from his grandfather [Chandragupta Maurya ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_Maurya); we have the texts of several of his edicts in Greek, such as [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_Greek_Edict_of_Ashoka):

Which was found in Kandahar, Afghanistan.
