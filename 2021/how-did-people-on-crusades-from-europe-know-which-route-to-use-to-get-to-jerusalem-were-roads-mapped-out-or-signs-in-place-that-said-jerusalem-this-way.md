# How did people on crusades from Europe know which route to use to get to Jerusalem? Were roads mapped out or signs in place that said Jerusalem this way?

Although there had been occasional interruptions, there had been a continuous tradition of European pilgrims visiting the Holy Land since Late Roman times. The oldest account of a pilgrimage route, the _[Itinerarium Burdigalense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itinerarium_Burdigalense)_ _,_ dates back all the way to 333. For a long time the _[De Locis Sanctis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_locis_sanctis)_ _,_ transcribed by an Irish monk in 798 who interviewed a Frankish pilgrim, was a popular description of the Holy Land — it even included a map of Jerusalem. The [Itinerarium Bernardi monachi franci](https://medievalworlds.net/0xc1aa5576%200x003b0da8.pdf) (“Itinerary of Bernard the French monk”) from 867 was the last example from before the Crusades we still possess, though it’s likely that there were more of which we have no record.

After the first crusade, which was the talk of Europe, there were many newer and more up-to-date guides and histories which provided guidance — and, of course, there was the network of commerce that sustained the Latin states of Outremer and which was eminently practical. Good quality information became comparatively easy to find: the [Descriptio Terrae Sanctae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burchard_of_Mount_Sion) of Burchard, for example, is still popular with modern scholars; it circulated widely, in illustrated versions with maps and drawings. You can get a sense however of how widely disseminated the information could be among those who needed it from the career of [Daniel The Traveller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_the_Traveller), a Russian monk who visited the Crusader kingdoms in 1104.

On top of all that, of course, pilgrims and crusaders certainly had the obvious option of asking directions. Daniel’s book about his travels notes “it is impossible to come to know all the holy places without guides and interpreters.”
