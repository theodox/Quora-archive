It's only fair in a very hand-wavey, inexact kind of way.

Gladiators were somewhat like modern athletes in that they sometimes attained a degree of celebrity. However they were not volunteers, except in very unusual (and mostly scandalous) cases: most were condemned criminals or slaves. They certainly weren't millionaires.

The 'distracting the masses part' is a tough sell on both ends. The old line about _panem et circenses_ ("[bread and circuses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses)") comes from the satirist [Juvenal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenal), who wasn't a political theorist but who did have a cynical eye for some Roman realities. But he wasn't complaining about the politicians, he was complaining about the common people who preferred free food and shows to civic duty. The politicians weren't using entertainment to keep the masses from seizing power: the masses were squeezing some social services out of a system that otherwise didn't do much for them.

 In republican times Roman politicians, provided entertainment (gladiatorial shows, but also theatrical performances, festivals and free meals) to curry favor with voters. This wasn't so much distractions as straight-out bribery: it has more in common with 19th c. American politicians who offered picnics and whiskey to voters than with [Wag the Dog](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120885/). In both the Roman and American versions, there was a lively trade outside of election season too: entertainment was never a government monopoly.

In imperial times the tradition continued, but the decline of competitive politics left the emperors as the primary contributors. However the character of the system also changed: courting the electorate wasn't necessary, but riot control sometimes was. The old republican system at least allowed the people some bargaining power: although the votes of the poor were heavily diluted they did count in close races. Under the empire there was no avenue for complaints or demands apart from riots or arson. 

Keeping the people quiet was an important element of policy: the scale of the entertainments and the grain doles got bigger and bigger (the Coliseum was an imperial-era construction; most of the crazier stories about gladiatorial shows, such as the [Naumachia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naumachia) of Claudius and the antics of [Emperor Commodus](http://www.roman-empire.net/highpoint/commodus.html) come from imperial times). If the emperors didn't keep things quiet there was real danger: the [Nika riots](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/circusmaximus/nika.html) in Constantinople in the 6th c. are thought to have killed 30,000 people and destroyed half the city.

The analogy with modern sports is pretty shaky. In Rome the bread and the circuses were intimately connected: they were the two halves of the minimal contract between the government and its poorer citizens. In the modern world sports is just one of many forms of entertainment : they certainly count as a distraction but so does Quora.
