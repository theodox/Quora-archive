# Is Suetonius' Life of Augustus formally "anonymous", i.e. does the text say it was authored by Suetonius?

We’ve lost the first few pages of the _Vitae Caesarum._ Our editions today start from Caesar’s 16th birthday, so we’re missing the opening of Caesar, Suetonius’ introduction, and the dedication — which is where we’re expect to find his name. The Byzantine author [John Lydus](https://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/tag/john-the-lydian/), however, mentions the now-lost dedication (from Suetonius, using his cognomen Tranquillus) to Septicius Clarus, the praetorian prefect of the years 119–121.

It’s fairly rare for ancient historians to speak in the first person outside their own introductions and/or dedications. Given that many our our surviving texts lost that kind of supporting material we’re often reliant on late Roman or Byzantine editors to supply the kind of information for us. However by the time most of our surviving texts were copied (typically between the 8th and 11th century) it was standard practice to include the name of the author in a frontispiece, just as we do today.

See [Did Tacitus write the Annals? I've recently learned the text is anonymous. Does he name himself later in the Annals or is it just completely anonymous?](https://www.quora.com/Did-Tacitus-write-the-Annals-Ive-recently-learned-the-text-is-anonymous-Does-he-name-himself-later-in-the-Annals-or-is-it-just-completely-anonymous/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=b4a3ff91&srid=zLvM) for a bit more on the same subject.
