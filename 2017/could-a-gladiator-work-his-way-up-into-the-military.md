Generally you only became a gladiator in one of two ways: by being a condemned criminal, or by being a prisoner of war. A gladiator was a slave, so there was no option to volunteer. You could win your freedom by success in the arena, but the rules for that were not very consistent. In some periods winning five fights was enough to earn the wooden sword, the mark of a freed gladiator — but more commonly it was a decision entirely up to the owner.

In any case, as freed slave you were probably not an ideal recruit for the regular military. A new soldier had to pass a board of review, and a former condemned criminal would not be prime soldiering material — although the Romans were very pragmatic about that sort of thing, so it’s not impossible that a blind eye could be turned under the right circumstances. On the whole, though, gladiators occupied a very low social niche: they were famous, but distrusted — you can think of them almost like the gangster rappers of antiquity.

Still, in dire emergencies the Romans did incorporate gladiators into the army — Marcus Aurelius, for example, bought up a large number of gladiators and enrolled them in the legions during the crisis of the [Marcomannic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcomannic_Wars). On several occasions, individual politicians used gladiators as a private army; sometimes as bodyguards and sometimes as political thugs. The most famous example was the gladiators of [Titus Annius Milo ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Annius_Milo)who played in important role in the street fights between supporters of Caesar and supporters of Pompey. Under the empire that route closed down, since the emperors were averse to private armies in the hands of wealthy Romans.

Most retired gladiators ended up working in the gladiator business, as trainers or as umpires in the arena.
