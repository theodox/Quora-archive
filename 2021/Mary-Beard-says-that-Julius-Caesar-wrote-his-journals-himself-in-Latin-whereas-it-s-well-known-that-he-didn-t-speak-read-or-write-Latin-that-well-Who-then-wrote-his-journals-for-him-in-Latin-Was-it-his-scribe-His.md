# Mary Beard says that Julius Caesar wrote his journals himself in Latin, whereas, it’s well known that he didn’t speak, read or write Latin that well. Who, then, wrote his journals for him in Latin? Was it his scribe? His adjutant? His publicist?

Here’s what Cicero — widely regarded as the most important Latin stylist ever — [put into the mouths of one of his characters about Caesar](http://www.attalus.org/old/brutus1.html):

> But Caesar, who was guided by the principles of art, has corrected the imperfections of a vicious custom, by adopting the rules and improvements of a good one, as he found them occasionally displayed in the course of polite conversation. Accordingly, to the purest elegance of expression, (which is equally necessary to every well-bred citizen, as to an orator) he has added all the various ornaments of eloquence; so that he seems to exhibit the finest painting in the most advantageous point of view. As he has such extraordinary merit even in the common run of his language, I must confess that there is no person I know of, to whom he should yield the preference

To which another character replies:

> [Caesar’s writings] merit the highest approbation: for they are plain, correct, and graceful, and divested of all the ornaments of language, so as to appear (if I may be allowed the expression) in a kind of undress.... he has certainly prevented all sensible men from attempting any improvement on his plan.

The kicker is that the second speaker is Brutus. Yes, _that_ Brutus. And this was written in 46 BC!

So, If Caesar had a ghost writer he was a damn good one.

Moreover none of his many political enemies called him out for using a substitute. They did, however, note that Caesar’s lieutenant [Aulus Hirtius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Hirtius) was the real author of several parts of his account of the civil wars and the last book of the Gallic commentaries.

TLDR: the questions seems to be based on a misunderstanding.
