Latin was very widespread in North Africa.

Among the many famous Latin authors from Africa are [Terence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence), [Apuleius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apuleius), and [Marcus Cornelius Fronto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Cornelius_Fronto). For many centuries the most widely read book in Latin after the Bible was the [Confessions of St. Augustine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_(Augustine)), written in Annaba, Algeria by the Punic / Berber saint.

Latin remained the language of the most urban areas in North Africa well beyond the fall of the Roman Empire: the [African Romance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Romance) dialect was still the language of African Christians up to at least the 11th century and in some places as late as the 14th.
