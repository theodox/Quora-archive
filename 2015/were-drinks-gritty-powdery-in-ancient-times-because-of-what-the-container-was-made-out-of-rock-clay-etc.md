This is not exactly on topic, but Egyptians and Mesopotamians used clay straws to drink their beer. However this was to help avoid the barley grit floating in the unfiltered brew, not because of sediment in the cups. 

Lower class-containers would be similar to what we call [Terracotta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta). Nicer pieces would be glazed and smooth, just like modern stoneware:
