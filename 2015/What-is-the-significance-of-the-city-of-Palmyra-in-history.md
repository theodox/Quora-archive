Palmyra was an extremely wealthy city in its heyday, between 63 and 273 AD. It sat on the main overland route between the Roman world, Persia and India and benefitted hugely from the thriving trade along that route (more details on the rise and fall of the city [here](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Romans-attack-Palmyra))

 The site boasts a number of unique architectural an artistic treasures reflecting an unusual mixture of Mesopotamian, Semitic and Greco-Roman cultures: it gives a glimpse of how different traditions met and mingled. Plus, it has a genuine celebrity in form of [Zenobia](http://www.ancient.eu/zenobia/), the warrior-queen who led the city to its greatest heights -- and it's dramatic downfall.

The city was overthrown at the height of its prosperity. The trade routes on which it subsisted moved elsewhere and the population declined rapidly. That plus the remote desert location helped preserve the city very effectively, which it why it's such a stunning archeological site.
