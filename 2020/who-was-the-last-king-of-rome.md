It’s [Lucius Tarquinius Superbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus) — the legendarily arrogant Etruscan whose crimes so outraged the Roman public that he was driven out by in a civil war. He left such a bad memory that the Romans [refused to have another king — even half a millennium later, when Rome had become a monarchy in practices, the Romans still refused to use the title rex or “king” and hid their autocracy behind a series of euphemisms.](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Caesar-come-to-mean-emperor-Why-did-all-Roman-emperors-call-themselves-Caesar-of-Rome/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=fff5fa67&srid=zLvM)

There have been a variety of other kings who ruled Italy, in practice or in theory, since then, but generally the never used the title “king of Rome” or “king of the Romans” — typically it was “king of Italy”
