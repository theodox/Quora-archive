When Caesar’ troops marched into Rome to celebrate his triumph in Gaul, they sang

> Urbani, servate uxores: moechum calvom adducimus.
Aurum in Gallia effutuisti, hic sumpsisti mutuum.

> Cityfolk, take care of your wives — we’re bringing you a bald adulterer!
You [Caesar] screwed around in Gaul with the the gold you borrowed here!

The reference to “borrowed” gold was to a rumor that Caesar financed his career with gifts from his lady friends in Rome. Caesar cut a wide swathe among Roman society with numerous lovers, evidently of both sexes; one of his opponents called him “every woman's man and every man's woman." Outside of Rome, his lovers included of course Cleopatra but also queen [Eunoë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euno%C3%AB_(wife_of_Bogudes)) of Mauretania and — if we can believe his political enemies — king [Nicomedes of Bithynia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomedes_IV_of_Bithynia).

His longest standing romance was with with [Servilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servilia_(mother_of_Brutus)), the mother of Brutus, with whom he carried on an affair for decades. The ancient rumor mill hinted that Brutus might, in fact, have been Caesar’s son although this has never been more than a speculation.
