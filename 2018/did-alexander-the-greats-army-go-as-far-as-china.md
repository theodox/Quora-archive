No, they never really got far beyond the watershed of the Indus river. We don’t know exactly where they turned around, but it was short of the Ganges — it was probably on the [Beas River](https://www.dawn.com/news/1227122) in Punjab.

The Greek kingdoms of [Bactria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom), which arose out of the fragments of Alexander’s empire after his death, didn’t exactly “reach” China but they were an important part of the trading networks of Central Asia which would eventually become the famous Silk Road. The [Kushan Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushan_Empire) which succeeded them did have diplomatic and military ties with Han China, it’s probable that at least a few Greek-inscribed Kushan coins circulated in China. Greek sculptural traditions from Bactria played an important role in the evolution of Buddhist art, and many conventions from Bactria ended up being incorporated into Chinese Buddhist traditions.
