It was not invented by the Greeks or Romans -- it's pretty well documented that the Egyptians for example, required their priests to be shaved:

Mesopotamians seem generally to be have been more 'pro-hair' than than Egyptians, but many religious traditions in the Levant also involved shaving (you were, in fact, pretty lucky if that [that was all they cut off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atargatis) -- the cultic implications of going hairless are a subtext in the biblical story of Samson many modern readers miss).

In Greece shaving caught on with Alexander the Great, who shaved throughout his life and made it a very common fashion. However it is clear that earlier Greeks had sometimes shaved as well, as you can see from these Mycenaean frescoes from 500 years before Alexander:

The fashion in the classical era, however, was decidedly hairy; beardlessness was associated with youth and sexual availability; it was not the province of real men until Alexander made it popular.

_Alexander_ 

After around the 2d century BC beards were associated with serious thinkers and traditionalists, while the fashionable types tended to shave. Jokes about philosophers and their beards were a comedy staple.

The Romans seem to have picked up shaving from the Etruscans, as early as the 6th century BC. The story in Pliny that the first barber came to Rome in 454 AUC (= 299 BC) seems to be contradicted by pictorial evidence from Etruscan sites:

There's another story [Scipio Africanus ](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Scipio-Africanus-the-Elder) was the first Roman to shave his beard, but that's 60 years after the arrival of that theoretical first barber so one assumes business was very slow... or that the stories are hopelessly confused. Smooth chins were very common in the Republic up through the second century AD; beards became fashionable under Greco-phile emperors like Hadrian and also as a symbol of military credentials during the war-ridden years of the third century (somewhat like the way beards made a huge comeback in the US following the civil war).
