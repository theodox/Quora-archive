Ummm….. both the Greeks (in the person of Alexander the Great) and the Romans (starting with Julius Caesar) conquered Egypt. The Greeks also occupied the coastal parts of modern Libya as far west as modern Benghazi, starting in the 7th century BC. All of the one-time Greek holding ended up in Roman hands by around the first century, along with the fertile parts of North Africa from Libya to Morocco. Three Roman emperors were born in North Africa, along with a host of literary and political figures.

The Greek colony in Cyrene lasted for more than a thousand years; Greeks ruled over Egypt for almost three hundred years. Rome controlled the entire southern shore of the Mediterranean from Syria to Morocco for more than five centuries.
