Helen constantly accuses herself in the poem, wishing she had died rather than accompanying Paris and describing herself as a “bitch” (κυνὸς) which to ancient ears implied “prostitute” as well.

On the other hand the portrait of her is very nuanced and her self-reproach may not necessarily be a real confession. By the time of the poem she despises Paris, trying to avoid sleeping with him and wishing he’d go out and be killed by Menelaus once and for all; so her self-accusations may be more an index of her misery than of her complicity in the abduction. The actual events of a decade earlier are glossed over, so it’s not clear from the text.

In antiquity there were a few variant accounts, including several in which Helen was innocent and [one widely circulated one in which she wasn’t even involved](http://www.ancient-literature.com/greece_euripides_helen.html) — the Helen who went to Troy was just a magical phantom and the real Helen sat out the whole thing in Egypt. Herodotus’s history starts out with a [recap.](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1&force=y) He claims to be retelling the story as it’s told by the Persians, and in his version Paris deliberately set out to obtain a wife by capture. The Persians apparently feel that the Greeks over-reacted to a routine case of abduction, so all the subsequent centuries of fighting are really their fault — proof that internet-level “logic” long precedes the rise of Twitter.
