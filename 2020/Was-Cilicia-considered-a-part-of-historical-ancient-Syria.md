Not really.

Cilicia is really two very distinct regions. In the west is __Cilicia Trachaea__ , which is itself not exactly a region so much as series of micro-regions formed around a series of isolated bays on the seacoast. Each one is hard to reach by land and guarded by rocky headlands. which is why the area was a notorious pirates nest at several times in its history. To the extent Cilicia Trachea had much connection with the outside world at all, it was connected to Anatolia.

In the east is __Cilicia Pedias,__ or “flat Cilicia” — it’s much more approachable (and better suited for agriculture) and it did communicate with Syria overland. Cilicia Pedias was conquered by the Assyrians, which shows that it was reachable from the east. Nevertheless the area was quite distinct. The so-called “Syrian Gates” — todays’ [Belen Pass](https://www.livius.org/pictures/turkey/amanus/belen-pass/) — were the only really practical connection between Syria and Cilicia Pedias.

_This map gives a reasonably good view of the ancient borders, with the line between Syria and Cilicia along the Amanus (Nur) mountains_ 

Today’s Turkish-Syrian border is a bit stingy to ancient Syria; the “Syrian Gates” are 50km or so inside of Turkey. Traditionally Syria would have extended up to the Amanus mountains (the modern [Nur Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nur_Mountains)). Antioch was the most famous city of Greco-Roman Syria, but today it’s Antakya, Turkey.
