The real relationship was best described as “potential threat.”

Caesarion was Julius Caesar’s biological (though, by Roman law, illegitimate) son. Octavian was Caesar’s adopted son. Biologically, Octavian was Caesar’s grand-nephew.

Since Octavian’s position in Rome depended upon his role as the recognized heir of Caesar, Caesarion was a problem in the waiting. Even if Caesarion himself had no political ambitions, a living biological son of Julius Caesar would be a natural magnet for rivals who wanted to contest the leadership of the Caesarian faction — Octavian, whose career started in part because the Senatorial elite wanted to use _him_  as a figurehead to corral Caesar’s supporters, could not help but imagine the same scenario playing out again. The war between Octavian and Antony was, in large part, a war between rival ideas about Caesar’s legacy in the first place; having just put down one potential claimant to Caesar’s mantle, Octavian apparently dared not risk the emergence of another.
