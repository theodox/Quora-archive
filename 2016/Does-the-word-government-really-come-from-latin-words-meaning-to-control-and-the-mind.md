Not at all.

The English word gets to us by a 3-step translation from Greek to Latin to French. The Greek original is __κυβερνάω__ , “”kybernαο,” which was then Latinized as _gubernο_  and passed from Latin into French as _governer._ It originally just meant “steer”: long before Arnold came along _[gubernator](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=gubernator&la=la#lexicon)_ __ was Latin for “helmsman”. The more general use came along later as a metaphor.

The -_ment_  has nothing to do with _mens_ , it is just a way Latin and later French make an abstraction out of a verb, roughly equivalent to -ing in English: it produces non-telepathic words like _pigmentum,_ our “pigment” for “coloring” or _vestimentum,_ our “vestment” for “clothing”
