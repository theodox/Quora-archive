For me, it’s the so-called [Artemision Bronze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemision_Bronze).

Subjectively, I can’t forget the shock of walking into the national museum as a teenager and seeing that gigantic, godly face and those haunting hollow eyes.

The statue seems to me to be the precise moment of equipoise between the Archaic and the Classical styles - abstracted enough to be an intellectual as well as a sensual experience but brilliantly observed and executed as well.

I’m stubbornly attached to the “Poseidon hypothesis” — that it’s a votive statue of Poseidon, sunk deliberately as a thank-offering for the naval victory over the Persians at [Artemision](http://www.livius.org/articles/place/artemisium/) in 480 BC. That makes it a stirring bit of history in addition to a stunning piece of art.

I’ve always had a soft spot for this uncharacteristically whimsical little bit from grim, murderous Mycenae.

And this is not usually what people think of as “Byzantine Art”, but it’s from the Imperial Palace in Constantinople
