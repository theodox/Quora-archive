Two other vectors if you want Python on your phone.

http://omz-software.com/pythonista/ Is a sandboxed Python interpreter that runs on. iOS; it's not suitable for commercial app development but it can do all sorts of useful scripting tasks, and it can even do GUIs. 

https://github.com/bamboo/boo Is not exactly Python but it is syntactically very similar. It compiles to clr assemblies and can run on mono, so you can do app development using http://xamarin.com with boo. Because it undergoes static compilation it doesn't run afoul of Apples guidelines on dynamic languages or need a sandbox. Here's an article covering boo basics from a Python perspective: http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2015/05/boo-who.html?m=1
