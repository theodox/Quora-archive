Most archeologist identify the site of Troy with a site at [Hisarlik](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisarlik), in western Turkey. The general area has been associated with Troy at least since the time of Alexander the Great, who visited what was believed to be a “tomb of Achilles” there. The discoveries of [Heinrich Schliemann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Schliemann) there seem to fit roughly with the picture provided by Homer, but there’s plenty of debate about the details.
