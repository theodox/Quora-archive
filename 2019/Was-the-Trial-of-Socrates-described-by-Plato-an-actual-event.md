Yes, it’s historical.

Plato’s account is very literary, and does not agree in detail with the other surviving account (by [Xenophon](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0212), another contemporary). It would not be wise to assume that the words recorded by Plato are verbatim: they were written down well after the fact, and Plato was an accomplished playwright before he was a philosopher. So, it’s not a good idea to treat Plato’s version as if it were a trial transcript. However, there’s no doubt that Socrates was a historical figure and that he was tried and executed by the Athenians in 399 BC.
