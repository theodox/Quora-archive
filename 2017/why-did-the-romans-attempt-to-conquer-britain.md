They tried it twice.

The first invasion, under Julius Caesar, wasn’t really a full blown attempt at conquest. Caesar believed that the Britons were supporting his enemies in Gaul — at that period the peoples on both sides of the channel were culturally close and Caesar was anxious to minimize any outside force that could stir up trouble in his recently-conquered Gallic territories. Caesar set up a couple of local client kings to keep order, but after that he returned to the continent where more important matters — like his war against the Senate — were waiting.

The second invasion, under emperor Claudius, seems to have been a cheap propaganda ploy. Claudius was an unpopular emperor with a charisma deficit; a military victory was a good way to shore up his reputation. The Britons were not a regarded as a particularly frightening enemy and the Romans brought a fairly overwhelming force (including an armored elephant!) just to make sure things went smoothly. Certainly it was am easier triumph than, say, a major operation across the Rhine into Germany or a campaign against the Parthians.

In both instances, more cynical Romans felt the conquest of Britain was a waste of time and money — Britain was a backwater that wouldn’t repay the cost of conquest. But empire has its own logic.
