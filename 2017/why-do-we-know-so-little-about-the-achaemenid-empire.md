Unfortunately, it’s because there’s very little source material to work with.

Old Persian didn’t have a full-fledged written form. Darius I commissioned a cuneiform rendition of Persian for his royal proclamations, like the [Behistun Inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_Inscription), but it does not seem to have caught on as a popular medium of communication. [Persian administrative records](https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/projects/persepolis-fortification-archive) — the few we have — were a multilingual melange of Babylonian and Elamite cuneiform, Aramaic, and Greek.

Because Persian didn’t evolve a written literature for unofficial contexts, next to nothing of a historical or literary nature from this period has come down to us. There must have been something there; clearly traditions like the [Avesta](http://www.avesta.org/) — the Zoroastrian scriptures — don’t spring into existence out of nothingness. However the manuscript tradition for the Avesta is only a bit over one thousand years old. For the Achaemenids, more than a millennium earlier, there’s basically nothing but table scraps: a handful of inscriptions, coins, and administrative texts revealed by archeology. Sometimes these are historically valuable — for example, there’s a [Babylonian astronomy tablet that throws an interesting light the climactic battle at Gaugamela](http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/bchp-alexander/astronomical_diary-330_03.html) — but they are very sparse.

It’s pretty telling that later Persian sources are extremely hazy on the Achaemenid period — even the Sassanids, who claimed to be the inheritors of the Achaemenids, don’t actually seem to know much about them in the sources that come down to us. They Achaemenids were collapsed in to legend in Sassanid texts: the founder of the Sassanian line, for example, is supposed to be a descendant of “Dara” — ie, of Darius — but Dara is the last of a legendary line of “[Kayanid](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iran-iii-traditional-history)” kings descended from someone named Lohrāsp , not the familiar member of the court we know from Greek sources.

It’s worth pointing out in passing that we don’t have sources _in Persian_ , but there’s a lot of “Persian” literature written by Persian _subjects_ : from Herodotus (born a Persian subject in Halicarnassus) to the Book of Esther in the Bible to Egyptian texts there is a lot of first hand material from people who lived under Persian rule. Unfortunately for the student of Persian history, though, these texts reflect local, rather than Persian perspectives — we’re in the position of trying to reconstruct the history of the British Empire using exclusively sources in Hindi, Urdu and Arabic.

> _This Babylonian tablet mentions the battle of Gaugamela:_ On the morning of the twenty-fourth of the month of Ulûlu, the king of the world [Alexander] raised his standard [_lacuna_ ]. The armies engaged each other and the king’s soldiers suffered a heavy defeat. The troops abandoned their king [Darius] and headed back to their cities. They fled to the lands in the east.note
