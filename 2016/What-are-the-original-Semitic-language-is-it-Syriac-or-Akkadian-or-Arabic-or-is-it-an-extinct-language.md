We can't be sure because the divisions of the Semitic language family are older than writing. So what we have is primarily reconstructions based on language features and sound shifts.

There are three big families of Semitic languages. Akkadian and a few other Mesopotamian languages — all now extinct — come from the eastern branch, which has no living descendants. Hebrew and Arabic as well as Aramaic and Syriac come from the central group which is centered in the levant and Arabia. The Ethiopian languages come from the southern family around the mouth of the Red Sea.

We don't have much evidence for the spread of these languages before the invention of writing. Different scholars have proposed different original homelands for the parent “Proto-Semitic” language , but I'm not qualified to pick one of them. I think the two main contenders are either a Syrian / Levantine origin or an Ethipian one — the population density of Arabia 6000 years ago was probably not high enough to spread a language so widely .

We do know that Sumerian is not s Semitic language, though we don't know any other languages, living or dead, which resemble it. A lot of Sumerian words did carry over into Akkadian as legal or religious terminology since Akkadian was written with cuneiform characters.
