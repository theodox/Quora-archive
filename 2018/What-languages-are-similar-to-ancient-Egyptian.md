[Coptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language) is the lineal descendant of ancient Egyptian â€” it was knowledge of Coptic which allowed scholars to decode hieroglyphics, [once a few sound values were established by the finding of bilingual inscriptions in Greek and Egyptian](https://www.quora.com/How-were-the-Hieroglyphics-deciphered). Coptic was still a living language in Egypt as late as the 16th century, but now it survives primarily as a liturgical language. You can, however, [learn Coptic online ](http://www.copticplace.com/coptic_languge/coptic.html)and get a more or less direct link to the language of the Pharoahs.

Because written records for other languages of the region are pretty scanty, the historical relationship of ancient Egyptian to other nearby ancient languages is pretty unclear. Unlike European languages, whose family tree is fairly well understood, the relationships within the [Afroasiatic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages) family are still much debated. Egyptian has been tentatively linked to the [Semitic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_languages) , the family which includes Arabic and Hebrew; to the [Cushitic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushitic_languages), which include modern Somali; and to the [Chadic languages ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadic_languages)of central Africa.
