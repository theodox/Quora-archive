Alexander’s mother, [Olympias](https://www.ancient.eu/Olympias/), was… well, “remarkable” doesn’t quite cover it. Depending on how you look at it she was a fierce mother-lion protecting her pride, a vengeful harpy from a barbarous and brutal tribal background, a crazed religious zealot, or an uncompromising strong woman in a patriarchal milieu.*

The available evidence, unfortunately, leaves a lot of room for interpretation — [particularly because the eventual winners in the generation-long struggle to control Alexander’s legacy ](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-the-descendants-of-Alexander-the-Great/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=01040a68&srid=zLvM)all shared one common interest: they all had to make it clear that Alexander might be the spiritual founder of their kingdoms, but his family was _gone._ Generosity to the defeated was not part of the agenda for several generations. So — bear in mind that the story we know is heavily influenced by the desire of several different factions to make both Olympias and her primary rivals all look bad.

That said, here’s the outline of her later career:

__330–319: Off the board__ 

Alexander’s relationship with his mother was pretty strained during his reign. While she was, by all accounts, fiercely devoted to him she was also a forceful, domineering woman in a world where forceful women were not prized. While he was away campaigning in the east, she battled incessantly with his regent, [Antipater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipater). She also sent Alexander a steady stream of letters, complaining about her treatment at home and offering him unsolicited advice. Eventually she left Macedon altogether: in 330 BC she returned to Epirus where she acted as regent for a young cousin and licked her wounds.

Thus, when Alexander died in 323 she was a marginal figure in Macedonian politics. In the chaos that followed, however, her powerful temperament pushed her back to the fore. Isolated in Epirus, she was a world away from her infant grandson [Alexander IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_IV_of_Macedon) and Alexander’s wife [Roxana. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxana)Whatever her other qualities, all the ancient sources are unanimous that Olympias was singlemindedly devoted to the wellbeing of her grandson, and she threw herself into the struggle over Alexander’s legacy with abandon.

Perdiccas, the general who cobbled together a shaky new government after Alexander’s death, was well aware of the shakiness of his position. He was nominally only the regent for the infant Alexander IV and Alexander’s mentally impaired brother [Arrhidaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_III_of_Macedon)** — they were the nominal co-rulers of the empire, but Perdiccas held the reigns of government. However he was neither popular nor particularly respected; even before Alexander’s burial he faced the first of many mutinies.

So, Perdiccas proposed marriage to the daughter of Antipater, the most powerful man back home in Macedon, but also the determined enemy of Olympias.

__319: Queen’s gambit__ 

Olympias was still out of the country, but she was well informed of the intrigues surrounding her grandson. She would not entrust the child to Antipater — she believed (or at least, affected in public to believe) that it was Antipater’s son, [Iollas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iollas) , who was really [responsible for Alexander’s death.](https://www.quora.com/Was-Aristotle-responsible-for-the-death-of-Alexander-the-Great-given-that-Aristotle-was-furious-with-Alexander-for-killing-Callisthenes-Aristotles-nephew/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=1a58753d&srid=zLvM) Olympias could not let Antipater get so close to her grandson. So, she countered by offering Perdiccas a more tempting prize: her daughter [Cleopatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_of_Macedon). As Alexander’s sister and the former queen of Epirus, Cleopatra was a valuable political asset.

Perdiccas abandoned Antipater, triggering [the first of the generation-long series of wars which would tear Alexander’s empire apart.](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/diadochi/diadochi-2-the-first-diadoch-war/) Perdiccas was killed by his own troops in 319, leaving Antipater as the most powerful of the faction leaders.

However Antipater was old and declining — he died within a year. Antipater’s son, the able and efficient [Cassander](https://www.ancient.eu/Cassander/), seemed the logical choice as the next regent. However he had always hated Alexander and his father seems to have known that the infant heir would be endangered under Cassander’s control. He chose instead a reliable but unenterprising general, [Polyperchon](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/polyperchon/), as the next regent. Cassander, furious, allied himself with two more of Alexander’s generals and attacked Polyperchon. For the next two years, [two coalitions fought for control over the Macedonian world](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/diadochi/diadochi-3-the-second-diadoch-war-west/) — on one side the legitimists who followed Polyperchon as the voice of the two nominal “kings”, Alexander IV and Arrhidhaeus, and on the other Cassander and the most powerful of the warlords who were cannibalizing Alexander’s empire.

There were also tensions within the legitimist camp. The nominal king, Arrhidaeus, was a nonentity but his wife [Adea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurydice_II_of_Macedon) was a remarkable young woman. Not unlike Olympias, Adea hailed from the wild fringes of the Greek world — her mother [Cynane](https://www.ancient.eu/Cynane/) was Alexander’s half-sister, the child of an Illyrian princess who taught her to hunt and fight. The Macedonian soldiery admired her pluck as well as her royal blood. For Olympias, however, Adea was a threat to her grandson — and, perhaps almost as bad, a bitter reminder of her own estrangement from Philip and his other wives.

__317: Black Queen / White Queen__ 

The war between Polyperchon and Cassander turned against the legitimists. It looked as if the dynasty would end up in the power of a man who nursed a lifelong grievance against Alexander. So, Olympias reacted with characteristic resolve. She raised an army of her own in Epirus to protect her grandson and her daughter in law Roxane… but _not_ the interests of the other royals, Adea and Arrhidaeus.

The astute teenage queen Adea saw what that portended, and fled with her husband to Cassander who was happy to use this branch of the royal family to legitimize his own plans.

Olympias led her army into Macedon while Cassander was trying to stamp out resistance in southern Greece. Adea raised an defense force on her own initiative — but on the field her soldiers refused to fight against Alexander’s mother and son. Olympias was back in Macedon for the first time in over a decade, at the head of her victorious army.

Here is where she earned the blackest part of her dubious reputation. Although she had promised not to harm Arrhidaeus and Adea, she swiftly had them murdered; no Macedonian would do the deed, so she used Thracian mercenaries who had no reverence for the heirs of Philip. She organized a vicious purge of Cassander’s supporters and relations. She even destroyed the tomb of Iollas and scattered his bones: to Greek eyes, the most awful sacrilege imaginable.

Her victory, however, was fleeting.

Cassander reappeared with his flanks secured and reinforcments from friendly warlords in the east. Her half-trained army was herded into the city of Pydna, hampered by the presence of a large but militarily useless “court” around the royal child. Her ineffectual colleague, Polyperchon, was unable to break the siege — in a sign of where Macedonian affairs were heading, much of his army was simply bribed to switch sides. The Macedonian nobility, too, defected once the weakness of the Queen’s position became clear; the purges of the previous year had also rendered her odious to many of the uncommitted.

Hemmed in by land and sea, the siege quickly grew desperate. Her precious elephants, a critical symbol of royal prestige as well as military assets, wasted away on a diet of sawdust and stubble until at last they were eaten. But it wasn’t just the elephants; soon people in the besieged city were eating corpses.

__316: Checkmate__ 

After several months of misery, Olympias was forced to surrender.

Cassander did not have a chivalrous bone in his body, and (as earlier and later events would show) he never let scruples stand in his way. However he faced a serious political problem: even defeated and bloodied Olympias was still the mother of Alexander, the wife of Philip, and the guardian of Alexander’s heir.

At first he tried to usher her off the scene with a pretended escape plot: if she absented herself voluntarily his hands would be clean but he, of course, would still have the all-important heir in his possession. But she refused to leave the child. So he reverted to type and dispatched a company of soldiers to cut her down. However when they broke into her residence and confronted that remarkable woman they were cowed: no man in Cassander’s squad of assassins dared to strike down the mother of the divine Alexander.

However Cassander’s dilemma was solved for him. Olympias’s purges (and her famous temper) had left her with many private enemies. So he arranged a public trial for her, packed with the friends and relatives of her victims.***

> Cassander, on summoning the people to an assembly, to inquire "what they would wish to be done with Olympias," induced the parents of those whom she had killed to put on mourning apparel, and expose her cruelties; when the Macedonians, exasperated by their statements, decreed, without regard to her former majesty, that she should be put to death ; utterly unmindful that, by the labours of her son and her husband, they had not only lived in security among their neighbours, but had attained to vast power, and even to the conquest of the world. Olympias, seeing armed men advancing towards her, bent upon her destruction, went voluntarily to meet them, dressed in her regal apparel, and leaning on two of her maids. The executioners, on beholding her, struck with the recollection of her former royal dignity, and with the names of so many of their kings, that occurred to their memory in connection with her, stood still, until others were sent by Cassander to despatch her; she, at the same time, not shrinking from the sword or the blow, or crying out like a woman, but submitting to death like the bravest of men, and suitably to the glory of her ancient race, so that you might have perceived the soul of Alexander in his dying mother.

> As she was expiring, too, she is said to have settled her hair, and to have covered her feet with her robe, that nothing unseemly might appear about her.

[Justinus, 14.6](http://www.attalus.org/translate/justin1.html#14.6)

Olympias’s end was a grim metaphor for the spiral of vendetta which was tearing Alexander’s short-lived empire apart. Treachery, faithlessness, and murder were the common currency of the next generation as the remaining warlords fought over the corpse of the Macedonian world. Cassander would go on to murder Alexander’s son and Roxana a few years later. When the feckless Polyperchon produced another possible heir, [Heracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles_of_Macedon), Cassander simply bribed him to have the boy murdered as well. One of Cassander’s sons would depose his brother and murder his mother; the ousted son called in a rival warlord to help him regain the throne, but decided that he was too dangerous and tried to assassinate him. Having failed, he was himself murdered by his intended victim, who eventually took the throne for himself, only for the kingdom to be dismembered by his own dubious allies.

As striking as Olympias’s turbulent last years seem to us, they were just business as usual in the brutal world created by Alexander’s death.



_*as a sad aside, it’s hard to find a good biography — typically one has to fall back on biographies of Alexander. It may actually be that the most influential portrait of her isn’t historical, it’s the character in_ _[Mary Renault’s series of Alexander novels](https://amzn.to/34yFcX7)_ _. Influential is of course not the same thing as “definitive” — but Renault was very familiar with the sources and retails most of the known stories effectively.
** Rumor had it that Olympias caused Arrhidaeus’ disability by an attempted poisoning (or in some variants, by witchcraft).
*** There are a number of internet references which claim that Olympias was stoned to death by the families of her victims. However there’s no ancient source which tells that story; the version given above and and shorter version by Diodorus Siculus don’t mention stoning, and Justinus clearly references swords._
