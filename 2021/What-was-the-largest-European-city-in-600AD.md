In 600 it’d have to be Constantinople, today’s Istanbul. Rome held the title until the early 400s — the political collapse of the western Roman empire (particularly, the loss of the fertile grain lands of North Africa) made the city’s size unsustainable.

In 600 Constantinople was smaller than Rome’s peak: the high estimate is between 500–600,000 compared to Rome’s 2d century high of more than a million. However by that time Rome’s population had plummeted to well under 100,000 — the city had been sacked several times (410, 455, 546, and 550), most the aqueducts had been cut during the war between the empire and the Ostrogoths, and a generation of warfare in the mid-sixth century had decimated Italian agriculture. Constantinople, on the other hand, was still the capital of the functioning and eastern Empire; it controlled territory as far as Spain and North Africa and most importantly it could still count on the massive grain surplus of Egypt.

600 was near a peak for Constantinople: A Persian army would besiege the city in 626 as part of a generation-long war. Just after a hard-fought and narrow victory the exhausted Romans would be confronted by the rise of the Arab Caliphate, which would besiege the city in 674 and again in 717. The loss of Egypt to the Arabs put a cap on the city’s population growth and began a long, slow decline into the middle Ages; however Constantinople remained the largest city in Europe until it was overtake by Paris, probably sometime in the 14th century.
