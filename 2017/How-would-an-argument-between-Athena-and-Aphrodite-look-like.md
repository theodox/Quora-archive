Here’s how the Greco-Egyptian poet [Colluthus ](http://www.theoi.com/Text/Colluthus.html)put it in his version of the [Judgement of Paris ](http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/JudgementParis.html):

Athena thinks Aphrodite is a girly-girl, who doesn’t care about important things like politics and war:

> Paris bent a gentle eye and quietly essayed to judge the beauty of each. He looked at the light of their grey eyes, he looked on the neck arrayed with gold, he marked the bravery of each; the shape of the heel behind, yea and the soles of their feet. But, before he gave judgement, Athena took him, smiling, by the hand and spake to Alexander [=Paris] thus: “Come hither, son of Priam! leave the spouse of Zeus and heed not Aphrodite, queen of the bridal bower, but praise thou Athena who aids the prowess of men. They say that thou art a king and keepest the city of Troy. Come hither, and I will make thee the saviour of their city to men hard pressed: lest ever Enyo of grievous wrath weigh heavily upon thee. Hearken to me and I will teach thee war and prowess.”

Aphrodite thinks Athena is cold and arrogant and inhuman:

> … And [Aphrodite], holding the apple in her hand, uttered her voice and spake in mockery of Hera and manly Athena: "Yield to me, accustomed as ye be to war, yield me the victory. Beauty have I loved and beauty follows me. They say that thou, mother of Ares, didst with travail bear the holy choir of the fair-tressed Graces. But to-day they have all denied thee and not one hast thou found to help thee. Queen but not of shields and nurse but not of fire, Ares hath not helped thee, though Ares rages with the spear: the flames of Hephaestus have not helped thee, though he brings to birth the breath of fire. And how vain is thy vaunting, [Athena], whom marriage sowed not nor mother bare, but cleaving of iron and root of iron made thee spring without bed of birth from the head of thy sire. And how, covering thy body in brazen robes, thou dost flee from love and pursuest the works of Ares, untaught of harmony and knowing not of concord. Knowest thou not that such Athenas as thou are the more unvaliant -- exulting in glorious wars, with limbs at feuds, neither men nor women?”

Paris (far right) choosing between Hera (far left), Athena, and Aprodite. Or in a more modern version
