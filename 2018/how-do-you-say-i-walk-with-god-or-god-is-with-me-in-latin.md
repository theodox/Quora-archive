_deus mecum_ is the short-form version of “God is with me”. The old Latin mass used _deus tecum_  for “[may] God [be] with you” — in both cases the verbs are skipped for brevity.

_cum deo ambulo_  is a nice way to say “I walk with God”, since _ambio_ is a kind of low-grade pun on _ambo,_ the Latin for “both” or “a pair”.
