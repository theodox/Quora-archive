# Should I spend the time reading Diogenes Laertius' "Lives of Eminent philosophers" if I want a thorough understanding of ancient Greek philosophy, or would the book be too prolix to read entirely?

It really depends what you want.

Diogenes is a biographer, not an academic philosopher. If you want interesting anecdotes about Greek thinkers, or if you want to get an atmospheric appreciation of the social setting of Greek philosophy, Diogenes has a lot of fascinating nuggets.

On the other hand, if you want to get at the subtleties of the actual philosophical positions he covers, you probably want to start with modern secondary sources instead. Diogenes is not always a very critical reader of his own sources; he’s more inclined to show off how many references he can collect than to provide a solidly reasoned argument about which reading is correct. Often he reads like undergraduate note-taking : you can see him jotting down what’s practically a bullet-point outline of main heads in the authors he reads but he doesn’t always have much insight into how things add up.
