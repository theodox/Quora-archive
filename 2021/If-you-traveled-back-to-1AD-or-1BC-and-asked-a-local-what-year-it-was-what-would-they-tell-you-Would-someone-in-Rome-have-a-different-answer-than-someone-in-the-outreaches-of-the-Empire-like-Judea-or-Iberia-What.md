# If you traveled back to 1AD or 1BC and asked a local what year it was, what would they tell you? Would someone in Rome have a different answer than someone in the outreaches of the Empire (like Judea or Iberia?) What about other parts of the world?

This is covered at length here:



The TLDR is that there was no widely used serial dating system in Roman empire. In the eastern provinces a lot of people used [a system dating back to the origin of the (already defunct) Seleucid empire in our 311 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_era). That’s the one used by, for example, the Book of Maccabees — although, not being fans of the Seleucids, the authors simply said things like “the year 137” without supplying the source: you can think of it as an ancient version of using “CE” for “AD”

The Roman government used the names of the consuls as a reference : a Roman official in our 1 CE would have told you it was the consulate of Caius Caesar and L. Aemillius Paulus. Most parts of the empire had local calendars that worked similarly — and most of them were pretty wonky and didn’t line up reliably.
