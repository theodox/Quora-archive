The Punic name of Carthage was QRT ḤDŠT ( __𐤒𐤓𐤕 𐤇𐤃𐤔𐤕__ ).

Unfortunately for us Punic does not record vowels — we typically write this as _Qart Hadasht_  but the vowels are guesses, in this case guessed based on the fact that the Romans wrote it as Carthago or Karthago. We don’t know for sure what it would have sounded like when spoken by a native.

Since Punic has no living speakers and no linguistic descendants — and a couple of consonants (Ḥ and Š) that are hard for most speakers of Indo-European languages like English — using a reconstructed pronunciation of __𐤒𐤓𐤕 𐤇𐤃𐤔𐤕__ does not add much value. In fact, it adds some confusion: QRT ḤDŠT simply means “new city” and and there are actually several of them in the Punic world — most notably the city in Iberia which the Romans called _Carthago Nova_  and the Spanish today know as _Cartagena._

If you want to retire an exonym “Phoenicia” is just a Latinization of the Greek word for “where the purple comes from.” But the Phoenicians (and their Punic descendants) called themselves _Kenaʿani_ or _[Chanani](https://www.quora.com/Did-Saint-Augustine-speak-Berber/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=225507244&share=8e718571&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer)_ _._ This is, of course, familiar as _Canaanites_  but again, using that in preference to Phoenicians may invoke more confusion than it resolves.
