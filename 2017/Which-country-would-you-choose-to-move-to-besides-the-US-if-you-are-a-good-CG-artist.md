Canada is not a bad choice, since it has a [pretty lavish subsidy regime for film and vfx production](http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/blame-canada-u-s-visual-effects-artists-want-reforms-under-nafta-1.3487616). Quebec in particular offers aggressive tax breaks and other perks for VFX, film and game production — there’s a reason a huge chunk of the the French games industry essentially moved to Montreal!. On the other hand Vancouver, which had a similar program, [cut its subsidies](http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2016/05/bc-film-tax-credits-changes/) and the local industry had a pretty severe crash. Politics come and politics go, so if your studio is only sustainable with subsidies it can be nerve wracking.

Canadian CG salaries are good by world standards but significantly lower than in the US. A lot depends on where in Canada: the cost of living in, say, Toronto is l less than LA but the Vancouver area is comparable to west coast centers like LA and SF while Vancouver wages lag. OTOH US Salaries tend to look unduly impressive because the industry is centered in high-cost-of-living areas on the west coast.

In Europe, the “euro gradient” generally applies: the northern and western Europe will have more work and higher salaries than southern and eastern Europe. France used to have a very big footprint in CG but their industry has struggled to maintain its lead since the end of the 90’s; a lot of French CG artists ended up in Quebec or in the global VFX diaspora. Eastern Europe has seen a lot of growth — but a lot of that is driven by lower wages and production costs, so you’d have to worry about being stuck in lower-profile work.
