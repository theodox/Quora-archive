It’s not that surprising in context.

__Persian alliances__ 

The Spartans and the Persians were old buddies. Cyrus, after all, was one of the architects of the Persian-Spartan alliance which won the Peloponnessian war — the revenues which financed Lysander’s fleets at Notium and Aegospotami came mostly from Cyrus’s holdings in Asia Minor.

After the end of the war the Spartans did briefly wrap themselves in the mantle of pan-Hellenic opposition to Persia, but it was a short-lived and half-hearted effort. [Agesilaus II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agesilaus_II) fought the Persians in Asia Minor from 396 to 394 —but it’s hard to tell how much energy went into protecting the Asian Greeks and how much went into undermining the power of Persian favorite Lysander. The campaign definitely lacked the flavor of a zealous Hellenic crusade, and folded quickly with the outbreak of the [Corinthian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_War) back in Greece.

That war was a messy furball, but its final result was to resurrect the Spartan-Persian alliance. The [Peace of Antalcidas ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Antalcidas)in 387 — better, and quite accurately known as “the King’s Peace” — was little more than the Spartans signing on as Persia’s enforcers within Greece in return for money and political support (and the complete abandonment of the Ionian Greeks to Persian control).

The Persian alliance frayed when the Thebans temporarily dethroned the Spartans as the hegemonic power in Greece. The Persians began to support Thebes, earning Spartan ire. However Sparta was terribly weakened by the Theban victory at [Leuctra ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leuctra)and the bloody draw at [Mantinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mantinea_(362_BC)). In the 360’s the Spartans struck back as best they could in their weakened circumstances — though once again, it was by backing one Persian faction against another. During the the [Great Satraps' Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Satraps%27_Revolt) in Asia Minor, Sparta cooperated with the rebel satrap Ariobarzanes and the Egyptians, who had briefly expelled their Persian garrisons. However their intervention was far from decisive.

__Sparta and Macedon__ 

Meanwhile a new problem was confronting the Spartans closer to home: Macedon. The [Third Sacred War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Sacred_War), sucked in most Greek states, with Macedonia and Thebes forming the core of one side while Athens and Sparta helmed the other. That conflict dragged on for a decade (356–346) and ended with Philip in a dominating position. The next decade and a half were a scramble to contain Macedonia, but Sparta was licking its wounds and contributed nothing to the struggle.

Philip crushed the Athenians and Thebans at [Chaeronea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chaeronea_(338_BC)) in 338, making himself the master of Greece in all but name. He offered to let the Spartans join his “alliance”, the so-called [League of Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Corinth) but with more pride than pragmatism they refused. He didn’t bother to destroy the city but he did peel off several outlying territories, which he distributed to Sparta’s local rivals — guaranteeing that the rest of the Peloponessus would be pro-Spartan and anti-Macedonian.

Against that background, it’s no wonder that the Spartans had no love lost for Philip or Alexander. They’d been humiliated and impoverished and had no illusions about the purity of Macedonian intentions.

It was more or less inevitable, given previous Spartan-Persian alliances, that the Spartans would reach out to the Persians once Alexander had firmly committed his forces on the other side of the Aegean. Unfortunately for Sparta, they were overtaken by events: Persian ships and money were just beginning to arrive when Alexander won the day at the [Issus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Issus) in 333. Unable to affect the campaign in Asia, Agis III converted what he could of the Persian subsidies into an effort to retrieve lost territories back home — an effort that ended disastrously at [Megalopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Megalopolis) in 331, where the ancient Spartiate class fought its last great battle and was broken. Perhaps a quarter of the Spartan _homoioi_  were lost on that day, the worst single-day loss in Spartan history.

Alexander declined to destroy the defeated Spartans but Megalopolis marked the effective end of the ancient Lycurgan system. Within a couple of generations, Sparta’s famous way of life was a memory. The city itself would never be more than a regional power in the future.
