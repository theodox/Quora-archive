This mosaic is about done about 200 years after Alexander’s death — it’s believed to be a copy of an original from shortly after Alexander’s time.

This head is thought to be a Roman era copy of a statue [commissioned by Alexander himself](http://www.livius.org/articles/objects/azara-herm/):

It’s believed to be the one referenced in this description by [Plutarch](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/3.html) (about 300 years after Alexander’s death)

> 4 1 The outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which Lysippus made, and it was by this artist alone that Alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modelled. For those peculiarities which many of his successors and friends afterwards tried to imitate, namely, the poise of the neck, which was bent slightly to the left, and the melting glance of his eyes, this artist has accurately observed. Apelles, however, in painting him as wielder of the thunder-bolt, did not reproduce his complexion, but made it too dark and swarthy. Whereas he was of a fair colour, as they say, and his fairness passed into ruddiness on his breast particularly, and in his face

In [Aelian](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/aelian/varhist12.xhtml), Alexander’s hair color is described as _xanthos_ , which is not exactly blond but “lion colored”. [Callisthenes ](http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander1b.html)says that one of his eyes was blue and the other dark — but the text of Callisthenes has a lot of later, unreliable intrusions, so it’s not clear how much you want to rely on that. Some scholars believe that the right hand figure in[ this mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_Hunt_Mosaic) is Alexander:

The most widely circulated contemporary images of Alexander are coins.The horns over the ears are [a political statement](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised), but the nose, brow and chin are recognizable in the first mosaic and the statue above and maybe the second mosaic.

As to whether all that adds up to ‘Latino’, you can judge.
