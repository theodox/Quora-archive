Hmmm. This is a tough one.

Thinking of the western world, I’d say that there’s a few things we can guess based on other things we’ve found.

__More likely Greek than Latin,__  because…

__The highest likelihood of new findings is in Egypt__ . 

The [Oxyrhynchus papyri](http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/papyri/the_papyri.html) are the most fertile source of recovered texts , thanks to Egypt’s dry climate. As the largest source of written material, their contents give us some idea what to expect. Which means…

__A lot of classical Athenian literature__ . 

Atticism — the obsession with Athenian style between, say, Aeschylus and Aristotle — was a marked feature of Greco-Egyptiaan literary taste. So if we found something substantial, there’s a high likelihood it’s from somebody we already know, particularly somebody whose prestige was very high with the Athens-obsessed upper classes of Alexandria. But…

__It could also be a variant text of the Bible.__ 

Egypt was one of the first parts of the Roman world to embrace Christianity. So the desert has also been a fertile ground for religious history, producing many variants (usually subtle, but sometimes radical) of familiar texts. When it comes to survival, later is better — so in that sense at least sixth century theological tome has an advantage over, say, a first-century copy of Epicurus. Nonetheless…

__It’ll probably be a small fragment.__ 
While the Egyptian climate is fairly friendly to papyrus, we’re still talking about what’s basically a piece of paper surviving in the ground for two thousand years or so. That’s long time for paper. 

Since whatever we do find is very, very likely to be a fragment, we’ll probably expend a lot of ink deciding what it actually is. Back in the 90’s we found what _looks_ like a chunk of one of Aeschylus’ lost _[Achilles Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilleis_(trilogy))_  used as part of an Egyptian mummy wrapping — but it’s hard to be certain, since we’re rarely lucky enough to find something like a book title (we do, however, often find footnotes: one thing that the Alexandrians really loved was critical editions with commentaries on their favorite authors). Whatever we dig up will be a gold mine for the lucky academic who can make a strong case to identify it. In any event…

__It’s unlikely to have super secrets.__ 

The loss of books is a numbers game;_nothing is more important for survival than popularity._  So we’re probably going to find more from authors we know rather than things which even in antiquity were considered obscure. So we’ll probably find lots of comedies (one of the biggest winners in the papyrus sweepstakes is [Menander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menander), the inventor of the sitcom. It would be fascinating to find, say, the lost works of [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus), who coined the word “atom” — but in antiquity as now, weighty philosophical and scientific tomes did not dominate bookshelves. 

Most books that really shaped people’s thinking to a significant degree back then were unlikely to be lost altogether: they were copied and recopied and quoted and debated. It’s certainly possible we’ll find something that makes other things we already know fit together in a new way — a missing piece of context that throws a different light on what we already have. 

It’s less likely that there’s some unheard-of revelation buried away that we have no inkling of today. We know a lot of outline information about the 90+% of ancient works that are gone because the remaining ones reflect centuries of debate, commentary, and quotations from the missing ones. It’s fairly unlikely that none of the readers and writers who did survive completely failed to notice some great revelation that hasn’t left any trace in what we do have. 

It’s kind of like looking in your parents’ attic: you may find things that throw a new light on things you already know, but not too likely you’ll stumble across a photo of your mom on a date with Elvis: you’d probably have heard by now.

Until recently there was an [awesome online project](http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/Ancient_Lives/) that allowed volunteers to help categorize un-catalogued papyri. It seems to be on pause now, which is a shame, but if you check out the link you can get a sense both of what kinds of things are still being found and also what state the material is usually in. Here’s a particularly recent find, a new variant of the [myth of narcissus](http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/papyri/4711.html):
