The security for the British royal family was amazingly lax until the late 19th century. There were 7 different attempts on Queen Victoria's life:

The official life of 18th century Versailles was a carefully cultivated hothouse with unbelievably elaborate rules of precedence and protocol. However on the logistical side it was very open, both because of the huge numbers of service people who cycled in and out every day and also because of traditions, some dating back to the middle ages, which dictated that the royal family deal directly with some privileged groups of commoners. Moreover the size of the place and the huge volume of visitors made it more like a Worlds Fair ground than a private residence. Here's an English visitor in 1787:



> “Again to Versailles. In viewing the king’s apartment, which he had not left a quarter of an hour, with those slight traits of disorder that showed he lived in it, it was amusing to see the blackguard [dodgy] figures that were walking uncontrolled about the palace, and even in his bedchamber; men whose rags betrayed them to be in the last stage of poverty. Was I was the only person that stared and wondered how the devil they got there?
It is impossible not to like this careless indifference and freedom from suspicion. One loves the master of the house who would not be hurt or offended at seeing his apartment thus occupied if he returned suddenly, for if there was danger of this, the intrusion would be prevented. This is certainly a feature of that good temper which appears to me so visible everywhere in France.

You could also rent a hat and a sword outside the gate, which made gave you access to all of the public rooms and gardens!

During the late stages of the French Revolution, the intimate knowledge that many commoners had of the infrastructure of Versaille helped lead to the capture of the King: [Women's March on Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_March_on_Versailles)
