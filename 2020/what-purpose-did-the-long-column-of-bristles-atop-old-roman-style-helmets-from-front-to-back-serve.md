# What purpose did the long column of bristles atop old Roman-style helmets from front to back serve?

Crests generally have two functions.

To some degree they help with identification on the battlefield — you’ll note that typically Roman helmets are crested for centurions but not for ordinary infantrymen.

The crest makes it easier to pick out a small-unit group leader in the melee. Note how easy it is to identify the centurions here:

_This section of the column of Marcus Aurelius shows ordinary infantry with crests (notes that they are small brushes, not the stereotypical fore-and-aft shape). But this is not a battle scene, it’s a review (the emperor and his officers are on a stand at top right). Elsewhere on the same monument campaign scenes show uncrested soldiers.

Ordinary soldiers could also wear crests but typically they don’t seem to have done so in service - only on formal occasions. These crests may not have been the familiar ‘shoebrush’ shape — there’s examples showing small brush-like crests for ordinary infantry. These may have been colored for unit identification or just for display.

The primary outlier appears to have been the Praetorian Guard — the emperor’s personal security force, which spent a lot more time in the city of Rome than on the battlefield.

The Praetorian crests are fore-and-aft, and unlike the practical battlefield versions it does not seem to include a breakable spacer between the crest and the helm. That suggests it was the ancient equivalent of a dress uniform. This style of helmet was not actually that common — but this particular image has spawned many incorrect modern costumes, courtesy of 19th century painters and 20th century prop departments.

The other function of crests is protective. In most examples the crest is not usually solidly attached to the helmet itself; instead it’s attached via a spike or a peg. A downward blow on the head will hit the crest holder, and much of its force will be devoted to bending or breaking the crest holder and the spike rather than transmitted directly to the skull of the wearer. Since Roman helmet liners were pretty simple, typically just felt or linen padding, it made sense to add a “crumple zone” for protection. That’s another reason the Praetorian style helmets were uncommon: they seem to have lacked this feature.

This may be another reason why ordinary legionary helmets had a crest holder, even though the artistic evidence suggests most legionaries didn’t use crests: it could have been a personal choice for protection or personal identification.

In the Republican period there seems to have been more individual variation; under the empire equipment becomes more standardized.
