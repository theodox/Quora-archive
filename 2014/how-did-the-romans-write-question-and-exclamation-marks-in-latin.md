Punctuation marks are a pretty late invention. Most older Latin was written en bloc without punctuation. Inscriptions often used points as a word separator, or sometimes to indicate abbreviation. (They did use a lot of abbreviations, generally by dropping big chunks of words and relying on context).

Most of our punctuation evolved between the 13th and 18th centuries. Medieval scribal tradition evolved a lot of conventions for spacing, managing abbreviations more systematically, and indicating breaks in the text such as chapters or verses. The Renaissance / early modern period invented most of our marks - the quotations, exclamations, etc.
