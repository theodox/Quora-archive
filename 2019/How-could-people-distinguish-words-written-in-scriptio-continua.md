The short answer is “with difficulty.” While it’s inconvenient, you can certainly do it yourself:

Or, in an unusually fine example of a high quality text:

I won’t do the whole thing, but since this is lovely, continuous text, you can see it begins

> Carmina tua melius cum venerit ipse canemus

In other words, its the last line of Virgil’s ninth eclogue (the red text is the title for the tenth). I didn’t cherry pick the text, I found a nice looking piece of late-antique text in an image search and turned it around quickly (I think this image is from the [Vergilius Palatinus](https://bibliotheca-laureshamensis-digital.de/bav/bav_pal_lat_1631), so probably around 500 AD).

That example does however make a relevant point. We moderns are typically at a disadvantage compared to the original readers — we are frequently confronted with fragmentary artifacts (texts or inscriptions) that are out of context, where the contemporary readers typically understood the nature of the texts they saw : “oh, that’s on the pediment of a temple, of course it’s a dedication” or “I pulled this from the cubby which says _Diodorus book I_ ”.

For us, who find mutilated manuscripts or broken inscribed stones, things can be a _lot_ trickier. Consider the example above with less context, the kind of fragment that many palaeographers would instantly recognize:

> ]icharegene[]all[]asier[]odistin[]uish[]omcapita[]because[]ft[]eirv[]r[

In a case like that the job of serially unrolling the words becomes much more laborious.

__TLDR__ for an ancient reader it’s a doable job, though it’s definitely less efficient than modern orthography. Familiarity would make it less daunting, and in combination with the context which we moderns usually lack it was possible for a reader to manage. The context where we typically encounter ancient texts, however, makes _our_  task a lot harder.



Of course then there’s _[boustrophedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon)_ _,_ the rare but not unknown trick of writing each line in reverse order (ie, left to right on one line, then right to left on the next).

That stuff is wacky.
