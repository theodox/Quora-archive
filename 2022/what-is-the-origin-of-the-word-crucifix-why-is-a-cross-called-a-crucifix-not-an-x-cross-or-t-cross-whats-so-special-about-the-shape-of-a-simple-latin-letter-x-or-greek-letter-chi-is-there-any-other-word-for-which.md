# What is the origin of the word "crucifix"? Why is a cross called a crucifix, not an X-cross or T-cross? What's so special about the shape of a simple Latin letter X (or Greek letter chi)? Is there any other word for which this applies?

Crucifixion refers specifically to a person bound to a frame, not to a cross by itself. It’s from the Latin _[crux](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=crux&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059)_ (a frame or beam) and _[figo](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dfigo)_ _._ “attach” or “set up.” A cross shape without a human figure is just that — a cross.

The Romans were quite inventive with their range of torture devices. The X shape, T shape, and + shape are all attested but so are plain upright beams; the same word covered all of them. The original biblical word we traditionally translate as “cross” is σταυρός. In very ancient Greek this (like _crux_ ) meant a stake or pole, although long before the Roman era it had come to cover the same range of instruments of torture.
