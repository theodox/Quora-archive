Rome was still a small, not very important city state in Alexander's day. If he worried about strategic threats to the west he would have worried about either the famously wealthy Greek kingdom of Syracuse in Sicily, which had defeated the mighty Athenian empire a century earlier:

or his immediate western neighbor, the [kingdom of Epirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epirus_(ancient_state)#Molossian_expansion_.28470.E2.80.93330_BC.29), which was a powerful force in its own right.

There is no evidence that Alexander worried about his western flanks at all, however, although a few people have guessed that the foundation of Alexandria in Egypt might have been some kind of strategic position directed against Carthage (in modern Tunisia). That's just supposition.

In fact it was [Pyrrhus of Epirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus) - a young cousin of Alexander's - who was the first Greek to face off against a Roman army in serious battle. His ill-fated adventures in Italy gave rise to the English phrase "[Pyrrhic victory](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-called-when-there-is-a-battle-in-which-both-sides-lose-a-______-victory)" -- the kind where winning is almost as bad as losing.

Pyrrhus beat the Romans at [Battle of Asculum (279 BC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Asculum_(279_BC)) -- but within a generation the Romans would begin their gradual domination of the Greek kingdoms, starting with southern Italy and Sicily but absobing the entire Greek world within 200 years.
