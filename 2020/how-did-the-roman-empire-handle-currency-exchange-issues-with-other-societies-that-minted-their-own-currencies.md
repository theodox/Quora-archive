It wasn’t really a concern in antiquity; the value of money was just the weight of gold or silver it contained. As long as you had a scale (and probably, some experience spotting coins that had been padded out with base metals) you could do business. And you needed that scale for any significant transaction — lots of people used to shave the edges off of coins and keep the shavings.

A corollary to this is that coins never really went out of circulation. Sometimes cash-strapped emperors would try to [collect existing coinage and re-mint it with more low-value metal, effectively “printing money”](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Roman-coins-decrease-in-value-during-the-A-D-200s/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=0df47825&srid=zLvM). Consumers tended to view this with great resentment; one the best ways to be regarded as a good emperor was to have high quality coinage. So[ high-quality coins were often hoarded long after their day.](https://www.quora.com/In-the-later-Roman-Empire-were-coins-from-Augustus-and-other-early-emperors-still-in-circulation/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=34a63039&srid=zLvM)

_Technically this is a ‘foreign coin’ — a gold stater issued by the Senones, a Gallic tribe. However to a Roman (or anybody else in the ancient world) it was just a lump of gold._ 

It’s rare but far from unheard of to find Roman gold coins in places as far abroad as China and Vietnam, where they continued in use long after the Romans lost contact with the orient for the same reason: they were just lumps of precious metal.

_Roman coins found in India. The slash markings are probably from a local merchant making sure the coins were gold all the way through._
