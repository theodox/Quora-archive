Hannibal was the enemy of Rome, certainly.

Hannibal’s ancestry was primarily Semitic, since he descended from the settler aristocracy of Carthage, who traced their roots back to Phoenicia (modern Lebanon).

It’s likely — though we don’t have records of it — that some of his ancestors were Numidian or Libyan. The Carthaginian aristocracy intermarried with their neighbors from at least the time of the first Punic War, two or three generations before Hannibal’s time, and one of his sisters married a Numidian prince. The Numidians and Libyans were both the ancestors of modern [Berbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers) who are still a large portion of the population of Tunisia, Algeria and Libya.

This is believed to be the only contemporary portrait of Hannibal:

On his coins he depicted himself (or possibly, his father) like this:

You’ll sometimes see links to coins like this:

Which are mis-identified as Hannibal. It’s unlikely because (a) the mint mark is in Italic script, not Carthaginian and (b) there are many examples of Barcid family coins dating back to Hannibal’s father’s day — that’s why there’s debate about whether the image above is Hannibal or his father. The usual guess is that the second coin here was minted in Italy by an Etruscan city that sided with Hannibal after his invasion. The African looking coins are all very small denominations in bronze, where the other Barcid coins are larger pieces in silver.
