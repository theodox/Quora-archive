Good range of answers here. Another part of this is the hoary fantasy trope of [Law and Chaos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_Chaos) which goes back at least as far as [Michael Moorcock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moorcock) but has roots in both the Robert E. Howard "swords and sorcery" wing of the genre (and, of course, is a key axis on the [D & D alignment chart](http://www.themarysue.com/best-alignment-charts/).) 

In theory, at least, "Law" and "Chaos" are more complex than the old standbyes "Good" and "Evil" -- they represent different approaches to good, rather than sneering villains who are bad for badness' sake. It is, however, very hard to pull that off convincingly and they tend to collapse into good-lite and evil-lite depending on the preferences of a given writer. AC has definitely had trouble keeping those apart. For one thing, it's definitely a lot easier to find would-be writers who incline to the capital-C chaotic world view, just like it's much easier to find would-be cops who incline towards Law. Plus, the whole Dan Brown angle definitely inclines the series towards an anti-authoritarian, thus Assassin-friendly perspective.
