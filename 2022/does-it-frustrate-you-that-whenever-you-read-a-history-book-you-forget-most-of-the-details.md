Apologies in advance for a very roundabout answer the question.

I am low-key obsessed with observing the nature of the details that stick with me. The prominence which some details assume in memory is an interesting clue to the process of analysis and hypothesis formation. So when my brain is doing the triage which sends some things from short-term to long-term recall and consigns others to oblivion, it’s a clue to how I’m test-fitting pieces into my mental model of what’s going on in a given time and place.

To give a concrete example, a friend gave me a copy of _[A Cabinet of Byzantine Curiosities](https://amzn.to/3bUY7DG)_ _—_ a lightweight book in which a Byzantinist collects funny (or often, gruesome) minor incidents of Byzantine history. It’s all anecdotal stuff, no grand thesis or key insight, but I can definitely see how some items tickle my hindbrain differently from the rest.

Here’s one bit that caught my eye:

> In a letter, the twelfth-century philosopher Michael Italikos compares his classroom to the scene of a banquet where his students are treated to logical treats. The food consists of courses in philosophy, mechanics, optics, solids, center of gravity, and the like, and has its corresponding sausages and honey-sweets. Pythagoras and Plato are the wine-bearers, while Aristotle and the Peripatetics are the cooks, making the Academy their servants. Desserts consist of Stoicism, Skepticism, and whatever is known of barbarian philosophies, especially Chaldaean and Egyptian. Musical accompaniment is provided by literary genres such as epic, tragedy, comedy, and satire. ‘This, then, is what my “eatery” is like ([Letter 18](http://narses.hpdst.gr/node/372)).’

The book has several dozen anecdotes, with plenty of spicy Byzantine stuff — lecherous saints, cross-dressing nuns, empresses blinding their own sons, Greek fire, people being sawn in half, even Byzantine fart jokes.

So I ask myself, _Why this one?_ 

I think it’s that this anecdote sits at the intersection of several themes that I’m already interested in and that it adds a little depth to some thoughts I’ve already entertained. I’m interested in the deep intimacy — and sometimes, the pedantic preciousness — of the Byzantine relationship with classical antiquity (an example [here](https://www.quora.com/Where-and-how-were-the-ancient-Greek-texts-preserved-between-the-period-of-their-writing-and-the-time-when-they-were-found-and-translated-by-the-Arabs/answer/Steve-Theodore)) It’s also a fun example of ancient fanboy culture : a way for Italikos to demonstrate affectionate knowledge of a bunch of fairly obscure references in a way that only his fellow geeks would truly appreciate, which I find makes a helpful link between ancient literary culture and internet life. And it’s also just a good factoid — a solid demonstration of the fact that a relatively worldly educated person of 12th century Constantinople was fluently conversant both the first and second rank of all the ancient schools, another refutation if one were needed of bunkum about “dark ages” and “superstition” (at the time of this writing, Italikos was a professor of medicine; he was eventually bishop of what is today Plovdiv in Bulgaria).

All of this makes it easily digestible to me, though not necessarily to the next person to browse that book. In many ways “Memorability” equates to how well a detail slots into — or more rarely, how radically it challenges — a general mental model I already have. If this were a book about, say, Mughal India I might not have had enough context to see that a somewhat overblown simile about dead philosophers was worth jotting down on a mental post-it. Since this bit touched on things I already had a context for, it survives while plenty of other, arguably juicier, stuff does not.

Though, to be fair, second place goes to [the whale that attacked Byzantine ships in the Bosporus](https://thehistorianshut.com/2020/06/28/the-tale-of-a-monstrous-whale-that-harassed-ships-in-the-age-of-justinian/), which does actually have an undeniable quotient of pure, unadulterated “WTF???” It’s going to stick with me for pure spectacle value… but also, [that same whale actually gets a walk-on part in Moby Dick](https://www.superdoomedplanet.com/blog/2009/03/30/the-secret-history/), which I love.

Nonetheless: I’d argue that memorability is mostly a function of how your larger mental map of the historic landscape works. When you’re just starting out in a new area, its big things: battles, revolutions, the building of great monuments. You need these just to keep your basic facts straight. When you’re on familiar ground, though, it becomes more subtle and interesting . Once you have a general idea of how the background matte-paintings look, you can afford to focus on the foreground detail. The same book will yield very different levels and types of details the fifth time you read it and than it did on the first go-round.

With the proper context it’s not hard to find the place where a particular fact slots in, just as it’s easier to fit a piece into a mostly-complete jigsaw than it is to start from a heap of pieces. I don’t, for example, have regnal dates for most Roman emperors at my fingertips. Thanks to my grads school orals, however, I do still have the _sequence_ down through Caracalla, because the sequence has a fairly coherent story that does not make sense in another order. After Caracalla, however, as things devolve into fifty years of military thugs murdering each other at random I can’t keep it straight because there’s no structural thread to keep it together — it’s just memorization, which I’m pretty bad at.

Interestingly, outside simple questions of chronology there’s more of a circular relationship between the pieces and the jigsaw puzzle — the structure makes the content memorable, but ultimately its the content which validates the structure. If you collect anecdotes of a particular genre, you can make a history of almost anything; the temptation to glue anecdotes some kind of interpretive framework without regard to things like the the vagaries of information survival and the limitations of different sources has led to a lot of rather over-enthusiastic social and cultural histories that don’t outlast the modern cultural moment that gave them birth.



Anyway — you cannot say you weren’t warned — all of this is a very long way of saying _“it does not really bother me that I don’t have perfect recall of details.”_ History has always been about the dialectic of memory and forgetfulnes. Old Herodotus kicked the whole shebang off like this:

> Ἡροδότου Ἁλικαρνησσέος ἱστορίης ἀπόδεξις ἥδε, ὡς μήτε τὰ γενόμενα ἐξ ἀνθρώπων τῷ χρόνῳ ἐξίτηλα γένηται, μήτε ἔργα μεγάλα τε καὶ θωμαστά, τὰ μὲν Ἕλλησι τὰ δὲ βαρβάροισι ἀποδεχθέντα, ἀκλεᾶ γένηται

> What Herodotus of Halicarnassos has learnt by inquiry is here set forth: in order that so the memory of the past may not be blotted out from among men by time, and that great and marvellous deeds done by Greeks and barbarians not lack renown.’

Choosing to remember a particular detail can highlight a critical theme more eloquently than any table of names and dates: the image of Herodotus’ Spartans combing out their hair on the last night at Thermopylae matters more than the endless technical arguments about the precise date and order of battle. On the other hand forgetting important details can also distort a narrative into incoherence, as you’ll see if you follow many of the ways in which, say, Confederate apologists try to sidestep the role of slavery in the South of 1860.

If you want to be a history buff the goal is not to have an eidetic memory. That’s impressive but, [unless you are Matteo Ricci](https://artofmemory.com/wiki/The_Memory_Palace_of_Matteo_Ricci/), it’s just a party trick. Instead it’s to have some degree of self-consciousness about the nature of memory, individual and collective; to interrogate your own reasons for remembering one thing and not another, and to arrange your jigsaw puzzle in ways that don’t require a hammer to fit in all the pieces.

_Oh and also to double check your names and dates before hitting the “post” button. Pretty much every time I skip that, it bites me in the ass._
