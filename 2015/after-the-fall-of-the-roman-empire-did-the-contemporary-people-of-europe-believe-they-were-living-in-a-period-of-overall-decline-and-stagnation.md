Generally yes, but not for the reasons we might expect. 

The trope that the current age was degenerate and failed to live up to the standards of antiquity was really common throughout antiquity; in fact, it was a as ordinary an assumption in the ancient world as the notion of progress is in the modern one.

 You're probably familiar with the term "golden age". It was coined by the Greek poet [Hesiod](http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/) in the 6th century BC, who wrote that the men of the golden age had lived in peace and plenty, close to the gods and to nature. On the succeeding ages - silver, bronze, and iron-- men had grown progressively more selfish and corrupt. This same idea, with different poetic flourishes, shows up in many Greek and roman sources, from Plato to Ovid and a host of lesser writers. 

Part of the reason that this idea waxed so perennial was that technological progress, which we see all around us, was not a major element of ancient life: tangible evidence of things getting better was hard to find. On the other hand this was also a world in which aristocrats dominated the culture -- and aristocrats, who in general are very conscious of the fact that they have more to lose than to gain -- are often drawn to pessimism: "you can't get good servants theses days" has the aristocrat's perennial lament for 8,000 years. 

So, even without the mythological context, the elites tended to agree that things had been better in the Good Old Days, when the plebeians knew their place, the Republic was run by honest and upright patriots instead of demagogues and chiselers, and women spun yarn and raised babies instead of demanding silks of taking lovers. Roman social thought was intensely backward looking; and after the emperors came along and cut off even the chance for ambitious politicians to propose reforms in order to become popular, that bias became even more powerful. Among other things it's why the "classical" style in arts and literature persisted so long and with such continuity: "innovations" were regarded with suspicion and the greatest accolade a late-Roman emperor could earn was _restitutor orbis:_ "restorer of the world". 

So, that kind of yearning for a lost, simpler and superior world was already a strong theme in Greco-Roman literature long before the collapse of Roman power in the west (in the east, where Rome didn't fall for another millennium, the dominant mood became one of conservation: it's why we still have all those Greek classics, because the Byzantines painstakingly preserved them). Against that backdrop, it was natural for educated people to regard the era in which they lived as a broken and degenerate parody of the virtues of former times. As Christianity became part of the Latin mainstream that also extended back to the difference between the contemporary church and the purer, simpler days of the apostles. Together those two strains of thought produced a generally rueful and elegiac tone in the writings of the years between, say, 400 and 1100. 

 Of course, that's the literature, which represents the worries of a small subset of people. For a lot of people life was actually getting better, although the changes were hard to see from year to year. North-west Europe actually did better in human terms in the years between 400 and 1000 than it ever had under the Romans: the populations of Gaul and Britain more or less doubled during that time as the local people learned how to make better use of appropriate farming techniques and new technologies. None of that, however, shows up in our sources since our sources tend to reflect that older, more nostalgic literary view.
