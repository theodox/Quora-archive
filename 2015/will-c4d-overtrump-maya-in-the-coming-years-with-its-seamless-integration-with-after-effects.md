Well, Maya's marketshare lead will be hard to beat -- and C4D has even less traction in game and high end film production than it does in VFX. One thing that really drives the market is the availability of trained users, and the overwhelming majority of 3d animation and film schools teach Maya or 3dSMax (in the US anyway -- the situation is slightly more C4D-friendly in Europe). That's going to shape purchase decisions for a long time to come, since it's very difficult to convince artists to switch away from the product of their choice. 

The bigger threat to Autodesk is the subscription plan: if they overplay the the 'software as service' thing and try to squeeze too much out of their customers things could change very fast: but if they are smart and offer the customers a good deal they'll have a very hard position to outflank.
