There’s no first hand accounts that are exactly contemporary - as usual in the ancient world, the record is pretty spotty.

Hannibal’s campaign in Italy lasted from 218 to 203 BC; after a brief stay in postwar Carthage he went into exile in 195 and died in Asia Minor in 183.

The only exact contemporary writer is lost: [Quintus Fabius Pictor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Fabius_Pictor)’s work survives only in quotations by later authors.

Polybius, who is our best source for Hannibal’s career, was born in 200 or thereabouts, so he was a young man when Hannibal died. Polybius’ information is generally of very high quality (if heavily tilted towards a Roman point of view). He was closely associated with [Scipio Aemilianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scipio_Aemilianus), the adopted son of [Scipio Africanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scipio_Africanus#Marriage_and_issue) — the Roman who beat Hannibal and ended the Second Punic War. However he was writing more than a generation after the events he described: He began writing at some point during his stay in Rome as a diplomatic hostage, which began in 167 — a good 50 years after Hannibal crossed the Alps.

Livy’s account is much later, written in the early years of Augustus’ reign. It does have some solid documentary underpinnings: the Roman [Annales maximi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annales_maximi) were quite detailed and — a rarity for ancient times — very well dated. However Livy is also given to patriotic embroidery.

Appian’s [War against Hannibal](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/appian/appian-war-against-hannibal/) is from the first century. It doesn’t appear to have much content that’s not from Polybius or Livy.

In non-documentary sources we have coins which are attributed to Hannibal, mostly from Spain. There’s a clear family resemblance among the male figures so it’s logical to assume that one of them is Hannibal and the other his father, [Hamilcar.](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/hamilcar-2-barca/) However we don’t know which is which, or if these really are the Barcids and not someone else or gods like Melqart or Baal.

I’ve seen it claimed that this bust

is actually contemporary. It seems to be from Capua (one of Hannibal’s best allies in Italy). However I don’t find it in the catalogue of the [Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli](http://cir.campania.beniculturali.it/museoarcheologiconazionale) where the quotes all say it comes from so I’m not sure. There are a couple of other “Hannibal” busts floating around but they are all of later date.

__update:__  Maybe this is why I could not find it… [Bust of Hannibal on display at Bardo in Tunis](https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2016/05/bust-of-hannibal-on-display-at-bardo-in.html#xhYojqrKkYQp376P.97)
