For the same reason that dentists drills or precision machine tools are expensive: maya is a product aimed at a pretty small professional user base. Lowering the price won't significantly increase sales because ordinary folks have no need for it. Blender after all is free but hardly a household item. 

The economics also reflect the fact that most maya licenses are sold to businesses rather than individuals. Service contracts and support matter more to these kinds of customers than just price. 

On the other hand if Autodesk is too blatant about abusing its virtual monopoly over high end 3d (they own 3ds max, the main commercial alternative too!) customers may start switching away which will probably affect the price as well.
