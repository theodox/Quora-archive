The [Chad Turner](https://www.quora.com/profile/Chad-Turner-3) “laconic” answer is “no”. Modern ideas about gender and sexual identity were as alien to ancient Greece as Spartan ideas about warrior honor and eugenics are to us.

That said, the Spartans definitely participated in the Greek culture of _[pederasteia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece)_ _,_ in which young men were emotionally attached to older men. The young man (the _eromenos)_ and the older man (the _erastes)_ were tightly — and publicly — bound during later adolescence. Some thing that were written about these relationships make them seem like romance; some make them seem like what we’d characterize as child abuse; and some make it all seem like a ritualized form of mentorship. Not surprisingly, modern observers [don’t really know how to characterize this practice](https://www.quora.com/Did-Ancient-Greek-men-have-affairs-with-young-men) — it’s a complex thing and our sources are not very consistent about it.

The Spartans, like other Greeks, had a version of the pederastic relationship: adolescents would get chosen by older men for “fostering”, and that relationship would last from adolescence until the young man got married, say 14 to 24 or so.

Sparta’s local brand of the custom seems to have skewed away from the sexual end of the spectrum. Xenophon described it like this, or at least attributes this attitude to the Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus:

> If someone, being himself an honest man, admired a boy's soul and tried to make of him an ideal friend without reproach and to associate with him, he approved, and believed in the excellence of this kind of training. But if it was clear that the attraction lay in the boy's outward beauty, he banned the connectiion as an abomination; and thus he caused lovers to abstain from boys no less than parents abstain from sexual intercourse with their children and brothers and sisters with each other

Part of this local ethos of may reflect that Spartan men lived a very communal life — the community of the [mess-hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syssitia) where Spartan citizen spent much of their time was more important in Sparta than other kinds of association. One of the roles of pederasty in other Greek cities was to create bonds between upper -class families. Moreover, in the very sex-segregated societies of most Greek cities these kind of relationships were an important emotional outlet ; the Spartans, with their very tight bonds of military camaraderie may not have felt the same need . There's also Sparta’s chronic underpopulation problem — it may be that Sparta as a society was less invested in the erotic side of pederasty because it didn't want to discourage citizens from reproducing.

Tldr- Sparta like the rest of Greece did have a distinctive form of homoerotic relationship between older men and younger boys (in most of Greece there was a pretty strong taboo against homosexual relations between equals - permanent relationships between free adults were rare) The Spartan version seems to have been more sentimental and less sexual than, say, the Athenian version — but individual behavior was of course all over the place.
