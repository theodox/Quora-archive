The classic full-face helmet — usually known as the ‘Corinthian’ helmet — started falling out of favor pretty early.

The Corinthian helmets and their derivatives were designed for a very simple kind of warfare: basically the two sides lined up and charged, shield to shield — it resembled a rugby scrum as much as anything else. Most city-state armies were amateur militias and tactical finesse was not a strong point (one reasons the Spartans were so feared is that they could perform relatively fancy maneuvers).

Alexander the Great’s troops were fond of the “Thracian” type:

which had an important advantage: it left the ears uncovered, so troopers could hear commands. You can see the process at work here:

You’ll notice more and more ‘ears’ and ‘face’ as time goes on (those dates are from 800 to 400 BC or so).

Variants of that style remained common up through the time of the Roman conquest and beyond. The Romans — whose method of fighting was even more tactically complex than the Hellenistic armies’ — picked up their helmet designs from Gauls of northern Italy; these were usually pot-style helmets with cheek flaps and an open face (which made for easier communications). By the 2nd century BC the Romans were fighting in a looser formation than the Greeks had done — situational awareness and communications were even more important for them. A neck guard was added to provide protection against slashes to the neck:

This type was the basis for many subsequent ones. You can see how this Frankish example from the 8th century shows the same basic formula of open face and cheek plates.

And resembles this late Roman officer’s helmet:

There are examples of full-face masks from the Roman and later Greek periods, but these were rare and may be more of a “gentleman amateur” style than a professional tool:

In the middle ages the rise of heavy cavalry — particularly once jousting became popular — revived the full-face helmet as a regular tool of warfare. When somebody’s riding at you at 30 mph with a spear you may be less interested in being heard on the battlefield.

__Edit__ : I forgot to mention that the original Corinthian did make something of a reapparance in the [Barbute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbute), a design popular in Renaissance Italy:

The big difference of course is that the barbute is steel, while the old Greek helms are bronze. The barbute never gained much popularity outside of Italy — probably for the same reasons that led to the demise of the Corinthian original.
