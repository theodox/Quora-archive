Oooh, this one is hard because there are so many. It takes enormous self-discipline to get it down to a short list.

I think for me it’s a tie between the works of [Manetho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho), [Berossus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berossus) and [Sanchuniathon.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanchuniathon) Much as I love the classical subject matter (how ’bout them lost books of Livy? Or Claudius? or the rest of Polybius… there’s so much gone….), one really gaping hole in our knowledge of antiquity is what happened when traditions from outside the Greco-Roman cultural viewpoint collided with the Greek historiographical tradition.

_This very Greek looking fellow is probably the Babylonian_ _[Oannes](http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/mba/mba08.htm)_ _, a later version of one of the Sumerian gods of the_ _[Abzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abzu)_ _. For the record I’m skeptical that he ever_ _[visited Mexico](http://www.messagetoeagle.com/did-the-babylonian-fish-god-oannes-visit-tiahuanacu/)_ _. But if we had Berossus in his entirety we might now how this ancient story was talked about when Rome was just meeting Pyrrhus and his elephants_ 

We have a ton of primary source material from Egypt and Mesopotamia (though shockingly little from either Phoenicia or Carthage: they didn’t write long, bombastic inscriptions in stone and their books are basically all gone). What we’re missing is anything written specifically as history: when the Pharaoh catalogs his victories on the walls of his tomb, when the God-king inscribes a pillar listing his virtues in cuneiform — well, it’s interesting _source material_ but it’s doesn’t tell us much about how people tried to make sense of the world they lived in. I’d really like to know how a Babylonian like Berossus made sense of the fall of the Babylonian empire and the rise of Persia, for example, or how what Manetho thought about the age of the Ramessids jibes with what we know from archaeology (and what we get from Herodotus).

I’d particularly hope to see if these neighbor cultures picked up the Greek tradition of secular historiography and ran with it, or if their ‘histories’ were primarily grounded in their own mythical pasts. What we do have of Manetho and Berossus reaches us primarily because their works were cited as by both sides in debates between Christian and Greco-Roman pagan authors — so, perhaps for that reason and perhaps not — the remnants suggest that the works were still fundamentally grounded in a mythical rather than a historical understanding of the past. But it would be fascinating to know for sure.
