We don’t have much direct testimony to __Cyrus__ ’ beliefs, although we know he was happy to sponsor a variety of religious observances among his subjects — the famous “[Cyrus Cylinder](https://www.ancient.eu/article/166/the-cyrus-cylinder/)” from Babylon records his restoration of the temple of Bel-Marduk and his patronage of the Babylonian priesthood that staffed it (Cyrus also permitted the return of the Jews to Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple there).

Cyrus’s successors ruled under the patronage of [Ahura Mazda](https://www.ancient.eu/Ahura_Mazda/), and if the poorly attested [Ariaramnēs](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ariyaramna-greek-ariaramnes-old-persian-proper-name) is historical his predecessors did too; it’s a reasonable bet but not a demonstrated certainty that Cyrus was part of the tradition that nowadays is known as [Zoroastrianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism). Whether that would have made him a monotheist is uncertain on a couple of levels. First, because there’s no really good evidence for what the proto-Zoroastrians of his era believed (modern Zoroastrian scriptures were not written down until about a millennium later) Second, because the general religious atmosphere of ancient Persia had a strong element of dualism — modern Zoroastrians describe themselves as monotheistic (although their faith involves a hierarchy of lesser divine powers) but [Manichaeism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism) which arose in the same milieu was explicitly dualistic and without textual evidence it’s hard to know what a Persian in Cyrus’s day would have said.

As for __Alexander__ , no. He’d have a tricky time being a monotheist since he [ruled as a living god](https://www.quora.com/To-which-religion-did-Alexander-the-Great-belong/answer/Steve-Theodore).

It’s been debated ever since his time how seriously he took these claims himself, but he certainly expected others to take them seriously. In other, though, regards he was a fairly conventional Greek polytheist, and he continued to offer sacrifices to the Olympians — particularly Zeus but also Heracles — even after proclaiming his own divinity. He was also a generous patron of Egyptian temples, for[ reasons that may have been personal but were also political](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised).

However it’s also true that most Greeks frequently used language that could easily sound monotheistic — for example one of his biographers said

> Among the sayings of one Psammon, a philosopher, whom he heard in Egypt, he most approved of this, that all men are governed by God, because in everything, that which is chief and commands is divine. But what he pronounced himself upon this subject was even more like a philosopher, for he said God was the common father of us all, but more particularly of the best of us.
