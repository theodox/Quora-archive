# Why does Diwan Lugat at-Turk tells a story about how Alexander the Great got defeated by Saka even though we know that he never lost any battle? Turkish people know this story as “Şu Destanı” (Legend of Şu) but there is no English sources about it.

I can’t find an English translation so this has to be a pure guess.

The Alexander story [circulated widely in Persian language sources](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama). There are three main strands in the Persian Alexander tradition: __Zoroastrian__ sources are uniformly pretty hostile and Alexander is portrayed as a savage conqueror and enemy of Ahura Mazda. However a lot of __medieval Persian__ literature portrays Alexander in a more positive light (not coincidentally, he’s usually provided with a fictional Persian royal family connection). A lot of the incidents in this tradition come ultimately from the [Alexander Romance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Romance), a collection of pseudo-historical stories about Alexander that circulated very widely in many languages starting around the third century or so. Finally there are stories that conflate Alexander with __[Dhu al-Qarnayn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhu_al-Qarnayn)__ ____ from the Quran — in this tradition his conquests are generally portrayed as a quest to convert the world to monotheism. While the Persian-language Alexander tradition is very interesting, it’s not renowned for historical accuracy.

A Turkish language tradition in which Alexander loses to the Saka probably comes ultimately through the middle of those three streams. Some versions of it definitely made it into Turkish culture — the Persian [Shahnameh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh#On_Turkic_identity), which includes a version of the Persianized Alexander, is the most famous but not the only Persian tale to become popular in Turkish. There’s a Persian [derivative of the Alexander story ](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/darab-nama)in which the real Alexander’s marriage to Roxane is converted into a fight with a warrior queen named Būrān-doḵt whom Alexander fails to defeat until he finally seduces her. This version won’t be the exact source of the story (in it, Būrān-doḵt is a Persian princess not a Sogdian like the real Roxane) but it’s not hard to imagine a Turkish twist in which the Sogdians get assimilated to their nomadic neighbors the Sakae. It’d be interesting to know if the Sakae in turn are treated as ancestors of the Turks, or if the story borrows anything from [Rostam and Sohrab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostam_and_Sohrab).

Reader beware — the above paragraph is non-expert speculation!
