Tar-Teshub was the Hittite ambassador or negotiator and Ra-mose the Egyptian representative who drafted the “[eternal treaty](https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/prec/www/course/egypt/274RH/Texts/HittiteEgyptianTreaty.htm)” between the Hittite and Egyptian empires in about 1290 BC.

There are recorded treaties from earlier (going back at least to Sargon of Akkad, a thousand years earlier) but I don’t think any of them mention envoys by name.

Slightly less certain, there’s a passage from Ebla (in Syria) around 2360 BC which mentions somebody named Suwama-wabar, a representative of the city-state of [Mari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari,_Syria) negotiating with the city of Adu. It’s not clear from context if Suwama-wabar is a diplomat or a military leader.
