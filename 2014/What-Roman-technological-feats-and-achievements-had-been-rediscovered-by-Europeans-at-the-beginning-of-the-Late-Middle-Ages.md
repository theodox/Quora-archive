Not exactly to answer your question, but to help frame it: a lot of the differences between the way we see technology from classical times and the way we we see it from medieval times has to do with source bias.

What we know of Roman and Greek technology is heavily colored by literature. Athough we have learned a lot from archaeological sources about, say, Roman metallurgy or structural engineeering, the written sources tend to be much easier for historians to follow and they have pride of place in accounts of what was invented by whom and how. The technical names we know best , like Archimedes or Vitruvius, are because they were members of the literate elite and their work or descriptions of it became part of the written record.

In the middle ages, on the other hand, a lot of important technology was deliberately kept secret. Before patents became available (and reliably enforced) it was common for people with special technical knowledge to keep it locked away in the bosom of the family or the guild. This tended to slow down the diffusion of technology but also to mean that the invention of important things -- the forced-draught chimney, the moldboard plow, the horse collar, hydraulically operated mining machinery, the blast furnace, or eyeglasses, to name a few -- was often anonymous. Not only did the technology spread slowly due to people trying to preserve their industrial secrets, it was also harder to write about and thus frequently gets under-played in conventional histories. 

A third factor is that there was much more thorough cultural continuity in the Eastern Mediterranean. Byzantine technology - and in many ways the technology of the Muslim world, particularly before arrival of the Turks and Mongols - was a more direct linear descendant of the Roman world without the complete ruptures that took place in the west. This meant that many technoologies that were 'lost' in the west could be re-imported from the East, sometimes more than once. This is true for luxury good - water clocks, say, or magnifying glasses -- and also for literary sources: Europe re-discovered the philosophy of Aristotle and Plato, the medicine of Galen, and the geometry of Euclid first from Arab and then later Byzantine sources. However, you can't import an aqueduct or a sewer system. 

One important reason that many technologies, even though they are quite simple to implement, did not thrive in the middle ages is sheer poverty. Medieval Europe was much less populated than the Roman period - in the worst parts of the seventh century, after plagues, famines and repeated waves of invasion Europe may have had only about 1/3 as many people as it had under the Empire. Political units were much smaller and weaker than the Empire had been as well. So large, centrally planned projects were rare in large part because they were too expensive and politically taxing for smaller polities to manage. It's also pretty hard to do a lot of grand civic planning if your city is full of well-armed nobles who live in fortified neighborhoods and don't trust each other much! 

On the other hand, many labor-saving technologies - for example the use of wind and water power for mining and agriculture, or sail-only navigation -- tended to advance faster in medieval times; after the Black Death, laborers had much more bargaining power and capitalists had stronger incentives to invest in labor-saving devices. The ancient world, generally awash in slave labor, rarely bothered with productivity for mere profit.
