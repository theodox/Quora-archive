No, there’s no evidence for it. The fullest accounts of the motives we have for the conspirators are either Republican principles (Brutus), thwarted ambition (Cassius) or revenge (Cimber). Here’s Cicero, who wasn’t part of the conspiracy but knew all of the liberators well, speaking of Cleopatra a month or two after the assassination:

> I can't stand the Queen: and [her secretary] Hammonius knows that I have good cause for saying so. What she promised [me], indeed, were all things of the learned sort and suitable to my character-such as I could avow even in a public meeting… The Queen's insolence, too, when she was living in Caesar's villa across the Tiber, I cannot recall without a pang. I won't have anything to do therefore with that lot. They think not so much that I have no spirit, as that I have scarcely any pride at all!

It’s petty, alright, but hardly the stuff of which assassins are made.

All of the actual anti-Cleopatra sentiment in Rome comes from the run-up to Octavian’s [final showdown with Mark Antony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_War_of_the_Roman_Republic), when the two were fighting for final control of Caesar’s legacy. Since Antony’s power base was in the east, and Cleopatra was the main financial backer of his armies, Octavian sponsored a some nasty propaganda about her and her ‘oriental’ ways as part of his broader campaign to de-legitimize Antony and rally support for himself.

There are famous fragments of this discourse in [Horace 1.37 ](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Odes_1.37)and [Propertius III](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/PropertiusBkThree.htm#anchor_Toc201112466).11 , but the most obvious one is in [Book VIII of the Aeneid](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/VirgilAeneidVIII.htm#anchor_Toc3637710) describing Octavian’s victory at [Actium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium):

> On one side Augustus Caesar stands on the high stern,
leading the Italians to the conflict, with him the Senate,
the People, the household gods, the great gods, his happy brow
shoots out twin flames, and his father’s star is shown on his head.
Elsewhere Agrippa, favoured by the winds and the gods
leads his towering column of ships, his brow shines
with the beaks of the naval crown, his proud battle distinction.
On the other side Antony, with barbarous wealth and strange weapons,
conqueror of eastern peoples and the Indian shores, bringing Egypt,
and the might of the Orient, with him, and furthest Bactria:
and his Egyptian consort follows him (the shame!).
….Barking Anubis, and monstrous gods of every kind
brandish weapons against Neptune, Venus,
and Minerva. Mars rages in the centre of the contest,
engraved in steel, and the grim Furies in the sky,
and Discord in a torn robe strides joyously, while
Bellona follows with her blood-drenched whip.
Apollo of Actium sees from above and bends his bow: at this
all Egypt, and India, all the Arabs and Sabaeans turn and flee.

It’s definitely cast in xenophobic terms, with monstrous Egyptian deities contending against the wholesome Olympians -- but this is a totally willful bit of deception. Although Antony’s forces included Egyptian ships and sailors the war was a Roman civil war, not a war between Rome and Egypt. Octavian found it useful to portray this latest round of civil war as a foreign conflict because it helped quiet possible opposition at home — from Antony’s supporters, from the rump Republican opposition, and from ordinary people sick of a generation of civil violence. Most of all, depicting the war with Antony as a foreign war meant that [Caesarion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarion), Caeasar and Cleopatra’s son, would not be regarded as an heir to Caesar’s legacy. Antony’s counter-propaganda was centered on a very public proclamation of Caesarion’s position as Caesar’s heir, despite the fact that Octavian was his legally adopted inheritor.

The xenophobia was discarded once it was no longer politically useful. Among other things, Octavian (in his new role as emperor Augustus) was quite close to [Juba II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II), the Berber prince of Mauretania, and he personally arranged Juba’s marriage to Cleopatra and Antony’s daugher [Cleopatra Selene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_Selene_II). And — at least when presenting himself to his Egyptian subjects — Augustus didn’t have any problem adopting the same kind of Egyptianized trappings that Cleopatra was famous for:
