based on OP's description: there's nothing quite like that in Python-land, the python universe does not have an good low-overhead graphics / audio toolkit. For a six year old I'd say you might want to start easier, with something like [Scratch - Imagine, Program, Share](http://scratch.mit.edu/) or a game-maker toolkit like [The Games Factory 2](http://www.clickteam.com/the-games-factory-2/).

You could also try [Adventures in Minecraft](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111894691X.html) (i think Quora's [Martin O'Hanlon](https://www.quora.com/profile/Martin-OHanlon) is one of the authors) which is python based
