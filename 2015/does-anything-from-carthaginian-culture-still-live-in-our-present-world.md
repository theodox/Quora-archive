If you stick strictly with Carthage (not counting the many different impacts of Phoenician cultures, notably the alphabet), you have to look pretty hard to get beyond some place names:

Cartagena in Spain = [Qart Hadasht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qart_Hadasht) or 'New City' in Punic

There are several places in North Africa named [Agadir, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agadir)Punic for 'walled place'

Malta may derive from _Maleth,_ "harbor"

Some people in North Africa still remember [Omek Tannou](https://m.facebook.com/210581288999933/photos/a.938757386182316.1073741843.210581288999933/938757389515649/?type=3&source=48&refid=17&_ft_=top_level_post_id.938757389515649%3Atl_objid.938757389515649&__tn__=E) _,_ an allusion to the Carthaginian deity [Tanit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanit) : it's not really a religious observance anymore -- more on the order of the Easter Bunny -- but it is a Carthaginian holdover

Several well known Greek myths actually derive from some mix of Phoenician and Punic influence. The Greeks generally identified Hercules with the Phoenician [Melqart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melqart) and it's no accident that Hercules has adventures in very non-Greek locales: the [Pillars of Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Hercules) are in Carthaginian-explored Spain and North Africa and he temporarily takes up the burden of [Atlas -- ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology))who holds the sky on his shoulders in the Atlas mountains. It may even be a Greek borrowing of a Punic borrowing of an indigenous Berber story.

The [Tifinagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifinagh) script used to write Berber languages might derive from Punic script, though that's not clear. Our alphabet shares a common ancestor with Punic in the so-called '[Cadmean letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Greek_alphabet) ' which derive ultimately from Phoenicia, but they don't come from Carthage.

In the 17th, 18th and 19th century some characters from the period of the Punic War became very popular in western literature. Hannibal is of course the most famous but other examples include Flaubert's [Salammb√¥ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salammb%C3%B4)and Corneille's [Sophonisbe.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophonisba) Dido, the Carthaginian queen of the _Aneid_ , features in many works including several [operas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dido,_Queen_of_Carthage_(opera))

 One interesting hypothetical influence is the role of Punic sensibility in the life and work of the influential theologian [Saint Augustine, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo)who was from North Africa and is believed to have Punic ancestors. Some scholars -- notably [Peter Brown -- ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Brown_(historian))see a very 'Punic' pattern in his relationships with his mother, his attitude towards society and his use of language.
