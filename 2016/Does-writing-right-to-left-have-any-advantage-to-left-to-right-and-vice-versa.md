If you are writing in ink, it's slightly easier for a right-handed scribe to go left-to-right without smudging existing work: your hand can rest on empty papyrus. Right to left is better for lefties in the same way, but there are more righties in most populations. 

In other media (whether it's typing or clay tablets) that advantage matters less, so you see things like very old Greek carved into stone _boustrophedon,_ "as the ox plows" -- left to right on one line then right to left below it. That idea has other obvious disadvantages so it fell out of use, but other languages have similarly confusing techniques. Most eventually settle on top>bottom, left>right or right<left.

There are a lot of modern studies which show eye scanning proceeds left-to-right and top-to-bottom, but I don't know how you could tell if that's a biological quirk or if it just reflects the conditioning you get in most modern writing systems. It would be interesting to know if, say, Arabic speakers start looking at the world top-right instead of top-left.
