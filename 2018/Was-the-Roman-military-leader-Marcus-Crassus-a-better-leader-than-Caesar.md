Not by any conceivable measure. Crassus was responsible for the greatest Roman defeat between Cannae and the disaster in the Teutoburg forest: the annihilation of 40,000 legionaries at [Carrhae, in 53 BC.](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carrhae-harran-town-in-mesopotamia-where-in-may-53-b)

Crassus’s defeat was a completely unforced error. Even his Roman contemporaries recognized that Crassus’s war was a transparent grab for military glory, not a response to a threat or even a rational effort to expand the empire. Crassus was worried that Caesar and Pompey, his co-conspirators in undermining the Roman Republic, were monopolizing all the opportunities for fame and money that came along with military success. So, he cooked up a war against Parthia to give him a chance to compete.

Unfortunately, Crassus’ prior military experience was primarily his muddling through the war against [Spartacus and his rebel slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Servile_War). Even fighting that motley enemy Crassus did not distinguish himself as a dashing commander. He even lost his nerve and demanded that the Senate recall field armies from Spain and Asia Minor to help him defeat the rebel gladiators — though when the situation stabilized he forced a final battle to try to claim the credit for himself. His other big achievement in this war was the reinstatement of the ancient Roman punishment of [decimation](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-historical-evidence-of-Roman-legions-performing-decimation-of-their-troops): killing every tenth man in a unit that had fled from the battlefield.

With all that going for him, Crassus set off for Parthia at the head of seven legions — a large force of about 40,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry. For about a year he did alright, since he was fighting in settled territory against garrison troops. Apart from the small garrisons, the Parthian opposition only totaled about 10,000 horse archers.

Confidently, Crassus decided to press on… into the broad, cavalry friendly and poorly watered plains of Mesopotamia.

His arrogance and disdain for regional allies made it hard for him to find reliable guides and scouts. His force was centered on foot-soldiers (_armored_ foot soldiers, carrying big shields) on what’s now the northern border of Syria — not exactly a desert, but not a cool or shady country. It was only May — not the full furnace heat of a Syrian summer — but it was a hard place to tote 20 pounds of chainmail and a 20 pound shield.

Above all, Crassus failed to grasp that his route was perfect ground for the Parthians. Their horse-archers could hit and run at will in the open country while Crassus’s footsloggers could not get at them. The problem was compounded by the fact that Crassus mistook Parthian hit-and-run tactics for a retreat. So, he pushed his men to pursue what he thought was a scared enemy, leaving them exhausted and far from supplies or cover.

Meanwhile the Parthian general Surena organized a massive camel-train to supply his men with arrows. This let them keep up their barrages, offering the Romans no respite and allowing them to stay out of range. Crassus’ haphazard line of march offered no cover and no natural defenses for the Romans to organize around. Crassus defied the advice of his military advisors and tried to bull his campaign through on sheer bloody-mindedness alone.

It did not work.

Crassus sent his own son, Publius, to lead his cavalry in an effort to drive the Parthians off. The cavalry — Gauls, on loan from Caesar — had some success but they too could not come to grips with the horse archers who outnumbered them 2:1. Eventually they were surrounded and shot full of arrows. The Parthians soon paraded Publius Crassus’s severed head in front of the beleaguered Roman camp.

Crassus seems to have lost his will at that point, and his subordinates had to organize a retreat to the town of Carrhae.

When the Parthians surrounded the place, the troops demanded that Crassus negotiate a surrender, which he set out to do. However a fight broke out during the parley — probably due to a misunderstanding — and Crassus was killed. His head was sent to the Parthian king — a Greek actor displayed it as a prop while presenting Euripides’s tragedy _The Bacchae._ From Crassus’s army of 44,000, about 10,000 made it home to Roman territory. About the same number were resettled as slaves in Turkmenistan. The other half died.

So… __no__ . Crassus was not a better general than Caesar.

The most readable account of the debacle is Plutarch’s _[Life of Crassus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html)_ _._
