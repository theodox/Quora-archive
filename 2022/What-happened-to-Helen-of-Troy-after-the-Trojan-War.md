There's not just one answer. Millennia before anybody ever uttered the word “multiverse,” Helen had a dazzling array of alternate universes, retcons, and incarnations.

The most well known and widespread version of Helen’s fate is, interestingly, also the most reticent. In the _Odyssey_ , young prince Telemachus goes to Sparta hoping to get news of his missing father, still absent ten years after the fall of Troy. He goes to the palace of Menelaus and is received by the Menelaus and Helen. They are a comfortable, affectionate, middle aged couple — the only blot on their domestic happiness is the fact that they never had a son. The poem offers no explanation of how they were reunited or reconciled (the whole thing is in [Odyssey, IV](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Odyssey4.php#anchor_Toc90267392)).

_Helen and Menelaus as a comfortable middle-aged couple, following the tone of the Odyssey. By Jan Styka, 1901_ 

There are, however, some darker undertones in this cozy picture; both Menelaus and Helen bears scars from their adventures over the previous twenty years. But these are muted: the dominant note is resigned sadness rather than outrage, terror, or PTSD. They will share a drink and shed a tear for those who lost their lives in the war – but even in their cups, vengeance and score settling between Menelaus and his wife are nowhere in evidence.

In this version Helen is happy to be home. Near the end of the war, she caught Odysseus spying inside the walls of Troy, but let him return to the Greek lines unreported:

> But when I had bathed him, anointed and clothed him, and solemnly sworn not to name him in Troy as Odysseus before he reached camp and the swift ships, he revealed the Achaean plans. And after slaying many Trojans with the long sword he returned to the Argive host with a wealth of information.

> While the rest of the Trojan women were wailing their grief, my spirit was glad, since my heart was already longing for home, and I sighed at the blindness Aphrodite had dealt me, drawing me there from my own dear country, abandoning daughter and bridal chamber, and a husband lacking neither in wisdom nor looks.

[Odyssey: IV.252 ff.](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Odyssey4.php)

Menelaus accepts this all no hint of reproach. Without rancor, he tells how Helen was led around the horse, calling out the names of the Greek heroes within, even imitating the voices of their wives. Yet Menelaus passes this off with a shrug: it's merely mentioned to illustrate Odysseus's cleverness, not Helen's treachery. She came "summoned it may be, by some god,” he says, “who thought to hand victory to the Trojans."

This is one the most enigmatic moments in all of Greek literature. How do we get from Helen the object of desire, Helen the heedless floozy, Helen the victim of terrible trauma, Helen the suicidal captive, to Helen the comfortable middle-aged _hausfrau_ , serving drinks for her fond old hubby? If nothing else, the _Odyssey's_  Helen plumbs the psychological gulf that separates from the world of Homer – surely, we think, it can't be _this_ easy to kiss and make up?

But it's not just us who want to know more, to understand how we could get to this resolution. The unanswered questions in this scene ripple throughout the rest of the Greek canon, creating many contradictory ways of envisioning Helen, her role, and her fate.

__The "False Helen"__ 

That quiet interlude in Sparta includes one detail which formed the basis of an entire tradition about who Helen really was. In the _Odyssey_ , the poet makes a point of mentioning that the couple had returned to Sparta via Egypt:

> While he deliberated, from her tall, scented room came Helen, like Artemis of the golden spindle: and her companion Adreste placed a finely-wrought chair for her, Alcippe brought a soft wool rug, and Phylo a silver basket, a gift from Alcandre, wife of Polybus in Egyptian Thebes, where men own homes that reveal the greatest wealth.

_Odyssey IV, 121ff_ 

Several poets – most famously, the tragedian [Euripides ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides)in his _[Helen](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/EuripidesHelen.php)_ __ – used that Egyptian interlude to resolve the tension between Helen-the-runaway-bride and Helen-the-cherished-wife by magicking it away.

In the _Helen_ , Menelaus arrives in Egypt only to find that the woman he had captured at Troy was in fact a magical illusion, shaped from a cloud – a phantom created by Hera and Zeus in order to provide a pretext for the war:

> she made our marriage void by handing over to Paris, king Priam’s son, not me in person but a breathing ghost that looked exactly like me, a phantom she shaped out of ether.
So, Paris thought he had me in his arms but all he had was his imagination.

> And then Zeus added to all these problems something of his own making. A plan to lessen Earth’s burden of too many mortals and, at the same time, to make known to everyone, once and for all who was the bravest man in the whole of Greece. So, he concocted a war between the Greeks and the poor Trojans!

> My name and not my body was placed as a trophy between the spear of the Greeks and the bravery of the Trojans.

[Helen, 30–42](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/EuripidesHelen.php)

The reunited couple (whose marriage, in this telling, was merely interrupted rather than violated) escape from Egypt by working together to deceive a lecherous pharaoh. This Helen is a sympathetic heroine – she's the victim of a terrible slander concocted by the gods themselves, but she cannot help feeling responsible for all the bloodshed done in her name. She's no mere passive, captive princess either; it's Helen who contrives the trick which lets them escape Egypt.

This upbeat explanation of Helen's fate quite widespread version in antiquity, although it always coexisted with darker alternatives. Euripides's version is the most famous but the story of the "false Helen" and the escape to Egypt was not his personal invention. It was clearly circulating pretty early – the oldest known example comes from the poet [Stesichorus](http://www.hellenicaworld.com/Greece/Person/en/Stesichorus.html) , two centuries before Euripides.

According to legend his first work on the Trojan war told the story in the traditional way, that Helen eloped voluntarily. Suddenly, the story goes, he was struck blind by Helen's power from beyond the grave. Realizing his mistake he wrote a second version which told the "true" story of her flight to Egypt and regained his sight:

> She further displayed her power to Stesichorus the poet; for, having used insulting language concerning her at the commencement of an ode, he rose up bereft of eyesight; but when, recognising the cause of his affliction, he composed his recantation, as it is called, she restored to him the faculty of sight."

[hIsocrates, Helen, 64](http://www.gpullman.com/8170/isocrates_helen.php)

The desire to let Helen off the hook reflects, in part, the fact that in many Greek cities Helen held same semi-divine status as heroes like Theseus, Heracles, and [her brothers, Castor and Pollux.¹](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_and_Pollux).¹) The Spartans, for example, had two different shrines to Helen and Menelaus, [one of which can still be seen today](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/classics/intranets/students/modules/greekreligion/database/clunbf/). As Isocrates noted:

> Since then she has power both to punish and reward, it is the duty of the wealthy to propitiate and honour her with offerings, sacrifices, and processions, and of philosophers to endeavour to speak of her in terms worthy of the material at hand; for such is the tribute that it befits the educated to pay.

[Isocrates, Helen, 66](http://www.gpullman.com/8170/isocrates_helen.php)

_The so-called "Menelaion" near Sparta was, from around the time that the Homeric poems assumed their current form, a popular pilgrimage site. Archaeologists have found dedications to Helen among the artifacts, indicating that the Spartan couple received divine honors together and individually at the site. Photo:_ [Kevin Norman](https://www.flickr.com/photos/coemgenus/30722359121).

It's hard to be certain how the Homeric tradition as whole relates to these religious observances. Was Homer's Helen a literary adaptation of an existing local religious tradition, or did the religious observances really begin as ritualized fan art? Was Helen some kind of archaic goddess made over into a mortal character, or did she emerge as a vessel for hopes and dreams that had no other expression in the narrow world of the Greek Dark Ages? However came about, though, the cleaned up version of Helen who never really did anything wrong seams intuitively to represent the deference of Helen-the-literary-character to Helen-the-local-demigoddess Unless, perhaps, the whole business was an [adaption of a Greek tradition for a more moralistic foreign audience?](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-ancient-Egyptians-read-Homer/answer/Steve-Theodore)

As always in the contradictory world of Greek mythology, multiple overlapping answers are inevitable. Wherever it came from, though, this squeaky-clean Hollywood retelling is probably the single most popular version of the many competing Helens in antiquity.

__Other fates__ 

Nonetheless – As with comic book characters – you can always find alternate tellings of Greek myths – even in works from the same author. Like any modern comic canon, artists and writers revisited the most compelling characters again and again, reinterpreting them from a multitude of conflicting and sometimes irreconcilable points of view.

The moment when Helen and Menelaus first met in the burning ruins of Troy was an almost irresistible setting for poets and artists, even well into the 18th century. It provided a different way to portray Helen and Menelaus in a moment of high drama.

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7ca4b3742b4b526683aa34bcb62fb13d-pjlq)

_Menelaus confronts Helen in the ruins of Troy, dropping his sword as he sees her beauty again after ten years. From an Athenian vase ca. 470 BC in the_ [British Museum](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1837-0609-71).

The most famous literary version of the confrontation is in Euripides's [Trojan Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trojan_Women), done just three years before his _Helen_  quoted above. In this play there is no coziness, no familiarity, and no forgiveness. A pitiless Menelaus arrives to haul Helen home to Sparta for execution. The Trojan women of the play's title don't see Helen as a passive prize to be fought over by without rancor. They see here as the woman who brought ruin on their city, and they want to kill her. "Has anyone ever caught you tying a noose around your neck, or sharpening a knife?" they cry, "that’s what a brave woman would have done, if she really loved her first husband!"

In this version, there is no warm glow of domestic reconciliation. Helen's defense is less than convincing: Don't blame her, blame queen Hecuba who gave birth to Paris. Blame Aphrodite, who made Paris irresistible to her. Blame Menelaus, for letting Paris into his home. And in any case, Greece has benefitted from the whole affair: who now controls the Aegean? In any case, it's not my fault: _"If you must punish anyone, Menelaus, then punish Zeus!"_ ([Trojan Women, 915ff](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/TrojanWomen.php))

This weaselly defense works about as well as you'd expect. Menelaus agrees with the Trojan women that Helen deserves to die: he just wants to handle matters himself, and Helen is dragged off stage to be sent back to Sparta for execution.

Nevertheless, the audience knew their _Odyssey,_ and how this would end. Euripides leaves a tiny teaser in Menelaus' final scene:

> __Hecuba__  : Don’t listen to her, Menelaus! Don’t betray all those battle mates of yours who were killed for her sake. I beg you, on their behalf and on behalf of my sons!
__Menelaus:__  That’s enough, old woman. I don’t care at all about what happens to her. Men, take her to the ships. We’ll send her off to Sparta.
__Hecuba__  : In that case, Menelaus don’t let her get aboard the same ship as yours.
__Menelaus (laughing):__ O, why is that? Has she gained that much weight?
__Hecuba__  : No, but there’s no lover who doesn’t love his lover for ever.
__Menelaus:__  Perhaps... but it depends upon the heart of the loved one.

[Trojan Women, 1045ff](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/TrojanWomen.php#highlighttrojan+women)

Helen's irresistible beauty became the common way to explain how Helen the captive (who, in the _Iliad_ , calls herself a "cold, scheming bitch") became the domesticated Queen Helen of the _Odyssey_ . She was a demigoddess of incomparable beauty; men were simply helpless around her.

There are hints of this in the _Iliad_  – only the Trojan elders really seem angry at Helen, while the men on both sides seem to feel she's an object of desire that no man can be blamed for wanting to possess by himself. In many retellings Helen's bewitching beauty is deployed like a superpower: "Small wonder that Trojans and bronze-greaved Greeks have suffered for such a woman, she is so like an immortal goddess." ([Iliad III.156](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Iliad3.php)). Stesichorus, the originator of the "false Helen" story said that when the Greek army prepared to stone the illusionary Helen to death, the sight of her beauty transfixed them and the rocks fell from their hands. (Stesichorus, fr. 106f). A more lighthearted take on the idea comes from the Athenian comedy [Lysistrata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysistrata)) There, the women trying to end the Peloponnesian War by holding a sex strike claim their frustrated husbands will throw away their swords, "just like Menalaus, when he saw the bosom of his naked Helen."

__A woman scorned__ 

All the rage of Greek manhood could not lay a finger on the daughter of Zeus and the favorite of Aphrodite. This might be a commentary on the divine power of her parentage, or on the moral fiber of your average Achaean. In either case the voices which berate, accuse, or threaten Helen in the aftermath of the war belong primarily to women. We've already met Hecuba, but she wasn't the only woman who wanted Helen dead. In his [Orestes ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orestes_(play))Euripides (again!) show us Helen from the point of view of an angry and embittered woman: her niece [Electra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electra).

Here, Helen doesn’t simply return home as if nothing has happened. Electra and her followers have just murdered Helen's sister, [Clytemnestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clytemnestra), to avenge the death of Agamemnon. Sparta is on the verge of civil war, and Electra's faction aren't overawed by Helen's charms:

> Our uncle, Menelaos, has just arrived from Troy. The harbour of Nauplia is cluttered with his fleet. All his ships are anchored there.

> After he left Troy he wandered about the seas for a very long time.

> He was afraid about his wife’s welfare though. Sent her off to the palace in the middle of the night last night, ahead of him, to escape the wrath of those whose sons were killed beneath the tall towers of Troy. He was afraid they might throw stones at her.

> Helen! She’s taken on the role of the “ill-fated one!”

> She’s in there now, crying and grieving the death of her sister and all the misfortunes that her family has suffered.

[Orestes, 51ff](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Orestes.php)

Electra and her brother [Orestes ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orestes), having avenged their father, want protection from Menelaus. But – in large part because Helen is so unpopular – he's unwilling to go out on a limb for them. In despair, the pair plan to murder Helen and her daughter to punish Menelaus and rally everyone who suffered because of the war to their cause.

> __Electra__ : Murder her, men! Kill her, men! Plunge your swords into her, men! Hit her again and again, men! This is the whore who has betrayed her husband and her land! This is the whore who has killed thousands of Greek men!

> Killed them and maimed them by the roaring waters of the Trojan river, Scamander! By the battlefields where iron let loose tears upon tears!

[Orestes, 1302ff.](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Orestes.php)

Where other Greek men may have quailed, Orestes — who has already murdered his own mother, and is on the edge of madness — doesn't hesitate. But as lunges to make the final blow, Helen simply disappears like an illusion crafted out of ether. Baffled and outraged Orestes takes Helen's daughter Hermione hostage. Menelaus and his men prepare to storm the palace where Orestes and Electra are holed up; the city will explode into civil war. Out of nowhere Apollo appears and forces them to reconcile. Helen, he says, has been taken up into the heavens and granted immortality as a star, like [her brothers.²](http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/gemini.html).²) Orestes is sent off to Athens for trial (though Apollo tells him in advance he'll be acquitted) and on his return he'll be married to Hermione. Menelaus is instructed, as an afterthought, to find himself a nice girl and remarry. Order is restored, a key landing place for any Greek tragedy.

This version juxtaposes the human and the divine Helen starkly. The natural resentments of all the many people impacted by Helen's actions are a key driver of the conflict — right up to the moment where they are erased by Apollo's intervention. Helen may not have been a particularly good woman but she was Zeus's daughter and Aphrodite's favorite and that, in the end, was what counted. Euripides is notoriously the inventor of dramatic _[deus ex machina](https://gordianplot.fandom.com/wiki/Deus_ex_machina)_ _;_ here as elsewhere he relies upon the overriding power of the divine to try to bind up the irreconcilable human needs . The end of the Orestes is simultaneously the harshest _and_ the most exalted depiction of Helen's fate, its contradictions hogtied — if not resolved — by heavenly fiat.

__The Trojan view__ 

Not everyone in antiquity was satisfied that kind of forcible resolution of the tension between Helen the divinity, Helen the adulteress, and Helen the bad luck charm. It's not an accident that the most lasting negative image of Helen's later life appears in the [Aeneid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid) which — not unlike the _Trojan Women_  — starts from a Trojan point of view.

As the Trojan hero [Aeneas ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneas)searches the burning ruins of Troy for his family, he spies Helen taking refuge at an altar of Vesta.³

> Afraid of Trojans angered at the fall of Troy,
Greek vengeance, and the fury of a husband she deserted,
she, the mutual curse of Troy and her own country,
had concealed herself and crouched, a hated thing, by the altars.}
Fire blazed in my spirit: anger rose to avenge my fallen land,
and to exact the punishment for her wickedness.

[Aeneid 2.570ff](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/VirgilAeneidII.php#anchor_Toc536009320)

Yet again Helen's supernatural protections override human revenge. But this time the mechanism isn’t male weakness. Aphrodite (or rather Venus: is a Roman poem) stays Aeneas’s hand. She shows him the gigantic forms of the gods as the tear Troy apart before his eyes; Helen (as she has herself claimed in so many other continuities) just a pawn in the divine game. "You do not hate the face of the Spartan daughter of Tyndareus, nor is Paris to blame: the ruthlessness of the gods, of the gods, brought down this power, and toppled Troy from its heights!" (_Aneid_ , 2.605ff).

![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2add3615f2a16a77ffec09da9b75e518-lq)

_It takes more than a bit of skin to make a Roman drop his sword. Venus stops Aeneas from killing Helen in this painting by_ _[Jaques Sable, 1779.](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/helen-saved-by-venus-from-the-wrath-of-aeneas-jacques-sablet/ugEiaC3N5BmY5g?hl=en)_ 

However the Aeneid has a very complex relationship with divine fiat. Helen may not be to blame for the fall of Troy in the eyes of Venus (who, after all, really put her up to the whole affair) but the poem still can't forgive her.

In this variant, when Paris dies in the last year of the war, Helen remarries [Deiphobus](https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/deiphobus.html), the greatest remaining Trojan warrior after Hector. In this retelling (as in the _Odyssey_ ) Helen knows beforehand about the deadly payload of the Trojan Horse. Here. however, she chooses to aid the Greeks in order to buy forgiveness for herself. Here's how the ghost of Deiphobus reports the last night of Troy to Aeneas in the underworld:

> You know how we passed that last night in illusory joy:
and you must remember it only too well.
When the fateful Horse came leaping the walls of Troy,
pregnant with the armed warriors it carried in its womb,
she led the Trojan women about, wailing in dance,
aping the Bacchic rites: she held a huge torch in their midst,
signalling to the Greeks from the heights of the citadel.”
I was then in our unlucky marriage-chamber, worn out with care,
and heavy with sleep, a sweet deep slumber weighing on me
as I lay there, the very semblance of peaceful death.
Meanwhile that illustrious wife of mine removed every weapon
from the house, even stealing my faithful sword from under my head:
she calls Menelaus into the house and throws open the doors,
hoping I suppose it would prove a great gift for her lover,
and in that way the infamy of her past sins might be erased.

[Aeneid VI.513ff](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/VirgilAeneidVI.php#anchor_Toc2242934)

The Trojan-friendly version is a deliberate inversion of the story told in the _Odyssey_ : Helen may be a pawn of the gods but she's also a scheming traitor who betrays her last husband as casually as she had betrayed her first. It may be that Roman audiences (there's no evidence for a cult of Helen at Rome) were less invested in Helen's divine glamor, or simply that the Aeneid's ambivalence about pat answers extended to any effort to grant her divine immunity. We never see Menelaus and Helen together in the Aeneid but it’s hard to believe they ever lived a quiet domestic life in this universe.



¹ Helen's fame as the most beautiful woman in the world often crowds out the fact that, like her brothers, she was a child of Zeus.

² In addition to the familiar constellations, the Greeks and Romans identified luminous plasma or "St. Elmo's Fire" with Castor, Pollux, and Helen:

> Stars make their appearance both at land and sea. I have seen a light in that form on the spears of soldiers keeping watch by night upon the ramparts. They are seen also on the sail-yards, and other parts of ships, making an audible sound, and frequently changing their places. Two of these lights forbode good weather and a prosperous voyage, and extinguish one that appears single and with a threatening aspect. This latter the sailors call Helen, but the two they call Castor and Pollux, and invoke them as gods

Pliny, _Natural History_ , 2.37

³ Some modern editors believe this episode is either a garbled transmission or an interpolation of the authentic text of the _Aeneid_ . I disagree, but it's way too complex to get into here.
