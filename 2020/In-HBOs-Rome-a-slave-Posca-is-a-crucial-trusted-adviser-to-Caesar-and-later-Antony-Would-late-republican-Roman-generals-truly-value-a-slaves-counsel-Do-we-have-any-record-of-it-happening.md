# In HBO's Rome, a slave, Posca, is a crucial, trusted adviser to Caesar and later Antony. Would late republican Roman generals truly value a slave's counsel? Do we have any record of it happening?

Roman slaves were vital members of any aristocrat’s entourage. Most of any Roman politician’s “staff” would be slaves, as would the people who managed his affairs. Not unlike a modern politician Caesar would of course be anxious to present the image of being in charge of his staff — but he’d also be reliant on them for information, technical advice, and the execution of his plans.

It's important to remember is that in Rome free people regarded working for pay as marker of inferior status. A carpenter or a ox-driver might work for wages, but a gentleman did not. A member of the upper classes might work for a more important Roman as, essentially, an unpaid volunteer but would never admit to being a hireling. This kind of relationship was useful for both sides. A younger Roman would essentially be an intern, getting his own political career off the ground, gaining experience, and making valuable political connections while serving a more senior figure. Caesar did this himself as a young man, serving under Marcus Minucius Thermus in his early 20s.

However the political landscape was always in flux. Ambitious younger Romans were always on the lookout for an opportunity to ally with a more influential patron. Gaius Marius, for example, began his career as an outsider, dependent on the good will of the powerful Metelli clan; however as his own star rose he found new friends and his old patrons became his bitterest rivals.

So, a Roman aristocrat who wanted a personal entourage whose loyalties were more predictable would turn to slaves. Slavery was so common that many slaves were what we would call "professionals": doctors, engineers, business managers, and accountants, to name a few examples, were all quite likely to be slaves*. They were _legally_ on the same footing as the most terribly abused field hand or prostitute but in _practice_ their skills and institutional knowledge were too valuable to waste. So, it would be entirely in character for a first century BC Roman aristocrat like Caesar to rely on the expertise and ability of his most important slaves. Posca — who’s good with figures and has a lot of insight into the political situation as well — is precisely the kind of person an aristocrat would want as part of his staff.

Probably the best documented example of this kind of relationship is the lifelong partnership between [Cicero ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero)and his secretary [Tiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Tullius_Tiro). Throughout Cicero's career he depended on Tiro as the primary manager of his affairs, both public and private. He was the editor of Cicero's published writings and wrote a biography of his patron; although this is lost, it is the basis for most later accounts of Cicero's life. In Cicero's many preserved letters, it's easy to see the affection and trust between them. He's one of Cicero’s notes to Tiro:

> I of course wish you to come to me, but I dread the journey for you. You have been most seriously ill: you have been much reduced by a low diet and purgatives, and the ravages of the disease itself. After dangerous illnesses, if some mistake is made, drawbacks are usually dangerous. Moreover, to the two days on the road which it will have taken you to reach Cumae, there will have to be added at once five more for your return journey to Rome. I mean to be at Formiae on the 30th: be sure, my dear Tiro, that I find you there strong and well. My poor studies, or rather ours, have been in a very bad way owing to your absence. However, they have looked up a little owing to this letter from you brought by Acastus. Pompey is staying with me at the moment of writing this, and seems to be cheerful and enjoying himself. He asks me to read him something of ours, but I told him that without you the oracle was dumb. Pray prepare to renew your services to our Muses. My promise shall be performed on the day named: for I have taught you the etymology of fides. Take care to make a complete recovery. I shall be with you directly. Good-bye.

[Letters to friends/16.10](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Letters_to_friends/16.10)

The line "My promise shall be performed" refers to Cicero's promise to free Tiro, which he fulfilled shortly after the letter was written. As a free man, Tiro remained a part of Cicero's household and continued to be the manager of his literary and political affairs until Cicero was murdered by Antony and Octavian about a decade later. In _Rome,_ Posca is freed in Caesar’s will.

_This distinguished looking man is C. Aurunceius Princeps — the former slave of Caius and Marcus Aurunceius. His later career must have been particularly prosperous, since he appears here in a citizen’s toga (usually, former slaves were not full citizens though their freeborn children were). This monument was erected by Princep’s fellow freedmen.

Manumission is a key point to remember. Besides its moral problems, slavery as an institution has a terrible incentive problem: even if you've got no heart, a system where you motivate your workers entirely by coercion and fear is radically inefficient. If the best your workers can hope for out of life is simply not to be beaten or starved they'll do no more than what they must to avoid being beaten or starved; a completely exploitative form of slavery is counterproductive as well as immoral. So, ancient slavery frequently evolved mechanisms which offered a slave some kind of hope -- hope for better treatment, the ability to have some money, and quite often in Rome the chance to be freed. One interesting thing you'll note if you visit a Roman museum is how commonly tombstones are erected by freedmen and women in honor of their former owners.

Obviously, in a system as fundamentally flawed as slavery, there were many bad outcomes too: the famous Cato, who advocated the destruction of Carthage, was a notorious miser who worked his slaves to the bone and then sold them off when they were too old to be profitable. Here's the Greek author Plutarch, discussing Cato's shabby treatment of his slaves and how it fell short of the way a gentleman was expected to behave:

> .... I regard his treatment of his slaves like beasts of burden, using them to the uttermost, and then, when they were old, driving them off and selling them, as the mark of a very mean nature, which recognizes no tie between man and man but that of necessity. And yet we know that kindness has a wider scope than justice. Law and justice we naturally apply to men alone; but when it comes to beneficence and charity, these often flow in streams from the gentle heart, like water from a copious spring, even down to dumb beasts. A kindly man will take good care of his horses even when they are worn out with age, and of his dogs, too, not only in their puppyhood, but when their old age needs nursing.

> ….

> We should not treat living creatures like shoes or pots and pans, casting them aside when they are bruised and worn out with service, but, if for no other reason, for the sake of practice in kindness to our fellow men, we should accustom ourselves to mildness and gentleness in our dealings with other creatures. I certainly would not sell even an ox that had worked for me, just because he was old, much less an elderly man, removing him for his habitual place and customary life, as it were from his native land, for a paltry price, useless as he is to those who sell him and as he will be to those who buy him.

It can’t be forgotten that the legal foundation of these relationships was another matter ([see this answer for the some of the more degenerate case](https://www.quora.com/Could-Romans-do-whatever-they-want-with-their-slaves/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=e5d83736&srid=zLvM)). Nevertheless the idealized version of relations between slaves and masters was, like the idealized but not always realized version of relations between employees and employers, supposed to be based on some level of humanity. Roman comedies tend to revolve around the relations between long-suffering masters and their clever, back-talking slaves; typically the plots involve slaves manipulating their masters though ultimately for their own good. It's probably no accident that two of the top three Roman comedic playwrights (Terence and Livius Andronicus) were themselves former slaves.



* The only “professions” in the modern sense that weren’t staffed largely by slaves were the law — reserved for wealthy, well educated citizens — military command, and (interestingly) architecture which was one the few technical fields that were seen as respectable.
