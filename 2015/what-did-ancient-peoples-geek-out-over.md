Most of what is sometimes called "Silver Age" literature in Greece and Rome is effectively [retconning](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon): demonstrating your knowledge of one or more well-known classics by stitching them together in some new and unfamiliar, but still "canonical" way. The greatest example of all time is probably the [Aeneid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid), which hooks up a bunch of very familiar characters and situations from the Odyssey, the Iliad, and a variety of less famous but related epics and recasts them around Aeneas, a fairly minor character in Homer who becomes the hero of the Aeneid and goes on to found Rome, along the way interacting with a bunch of characters from Greek and Italian myth as well as actual Roman history. 

The Aeneid is unusual for the genre because it actually stands on its own; there was quite a lot of much less impressive re-interpretation and re-purposing that went on which didn't get succeed as art even though it scored a lot of fan-boy points. 

Interestingly, this pursuit makes a big comeback in the Renaissance: For Shakespeare or Petrarch, showing off your classical knowledge while still telling a good story is fan-fic taken to the next level.
