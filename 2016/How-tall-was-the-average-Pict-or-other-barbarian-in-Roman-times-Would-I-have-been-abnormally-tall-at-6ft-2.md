# How tall was the average Pict or other 'barbarian' in Roman times? Would I have been abnormally tall at 6ft 2?

You’d have stood out as tall, but not as a giant.

The Romans and Greeks definitely stereotyped some of their enemies as being unusually tall. The Gauls of Italy* were singled out as particularly large: one of the great Roman patriotic stories was a the battle between [Titus Manlius Torquatus](http://dustinsimmons.blogspot.com/2013/02/kill-gaul-get-name-titus-manlius.html) and giant Gaulish warrior on the bridge over the river Anio: the story contrasted the huge, boastful, outlandishly equipped Gaul with a grim, stalwart, business-like Roman in plain armor who, naturally, defeated the barbarian and won the day despite his smaller size. A couple of centuries later Caesar remarked again on the stature of his Gaulish enemies in France, and Tacitus describe the Caledonians — who were distant cousins of the Gauls — as ‘large limbed’.

Remains from Pompeii suggest that the average inhabitant (of a prosperous town, it should be pointed out) was about 165cm or 5′4″ . However the Romans weren’t all short: According Vegetius, writing some centuries later, the minimum standard for a legionary was 5′10″ in Roman feet, or 177 cm/ 5′6 in modern feet. Some special units in the imperial period were taller: Nero, for example, formed a legion entirely of 6-footers.** That’s a height that was regarded as impressive, but not wildly abnormal in antiquity: The Athenian comic Aristophanes, in [The Frogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frogs). makes jokes about ‘heroic six footers’ — and the Athenian foot was a little longer than our own so it works out to about 6′1″.

All of which goes to suggest that at 6′2″ you’d be regarded as impressive, but not a freak.

For non-Romans between Austria and Denmark, archaeology suggests an average height of about 174 cm or 5′7″ — taller than the Roman average but not overwhelmingly so. It’s a bit more than an inch taller than the modern Japanese average. On the other hand, elite burials are often noticeably taller; several high status men in the 6′2″ / 188 cm range have been found in Gaulish burials.***

The disparity in heights probably reflects a both genetics and nutrition. The Gaulish cultures, from Britain through the Balkans, always placed a high value on stock-raising in agriculture: ownership of herds was the primary measure of status and wealth. Gauls ate a lot of meat with a correspondingly greater protein intake. The Roman diet had a lot less beef and mutton.

_* Italy north of the Rubicon river was ‘Cisalpine Gaul’ : it was absorbed into the Roman empire long before the French parts of Gaul but the inhabitants of the two were related both by blood and by culture. For purposes of this discussion you could also say ‘Celts’ : it’s an anachronism, but basically almost all of the cultures between the Mediterranean lands and the Baltic were part of the La-Tene / Hallstadt culture complex we usually call ‘Gaullish’ on the continent and ‘Celtic’ in Britain._ 

_** Of course by Nero’s time both Gauls were long since Roman territory, so perhaps the supply of big men was greater._ 

_*** The ancient opinion was that Germans were taller than the Gauls._
