I’ve always been partial to the name _[Maximinus Thrax](http://Maximinus_Thrax)_ __ , which comes with the added benefit that he was reputedly 8 feet tall.

If you like a more Monty-Pythonish flavor, [Philipus Arabus](https://www.quora.com/Was-the-emperor-Philip-the-Arab-an-Arabian-person-or-was-he-just-a-Roman-person-and-took-this-name-only-because-his-birth-place-is-in-the-Arabia-Petraea/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=8e834be5&srid=zLvM) sounds made up even though it’s not; it’s not even clear if he was actually what we’d call an Arab which makes it extra dubious. In the same vein [Hostilianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostilian) sounds like schoolboy humor.

If you want to sound like a poorly-researched 1960’s sword and sandals epic you could be [Magnus Maximus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus) who sadly failed to live up to the name “big and best”.
