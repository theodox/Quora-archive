Is it a requirement? No, not really — compared to most professions in the same wage bracket, game development is refreshingly credential-free. While academic institutions have been offering game development programs for quite some time now, none of those degrees offers a golden ticket to a games job.

And, for the record, you should think _really_  carefully before picking up $100,000 or so of debt to get a games-only degree. The most important things to remember about a career in games are:

It’s extremely competitive. For a lot of kids who grow up playing games, making them seems like a wonderful career. Because it’s cool and sexy and at least sounds fun, the games business pulls in a lot of hopefuls. There are, for that reason, a lot of applicants for every job — just being in the middle of the applicant pool is not enough to be sure of a job.

The washout rate is very high. Between the technical difficulty of the job, the uncertainties of working in a creative field, and [the likelihood of long hours and high pressure](https://www.quora.com/Do-American-game-developers-have-time-for-their-children), only about half the people who join the games industry make it their long-term career.

For tech people, games is not a great investment. Most of the coders I know could increase their income by 30–50% by leaving games for something boring but more lucrative, like handling medical records or processing bank transactions. Like rock and roll, writing, or most sports it’s a career path where you’ll get more satisfaction than money or job security.

For these reasons: if you’ve got the chance… go to college. A real 4-year school, not a game specific school. Yes, you can get your foot in the door without a degree — but you don’t want to end up at 27 having burned out on games and not having any marketable non-games skills or experience.

Plus, it’s a creative field. Take the time to learn something about the wider world before you start reproducing it digitally.
