Let’s start off with a different North African:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4c67e780e14b45b189998e9877f4ee75)

_Septimius Severus and family. Image:_ _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severan_Tondo)_ 

The bearded fellow is Roman Emperor [Septimius Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus#Early_life) (145–211 AD — five centuries after Hannibal). To use the modern idiom he “identified” as Punic — a descendant of Hannibal’s people (Severus’s mother’s family was, however Italian). The woman in this image is [Julia Domna,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Domna) a Syrian from the city of Emesa.

Obviously, it’s not evidence for what Hannibal looked like: but it _is_ a good litmus test for how you think about these things. You need to remember that no contemporary source distinguished between the husband and wife by complexion, or commented on Severus’s skin color or that of his son [Caracalla ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla)(who grew up to be a roundly hated emperor and attracted many disparaging comments on other grounds). Does this image look like a “mixed family” to you?* That aspect aroused no comment 1850 years ago. For what it’s worth, no ancient source — and there are quite a few that talk about Hannibal — ever mentioned his complexion.

So at best this question is about trying to pin a modern perception onto a reality which was only recorded by people who weren’t looking for it. Anybody who thinks they really “know” is filling in data that is not actually there.

Begin with the famous statue — the bust that always shows up as Hannibal — is _assumed_  to be Hannibal but there’s no explicit attribution to him. The identification is made based on where it was found and how the figure is dressed. It comes from the city of [Capua](http://www.ancientcapua.com/) in southern Italy, which was the leader of Hannibal’s Italian allies, and the style of the clothing and helmet.** So it’s a reasonable guess that this non-Italian-equipped fellow in 3rd century equipment is Hannibal, but it’s only an educated guess. It could be a portrait, it could be what a Capuan artist imagined Hannibal looked like, or it could simply be somebody else.

_The Capua “Hannibal.” The chasing and decorations on the helmet are not in character for a Roman of this period,_ 

The other contemporary depictions are [Carthaginian coins](http://www.coinproject.com/search_city_result.php?city=Barcids-in-Spain&region=PHOENICIAN-AND-PUNIC&type=13), issued by not just Hannibal but also his father and brother-in-law. The most common male figures in these coins seem to show a strong family resemblance — though it’s always a possibility that the unnamed figures in the coins are supposed to be a god rather than an individual:

As always with this kind of evidence — even, as in the case of Severus, when you have color — there is a lot of room for subjectivity.

Strong supporters of the identification of the Capua bust with Hannibal think they see the same features; other observers do not. The style of the images is consistent — the long straight nose seems to be a constant in Carthaginian portraiture, it shows up in, for example, depictions of the goddess [Tanit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanit) — but what it _means_  is a matter for speculation.

The main takeaway here is, at risk of repetition, that we don’t have enough to go on. The skin color information some people crave is simply not recorded.

Hannibal was certainly an African in the geographical sense. But here, too, the identifications are ambiguous at best. His family were part of the Punic aristocracy of Carthage, descended from the Phoenician settlers who colonized the region in the 6th century BC. Their language, religion, and culture originated in modern Lebanon: the suffix _-bal_ in his name refers to the Canaanite deity __[Ba’al](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal)__ .

The relationship of the Punics with their neighbors was complicated. The local Numidians (west of Carthage) and Libyans (east of Carthage) were both related to today’s Amazigh or Berber people.They adopted some elements of Punic culture (the modern [Tifinagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifinagh) script for writing Berber goes directly back to Punic: in fact the word itself means “Punic”, just as English is written in Latin characters). A couple of centuries after Hannibal’s time there was a large mixed population east of Carthage known as “Libyphoenicians.”

On the other hand peaceful fusion of peoples was not always the case. The Punic settlers were confined to coastal enclaves until the end of the [first Sicilian War ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Wars#Carthaginian_hegemony)(480 BC) — they used the armies they had built up in that conflict to conquer the nearest Libyan settlements. Carthaginian-Libyan relations were still sufficiently testy during the days of Hannibal’s father that the the local Libyan communities rose up against Carthage after the loss of the first Punic War in 240: the [resulting struggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary_War) was so vicious that the Greek historian Polybius dubbed it the “truceless war.”

So the picture is complex. There was definitely some degree of intermarriage — Hannibal’s own sister, for example, married a Numidian king. But we don’t have enough information to know how many of his ancestors were Punic and how many Numidian or Berber.

As to how any Numidian or Libyan ancestry would have affected Hannibal’s looks… well, that’s also ambiguous — just check Quora questions about modern Berbers to see how widely opinions vary, even among people from Morocco, Algerian, Libya and Tunisia, about ‘race’ in North Africa. Generally speaking our ancient sources distinguish between “Libyans” as the inhabitants of the Mediterranean coast and what they called “Ethiopians” south of the Atlas Mountains or Tripolitania. The difference there was, at least, more pronounced in their eyes than the difference between Septimius Severus and Julia Domna.



*_Roman art traditionally depicts females with lighter skins than males, probably as a nod to beauty standards. The same skin tones are commonly used, for example, in paintings from Pompeii._ 

_** The helmet is a key to the identification: Romans in this period did not wear the familiar legionary helmet. The Punic war type, known as the_ _[Montefortino helmet](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Montefortino_helmets)_ _, was a slightly conical cap with wide hinged cheek pieces : The bust appears to wear a decorative version of a Thracian-style helmet, popular among Carthaginian citizen troops._
