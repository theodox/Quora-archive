The answer has to be a bit hand-wavey, because we don’t have any written Thracian literature — historical Thracians, when they were literate, were usually literate in Greek rather than their native tongue. The only literary sources, therefore, are Greek ones.

The Thracians first show up in the written record in the [Iliad](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Iliad10.php#anchor_Toc239245795), where they appear as Trojan allies. They already sport some identifiers that will be associated with Thracians in later times:

> If you are keen to raid the camp, the Thracians there are latecomers, and furthest out. > Rhesus son of Eioneus is their royal leader. He has the tallest, finest horses I ever saw, whiter than snow and fast as the wind. His chariot is finely worked in gold and silver, and he brought his gold armour with him, huge and wondrous to look on. It is armor fit for a deathless god, not a mere mortal.

Gold and horses were always hallmarks of the Greek image of Thracians.

While there’s no way of telling if this detail reflects anything at all about the period _described_  in the poem — usually placed just after 1200 BC — it clearly establishes that the Thracians were a recognizable ethnic group in the eyes of their Greek neighbors when the poem was finally recorded on paper, sometime in the 8th century BC; around the same time Greek cities were being settled on the Black Sea coast of Thrace so there was a good deal of cultural contact by then. This gives a nice solid _late_  date — but not much help in finding the earlier boundary.

Unfortunately the question is how much farther back we can find identifiably “Thracian” sites is harder to answer; the relationship between material goods and peoples is very complicated. It’s generally assumed that the historic Thracians are related to what’s known as the [Multi-cordoned ware culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-cordoned_ware_culture), which gets its name from a distinctive pottery style. That style originated in what’s now Ukraine and southern Russia around 4300 years ago. About 500 years later (say, 1800 BC in round numbers) that style is displaced to the south and west into the Balkans.

Sometime between 1800 and, say, 800 BC the distinct Thracian culture emerges in the Balkans, but we don’t have a lot of good ways of detailing what happened or how — whether it was a population movement or a takeover by a small military elite or whether the material culture was adopted by indigenous people in the Balkans without a change in leadership. The best we can do is the [general consensus](https://books.google.com/books?id=cMcvCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq) is that “Thracian culture emerges in the second half of the second millennium BC.”
