Its a [Gorgoneion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgoneion), that is, a stylized image of a gorgon.

The gorgon head was supposed to be a protective charm — it’s a common form in amulets and aslo in some kinds of house decorations; the monstrous face is supposed to frighten away danger. The most famous example is of course the [Aegis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegis#In_Greek_mythology), the mythological shield of Athena. However as a good-luck piece it was also a popular motif in Greek armor and shield artwork.

In Alexander’s case the image had a couple of extra propaganda purposes. Medusa, the most famous gorgon, was __[defeated by Perseus](https://www.greekmyths-greekmythology.com/myth-perseus-and-medusa/)__ __,__ whom Alexander claimed as a distant ancestor.* And Perseus scored a lot points for Alexander.

Perseus was a central figure in Greek mythology. Reminding people of the family connection helped to bolster Alexader’s credentials as a “real Greek” despite his somewhat borderline status as a Macedonian. On the other hand Perseus was also, mythologically, the ancestor of the Persians (his son, __[Perses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perses_(son_of_Perseus))__ , was supposed to have founded that nation). Thus, reminding onlookers of his connection to Perseus also meant that Alexander’s conquest of Persia was actually a _re-conquest_  by the rightful heir. And — for even more points — Perseus was an Egyptian; his great-to-the-fifth grandfather was __[Aegyptus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegyptus)__ . Alexander [went out of his way to conciliate Egyptian popular opinion](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=a89a8f4c&srid=zLvM) — emphasizing the family connection, however distant, helped to legitimize his role as heir to the pharaohs.

Finally, of course, Perseus was the__son of a mortal mother and of Zeus__  — a claim which Alexander himself made. So if you were skeptical about Alexanders title to the throne of Egypt you could still feel good about his claim of divine parentage, or vice-versa. Either way, an “endorsement” from Perseus was a powerful propaganda tool in a mythologically savvy political environment.

The gorgoneion was popular before Alexander, but his association with it rendered it a very common piece of military chic for centuries to come, even for commanders unrelated to Zeus.



*This Macedonian connection to Perseus never faded — the claimaint to Alexander’s throne, before the Roman conquest, was [Perseus of Macedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_of_Macedon).
