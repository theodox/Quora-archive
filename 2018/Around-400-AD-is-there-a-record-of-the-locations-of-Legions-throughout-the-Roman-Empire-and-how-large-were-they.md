Yes — in fact, the years around 400 are one of the very few good data points we have for the history of the late Roman military. The [Notitia Dignitatum](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/notitiadignitatum.asp), a kind of official gazette of the political and military organization of the empire, is generally dated some time between about 380 and 420 and it covers the location and command structure of the Roman military in great detail.

It’s worth noting that there is a good deal of debate about how accurate the Notitia really is. It’s clearly not completely accurate, at least not for all times within the years 380 to 420. It still describes the organization of the Roman legions in Britain — even though the last of the mobile field forces left the island in 407 or 408 and several of the northern commands had been withdrawn as early as 383. Some details of the eastern empire suggest a different date from those in the west.

Nonetheless, it’s a highly prized piece of evidence for the distribution and infrastructure of the Roman army right before the failure of the Rhine frontier and the beginning of the end of the western empire.

_A page of shield designs from the_ Notitia Dignitatum_. Among the other reasons the text is so highly prized is the fact that the it includes copies of the original color illustrations, an extraordinary rarity for texts this old._ 

[This video ](https://www.sal.org.uk/events/2016/10/pictures-in-the-notitia-dignitatum/)discusses the transmission of the images as well as something about the structure of the document. Here’s a [scanned copy ](http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00005863/images/index.html?id=00005863&groesser=&fip=86.132.15.248&no=4&seite=188)of the whole thing with color illustrations, though it’ll be difficult to read the scribal hand which tends to be a bit spiky. The [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notitia_Dignitatum) covers most of the background well.
