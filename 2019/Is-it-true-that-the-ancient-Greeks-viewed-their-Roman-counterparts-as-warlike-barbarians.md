Sort of.

“Barbarian” has a [mixed meaning in ancient Greek](https://www.quora.com/If-you-can-read-ancient-Greek-literature-was-the-word-barbarian-pejorative-Or-just-neutrally-meaning-they-couldnt-make-sense-of-the-sounds-of-the-language-these-people-spoke/answer/Steve-Theodore): there’s a pejorative sense not unlike the meaning the word has in English, connoting savagery and primitivism. There’s also a neutral usage which only means “foreigner” or “non-Greek speaker.”

Romans were definitely barbarians by the second definition. The first, however, was debatable — but in the highly fluid world of Greek politics it was easy for the negative version to come to the fore when political passions were running the wrong way.

There was not a long time for the Greeks to rely on stereotypes. Between [the first military conflict with Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Heraclea) and the beginning of Roman interventions in Greece the Greek world had a crash course in Roman politics: Pyrrhus of Epirus was surprised by the obvious sophistication of the Roman “barbarians” at Heraclea in 280 BC; by 264 the Romans had forced Syracuse, one of the richest Hellenic cities, to their alliance against the Carthaginians. By 214, the [First Macedonian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Macedonian_War) (214–205 BC) came about because many Greeks saw the superpower conflict between Rome and Hannibal, and feared that they might be next (interestingly, most of the [recorded rhetoric](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D37) from this period uses _allophylos, “_ foreign_”_  rather than “barbarian”) .

So, by the end of the 200’s [politics, rather than ethnic stereotypes, were driving the relationship](https://www.quora.com/What-were-popular-Greek-opinions-of-Rome-especially-before-the-Second-Punic-War-and-Rome’s-ascension-to-supwerpower-status). Rome was able to find many Greek allies who were more worried about Macedonian pretensions than Roman “barbarism.” In the [Second Macedonian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Macedonian_War), the public face of Roman intervention in Greece was [Titus Quinctius Flamininus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Quinctius_Flamininus), who charmed the Greeks with his polished manners and obvious love of Greek culture: when the war was ended and Flamininus proclaimed “freedom for the Greeks” and the dismantling of Macedonian garrisons at the Isthmian games in 196, he was feted and even offered divine honors in some cities.

However Roman victory in the [Third Macedonian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Macedonian_War) ( 171–168 ) set the stage for a reaction: the [Fourth Macedonian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Macedonian_War) ( 158–140) had strong undertones of an anti-Roman uprising. It segued directly into the [Achaean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaean_War) in 146, where anti-Roman reaction replaced all rational calculation — the Achaeans had no hope where the more powerful Macedonians had failed: the surviving account by the pro-Roman Greek historian Polybius is [a complex mix of pity and rage at the short-sightedness of the nationalist faction](https://www.quora.com/When-Romans-conquered-ancient-Greece-was-it-treated-as-barbarian-victory-against-civilized-society-akin-to-Mongol-conquest).

The Achaean war culminated in the Roman destruction of Corinth — an act of deliberate barbarism which firmly and finally put Greece under Roman control. Fortunately for the Greeks, Roman policy after 146 was generally fairly lenient. In particular, the Romans did a good job of co-opting Greek elites, who were allowed a great deal of latitude at home and also new political and economic opportunities in the broader Roman domain. The Greeks found it easier to spin their relationship with Rome as a partnership than as a foreign occupation . The Greek identification with Rome was so complete that Greeks remained, in their own words, “_[Rhomaioi](https://www.quora.com/During-the-Eastern-Roman-Reign-what-did-the-Greeks-call-themselves-and-their-language)_ _”_  right down to the 20th century.
