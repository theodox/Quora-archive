They did indeed. Using honey seems to predate the origins of civilization — hunter-gatherers collected honey back into the mesolithic and likely paleolithic period. Here’s a cave painting from Spain around 6000 BC showing a honey-gatherer.

It looks like the [Egypt is where beekeeping first became a part of settled agriculture](https://www.planetbee.org/planet-bee-blog//the-sacred-bee-bees-in-ancient-egypt#:~:text=Beekeeping%20has%20been%20practiced%20for,one%20on%20top%20of%20another.). The oldest archaeological evidence for systematic beekeeping from comes from the sun temple of the fifth dynasty pharaoh [Niuserre ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyuserre_Ini)in the 25th century BC.

Bees were very important in agriculturally-oriented Egypt. In fact [the hieroglyphs we conventionally translate as “dual king” or “king of upper and lower Egypt” were a sedge plant and a bee:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenomen_(Ancient_Egypt))

We’ve even [found a more or less intact Egyptian beehive from around 1300 BC with a few bits of mummified bee still inside.](https://egyptmanchester.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/beekeeping-in-ancient-egypt-and-today/)

Honey was extremely useful and popular in antiquity. It’s not just a sweetener and a foodstuff — it’s got important antiseptic properties, making it the most common ingredient in ancient medicine, and it’s also an excellent preservative. So beekeeping was a big business in antiquity — it spread from Egypt all over the ancient world (though it’s not clear whether or not beekeeping in India and China developed independently).

Beekeeping spread up to Asia Minor sometime after between 1000 and 2000 BC. The Anatolians seem to have bred a more docile and productive kind of bee — the Assyrians imported bees and honey from Anatolia before they were able to set up their own industry which became a valuable export to Assyria and the Levant. By at least 750 BC — but probably much earlier — the Phrygians were making a potent kind of mead: the tomb of the semi-legendary [king Midas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midas) included included a preserved feast with traces of both honey and an interesting honey-based “cocktail” that was revived as the [Midas Touch](https://www.dogfish.com/brewery/beer/midas-touch) about 20 years ago. Another reason for the popularity of Anatolian honey might be that [one version was actually hallucinogenic](https://modernfarmer.com/2014/09/strange-history-hallucinogenic-mad-honey/) — at different times both Greek and Roman armies had… interesting… days after helping themselves to Anatolian honey.

Eventually, the Greeks and Romans picked up beekeeping. Aristotle correctly recorded the colony structure of beehives — but he [notoriously insisted that the the big bees were “kings” rather than “queens”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207009943#:~:text=Aristotle%20recognised%20up%20to%20nine,no%20sting%20and%20is%20stupid%E2%80%9D.&text=He%20had%20observed%20bees%20swarming%20and%20following%20their%20'king'.). Roman writers had more practical advice, even if it was couched as poetry:

> Whenever you would unseal their noble home, and the honey
they keep in store, first bathe the entrance, moistening it
with a draught of water, and follow it with smoke held out
in your hand. Their anger knows no bounds, and when hurt
they suck venom into their stings, and leave their hidden lances
fixed in the vein, laying down their lives in the wound they make.

> [Virgil, Georgics IV](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/VirgilGeorgicsIV.php#anchor_Toc534524375)

So yes: ancient people were avid beekeepers, and honey has been a regular part of agriculture, cooking, and medicine for at least the last 5,000 years. You can catch up a lot more in this video from archaeologist and beekeeper Gil Stein:
