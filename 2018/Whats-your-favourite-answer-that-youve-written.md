This is a tough one. My inner Aristotle immediately wants to ask _“favorite for what end?”_ 

There are plenty of [pseudo-scholarly bits](https://www.quora.com/A-Quoran-archaeologist-historian-argues-there-is-no-textual-evidence-for-a-Christian-theological-tradition-in-the-West-prior-to-the-life-of-Alcuin-735-804-CE-and-that-earlier-Christian-history-is-a-fiction-Is-there/answer/Steve-Theodore?share=f82d439c&srid=zLvM), which tickle my old graduate school itches. There are also few[ lets-set-the-record-straight](https://www.quora.com/If-I-create-a-moderately-successful-AAA-game-will-I-become-a-millionaire/answer/Steve-Theodore?share=37474e5f&srid=zLvM) jobs that I like. There are a couple of [bits of real obscurantism](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-historical-fact-you-know-off-the-top-of-your-head/answer/Steve-Theodore?share=3532e59f&srid=zLvM) that I find particularly amusing.
