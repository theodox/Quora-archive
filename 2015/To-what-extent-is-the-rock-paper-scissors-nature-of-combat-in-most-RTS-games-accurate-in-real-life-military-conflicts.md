Not to a very great extent, it if at all. 

RPS is a basic design pattern that crops up in all sorts of games. It's really a way of taking a very difficult design problem:

_How can I make two different factions or units that play differently, but are easily balanced?_ 

into a much simpler one:

_If I make three units and A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A then I've already given each one a 50/50 chance!_ 

It's really hard to design asymmetrical gameplay that still feels balanced and allows both players to feel like they have a reasonable shot at winning. It's not impossible -- but it's extremely tricky. It's particularly bad for online games, where even a whiff of competitive advantage will encourage people to stampede to the 'winningest' side ( I remember in _Team Fortress Classic_  we had to eliminate even the most trivial cosmetic differences between the two halves of _Two Forts,_  because players convinced themselves that different lighting or textures gave one side or the other an edge). 

On the other a working RPS arrangement basically guarantees each unit or faction a 50-50 overall shot, since an overmatch against one opponent is balanced by a weakness against another.

That's why RPS is such a perennial : it makes designer's lives easier. It's definitely not the result of detailed historical research, although it's not unknown for designers to try to find plausible historical casting choices to fill the well-known RPS roles. Hardcore _grognards_  go for much more detailed analysis of the [Advanced Squad Leader](http://vasl.info/) variety, where all of the infinite variety of relative pros and cons are lovingly modeled -- balance and fun be damned.

The real-world analog to the RPS pattern is probably what's known as 'combined arms tactics' - the doctrine that different units are necessary to support each other in a variety of situations. This is a basic aspect of any military - from the escorts and submarines which accompany an aircraft carrier to the interlocking roles of armor, artillery, infantry, close air support and strategic air assets on the ground. However in practice that rarely resolves itself into a neat RPS pattern. Most real world forces are structured around a dominant arm (in the US, that's typically been heavy armor on land and aircraft carriers on the sea) with other types of forces used to support the major player and to compensate for its weaknesses: in an aircraft carrier battle group the carrier is the critical asset and most of the other ships and subs are primarily there to keep the enemy away from the carrier. That mix of forces will vary by situation and terrain -- armor is less dominant in cities, aircraft less valuable in areas with heavy forest cover, and so on --- but the relationships are anything but balanced.

This is also due to the stakes. A relative advantage is _much_  more important in real combat than on your PC. When the enemy is confronted by something they can't effectively counter, morale becomes increasingly shaky. The conviction that you don't have a chance is what really matters -- numbers and equipment and 'stats' only matter in so far as they contribute to that feeling. Smart militaries hate 'game balance' - they aim for the most lopsided, unfair, and un-fun (for the other guys) conflict imaginable.
