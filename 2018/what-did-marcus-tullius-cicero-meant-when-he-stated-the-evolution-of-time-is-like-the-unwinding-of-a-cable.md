Sounds like you want this:

> _Non enim illa, quae futura sunt, subito exsistunt, sed est quasi rudentis explicatio sic traductio temporis nihil novi efficientis et primum quidque replicantis._ 

> For those things, which are yet to be, do not suddenly come to be — like the uncoiling of a [rope] the pulling-forth of time is not the creation of anything new but the opening up of the first thing.

[De Divinatione, 1.127](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Cic.+Div.+1.127&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0033)

My translation is pretty clunky; Cicero here is trying to keep a foot in the language of Greek philosophy (the link includes an English version that’s more fluid). The key-words are _rudens,_ a strong rope or cable, along with _explico_ and _replico_ which both go back to the root word _plico_ , which is the verb for winding and folding. The image is of a rope being played out from a neat coil, one pleat at a time.

The quote comes from the [De Divinatione,](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Divinatione/1*.html) Cicero’s book which discusses (and then debunks) various positions regarding the Roman belief in dreams, prophecies and omens — an interesting choice coming from one of Rome’s [official augurs](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Augurium.html).*

The speaker here is Cicero’s brother Quintus, who takes up volume 1 of the book with his effort to defend the art of divination on a variety of grounds — he cites famous examples of prophecies fulfilled, but also (as here) rationalizing philosophical justifications for the ability of diviners to foretell the future.

Throughout book I most of Quintus’ line is a version of the way the Stoic school defended the idea of prophecy. Mainstream Stoicism had a very mechanistic view of the universe — “chance” was entirely absent, and all of the interplay of events was a deterministic playing out of prior causes. This “rope” of events is a Stoic metaphor very similar to what we call in English a “chain of causation.” The idea is that all these events are predetermined and simply revealed, one after another, without any element of chance or randomness or divine intervention. This strict causality provides the Stoics with a justification for omens and the like, since the future state of the universe is unambiguously encoded in its current state so that the watchful may be able to predict its outcomes.

Stoic philosophy was [always torn between the determinism implied in this view and the strong Stoic emphasis on the freedom of the will](http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/chrysippus/); sometimes the Stoics sound like hard determinists who allow no room for human freedom at all, but the central moral points of Stoicism are all about how one chooses to behave and to accept the workings of fate. This paradox was widely recognized by rival schols: as Cicero himself put it elsewhere (in _De Fato) "[The Stoic] Chrysippus, in spite of all efforts and labor, is perplexed how to explain that everything is ruled by fate, but that we nevertheless have some control over our conduct.”_ 

Cicero was a bit of a philosophical magpie, but he aligned himself most closely with what’s known as [Academic skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_skepticism) ( capital - A, because it’s aligned with the Academy of Athens). In the second book of_De Divinatione_  Cicero will (speaking as himself) offer a critique, based on his own skeptical Academic principles, which emphasize the impossibility of certainty in any knowledge — least of all knowledge of the future. However he also takes the opportunity to poke at the Stoic idea on purely theological grounds: _“Of what advantage to me is divination if everything is ruled by Fate?” (2.8)._ However his main point is negative; he spends most of the book poking fun at what he saw as the superstitions of the rabble. Cicero’s skepticism here allows him — as he often does — to stick largely to a negative argument without providing a strong positive counter; he himself is in an interesting position because he’s a committed defender of traditional Roman religion but he’s also concerned with purging it of the “superstitions of the rabble” (2.72).



* in book 2 he makes a point of quoting the elder Cato:

> _Vetus autem illud Catonis admodum scitum est, qui mirari se aiebat quod non rideret haruspex haruspicem cum vidisset_ 

> That old saying by Cato is quite well known; he said he was surprised that one haruspex [= reader of entrails] did not burst out laughing when he saw another one.
