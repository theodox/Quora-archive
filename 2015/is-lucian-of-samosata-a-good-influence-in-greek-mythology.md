Lucian was a satirist-- a kind of absurdist who specialized in sarcasm, irony and fantasy. He is sometimes regarded as the inventor of science fiction for his (very much invented) work https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_History 

 He was clearly well educated, and he wrote in a period when literary style often meant "showing off your education". He clearly imitates the style of other writers who liked to parade their knowledge of obscure traditions. However as a fantasist, he was comfortable inventing impressive sounding "facts" to make an elaborate joke. So,I would not rely on a solitary quote from Lucian as evidence of some kind of authentic tradition. 

For what it's worth he seems to have been an Assyrian, although his education and writing were Greek. One thing he may give insights into is an outsider's view of greco-roman mythology and literature.
