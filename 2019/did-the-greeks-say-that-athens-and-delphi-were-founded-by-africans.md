Not really, though — like most things ancient — there are some interesting bits of evidence to consider.

__Athens__ 

The traditional founder of Athens is [Cecrops](https://www.theoi.com/Heros/Kekrops.html), and he was always described as “born from the soil” (_autochthones)_ or “native” (_gegenes)._ The Athenians were very attached to the idea that they were and always had been the original inhabitants of Attica; unlike other cities in Greece with supposedly foreign founders the Athenians were generally insistent that they had always been in the same place. Herodotus identifies the Athenians as [Pelasgians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelasgians), which was a vague catch-all terms for the oldest inhabitants of the Greek peninsula.

There are however two ancient sources that do try to connect Athens with Egypt.

__Plato’s__  dialog [Timaeus](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/timaeus.html) has a character who says this (at 21 e):

> In the Egyptian Delta, at the head of which the river Nile divides, there is a certain district which is called the district of Sais, and the great city of the district is also called Sais, and is the city from which King Amasis came. The citizens have a deity for their foundress; she is called in the Egyptian tongue Neith, and is asserted by them to be the same whom the Hellenes call Athene; they are great lovers of the Athenians, and say that they are in some way related to them.

As evidence for Athenian descent from Egypt, however, this leaves a good bit to be desired: if you read the rest of the story it’s the prelude to the story of Atlantis, which the Egyptian priest relates two paragraphs later.

The other source is __Diodorus Siculus__ , a Sicilian Greek who was roughly contemporary with Julius Caesar. Diodorus quotes an (unnamed) Egyptian source describing Egypt’s rule over, essentially, the whole world in distant antiquity. For example around [Book I, chapter 29](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1A*.html):

> Moreover, certain of the rulers of Athens were originally Egyptians, they say. Petes, for instance, the father of that Menestheus who took part in the expedition against Troy, having clearly been an Egyptian, later obtained citizenship at Athens and the kingship. [missing in the text, but probably “Cecrops”] was of double form, and yet the Athenians are unable from their own point of view to give the true explanation of this nature of his, although it is patent to all that it was because of his double citizenship, Greek and barbarian, that he was held to be of double form, that is, part animal and part man.

However it’s important to note that he’s not necessarily buying what his Egyptian sources say. In the introduction to his book (I.8) he writes:

> with respect to the antiquity of the human race, not only do Greeks put forth their claims but many of the barbarians as well, all holding that it is they who were sprung from the soil and the first of all men to discover the things which are of use in life, and that it was the events in their own history which were the earliest to have been held worthy of record. So far as we are concerned, however, we shall not make the attempt to determine with precision the antiquity of each nation or what is the race whose nations are prior in point of time to the rest and by how many years, but we shall record summarily, keeping due proportion in our account, what each nation has to say concerning its antiquity and the early events in its history.

So — it’s absolutely true that some people in antiquity believed that the Athenians were ultimately Egyptians.

However if you’ll notice in both accounts its an Egyptian, not a Greek making the claim — Egypt lost its political independence in 525 BC and both of these quotes comes from times when Egyptians were eager to assert their cultural prestige because they didn’t have military or economic clout to fall back on.

__Delphi__ 

Delphi’s origin myth is not about people; it’s about how the god Apollo slew a powerful serpent named Python took control of the oracle, which until then had been the property of Gaia the earth goddess (snakes are commonly associated with Gaia in Greek myths).

As far as ethnic connections go, one late source does say that it was the “Hyperboreans” who came to Delphi after Apollo’s conquest to establish the oracle. Hyperboreans were the legendary inhabitants of the uttermost north — the name means “beyond the North wind.” So it’s unlikely they are Africans. In practice it’s far more likely that any foreign influence in Delphi comes from the east, rather than the south. Apollo, the god of Delphi, is often connected with traditions from Asia Minor, his human mother, Leto, came from the kingdom of Lydia and in historic times we know that the Lydian king Croesus was a generous patron of Apollo’s oracle at Delphi.
