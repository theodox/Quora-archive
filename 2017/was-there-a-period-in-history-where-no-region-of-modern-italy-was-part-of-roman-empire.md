The western empire before 476 was always in possession of _some_ part of modern Italy, even though there were many usurpations and civil wars during which definition of “Roman” was debatable. Even while the Goths were besieging Rome the imperial power (such as it was) was headquartered in Ravenna. During the Vandal sack the Vandals were technically allied with one of two contending Roman factions (nominally at least the Vandals were there to “rescue” empress [Licinia Eudoxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licinia_Eudoxia)). Sicily, Sardinia and northern Italy remained Roman even when the Goths and Vandals were marching through the peninsula.

You could make a case on paper that [Odoacer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer) (476–493) and [Theoderic the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoderic_the_Great) (475- 526) both held Roman titles while they ruled Italy, but it would be mostly a legal fiction. In any case, after Theoderic’s death the fiction wore very thin, and between 526 and 535 only a very naive reading with have Italy under “Roman” control, even though the pretense was maintained at great expense:

Clearly emperor Justinian agreed that Italy was no longer “Roman”, which is why he invaded the peninsula in 535. The [Exarchate of Ravenna ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exarchate_of_Ravenna)was the main toehold of the (Byzantine) Romans on the Italian peninsula; its size fluctuated with the fortunes of war but it lasted until 751 when it finally fell to the Lombards, leaving Sicily as the main “Roman” possession in modern Italy. The Byzantines lost Siciy to the Arabs from 962 to 1038, but they [recaptured most of southern Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catepanate_of_Italy) starting in 873. The final end of “Rome” in modern Italy would then be the fall of southern Italy to the Normans in 1071, so the interval from 1071 to 1453 would be “post-Roman” Italy.

TLDR — 476 to 535 (with some legal quibbles) and then 1071 to 1453.
