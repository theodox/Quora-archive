_Sticking entirely to WWII aircraft for maximum metaphorical precision._ 

__C++ is the__ __[B-26 Marauder](http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/flying-and-fighting-in-the-b-26-marauder/)__ , a powerful and effective warplane with the unfortunate habit of killing its crews in accidents, particularly if they were not rigorously trained.

__C# is the__ __[C-47](http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=111)__ . It’s not exactly a weapon — it’s a cargo plane. But it’s a workhorse that gets its humble job done reliably in adverse conditions. And it can be pressed into service as a gunship. Won’t win any dogfights, but will win the war.

__Java is the__ __[JU-52](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_52)__  — the German counterpart to the C47. It has many of the same virtues as the C47/C#… it’s just uglier and clunkier. On the other hand, can be fitted with skis (Scala and Groovy)

__Python its the__ __[DeHavilland Mosquito](http://www.historyandheadlines.com/the-de-havilland-mosquito-britains-super-plane-of-wwii/)__ , the “wooden wonder” — a remarkably versatile platform… but made out of pressed plywood in a sky full of sleek aluminum airframes. It can be adapted to almost anything — just not as fast as the competition.

__C is the__ __[Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_A6M_Zero)__ __…__ In the right hands it’s deadly, but it’s hard to find anyone who can fly it to its full potential; it’s lack of protection for the pilot can be a fatal weakness

__Assembly is the__ __[Messerschmitt Me 263](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_263)__ ____ — no mere jet, but a freaking _rocket_  fighter. Unfortunately it was nearly impossible to deploy in combat. Incredibly dangerous… but it doesn’t even have landing gear: you have to skid to the ground.

__Javascript is the__ __[Stuka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_87)__ __.__  Highly touted by the propaganda machine, but verging on obsolescence. Equipped with a deafening siren (UI!) it has tremendous morale impact…. but it’s a dead duck against a prepared enemy (or the removal of a 3-line module from npm). It’s constantly screaming directly toward ground at high speed.

__Perl is the__ ___[Ohka](https://acesflyinghigh.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/yokosuka-mxy7-ohka-the-height-of-kamikaze-madness-in-1945/)___ ____ — Japan’s only operational jet. Sophisticated in it s own way, but designed for only a one-way trip. The allied code for it, “Baka,” is Japanese for “crazy”

It’s hard to know about __Swift__ . Right now I incline to think its like the [F7F Tigercat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumman_F7F_Tigercat), the [P-61 Black Widow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_P-61_Black_Widow), or the [P-80 Shooting Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_P-80_Shooting_Star) — brilliant, sophisticated aircraft that arrived too late to impact the outcome of the war. But maybe it will turn out to be a best-in-breed classic, like the P-51 Mustang or the FW-190.

And __Rust__  is like one of those German Wunderwaffen from the drawing boards: ahead of its time. The question is whether it’s truly visionary, like the [Arado Flying Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arado_E.555)

… or just goofy, like the [Triebflügel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Triebfl%C3%BCgel)
