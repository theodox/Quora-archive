Plutarch’s _[Sayings of the Spartans](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/moralia/sayings_of_spartans*/main.html)_  is the classic source. Not all of the quotes age very well (some are Greek wordplay, which is hard to translate) but here’s ca couple:

> Once upon a time the Ephors said to Agis the son of Archidamus, "Take the young men and march against the country of this man here. He will himself guide you to its citadel." "And how, sirs," said Agis, "is it right to entrust so many youths to a man who is betraying his own country?"

> He said that the Spartans did not ask 'how many are the enemy,' but 'where are they?'

> When, at Mantineia, he was not permitted to risk a decisive battle with the enemy, who outnumbered his men, he said, "He who would rule over many must fight with many."

> Androcleidas the Spartan, who had a crippled leg, enrolled himself among the fighting-men. And when some persons were insistent that he be not accepted because he was crippled, he said, "But I do not have to run away, but to stay where I am when I fight the opposing foe."

> [Antalcidas] used to say that the young men were the walls of Sparta, and the points of their spears its boundaries.

> In answer to the man who sought to know why the Spartans use short daggers in war, he said, "Because we fight close to the enemy."

> Bias, caught in an ambush by Iphicrates the Athenian general, and asked by his soldiers what was to be done, said, "What else except for you to save your lives and for me to die fighting?"

> Cleomenes, the son of Cleombrotus, when someone offered him fighting cocks and said that they would die fighting for victory, said, "Well then, give me some of those that kill them, for those are better than these."

> When someone said, "Because of the arrows of the barbarians it is impossible to see the sun," [Leonidas] said, "Won't it be nice, then, if we shall have shade in which to fight them?"

> A Spartan had as an emblem on his shield a fly, and that, too, no bigger than life-size. When some mockingly said that he had done this to escape being noticed, he said, "Rather that I may be noticeable; for I come so close to the enemy that my emblem is seen by them in its true size."
