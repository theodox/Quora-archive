Not quite as different as you think; Blender is extensible with Python in much the same way Maya is: [Blender Python API](https://docs.blender.org/api/2.78b/)

Generally I’d try to learn one and then the other — both are big complex systems that can consume all your attention if you let them — but they make a good pairing if you’re interested in technical art.
