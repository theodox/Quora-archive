The 'census' isn't actually recorded: the original text just says 

απογραφεσθαι πασαν την οικουμενην , "that all the world be enrolled"

where απογραφεσθαι means something like 'to be enrolled' or 'to be recorded' : It is used elsewhere to mean 'to register for the census' but also for other bureaucratic impositions: for example, Josephus records that Augustus demanded a loyalty oath from Judaeans shortly before Herod's death which would be an idiomatic use of απογραφεσθαι. 

As for forcing people to move around: it's more or less guesswork however you look at it, although many governments require people to maintain a 'legal residence' which is not where they actually live: the modern Chinese [Hukou system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system) does exactly this for tens of millions of people who 'reside' nowhere near where they actually live -- and usually get screwed on government benefits and legal rights because of it.
