None of these is primarily an ethnic group; this was a part of the world that was always multiethnic. __Mesopotamians__  is a geographic term; there were a lot of ethnic groups in Mesopotamia, from famous ones like Sumerians and Assyrians to more obscure ones like the Gutians and Amorites.

__Akkadian__  was a language grouping rather than an ethnic identity__.__ It was an east Semitic language which gradually edged out Sumerian as the dominant language of Mesopotamia. It also spread through the conquest — many Akkadian speakers will have been ethnic Sumerians or members of the many other groups who were subjugated by Sargon of Akkad and his successors in the Akkadian empire. The language and the empire take their names from the city of Akkad. You can think of Akkadian as similar to “Latin” - it denotes language and a culture but not a nation. And like Latin Akkadian became part of the cultural heritage of more than one successor group.

The __Babylonian__  language is essentially a dialect of Akkadian, Assyrian is also a dialect of Akkadian. Although Babylonians and Assyrians were rivals and quite culturally distinct from each other, their languages were more or less mutually intelligible. They both tried to portray themselves as heirs of the prestigious culture of the both the first Akkadian empire and of the Sumerians.

Like Akkadian speakers. Babylonians were not precisely an ethnic group — or at least, they took a long time to become one. Babylon itself was founded by an Amorite dynasty (Hammurabi, one of the most famous Babylonians, was an Amorite).. The Amorite dynasty in Babylon was succeeded by another foreign ruling house, the Kassites, The Babylonian state eventually assimilated the Chaldaeans, who spoke a West Semitic language. So, the Babylonian kingdoms were originally multiethnic. By the Iron Age however Babylonian culture was distinctive enough that it probably makes sense to think of them as an ethnic group.
