# Why did Alexander the Great get the title "Setepenre-meryamun" from historians because he managed to conquer Egypt but this title was not given to even a single Persian king who succeeded in conquering Egypt?

Some of the Persian “Pharaohs” did actually get regnal names in the traditional Egyptian style. For example Darius I used the [Horus Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus_name)

> _Menekh ib,_ “One splendid of mind”

and the [throne name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenomen_(Ancient_Egypt))

> _Setut Ra_ Progeny of Ra

( translations from [Pharaoh.se](https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Darius-I)) We don’t have these for all Persian emperors, but even the very unpopular Cambyses has at least a few Egyptian titles, such as _Mesut Ra,_ “The offspring of Ra”. Even though Persian rule was generally not well-loved by native Egyptians, the Persian emperors seem to have tried to follow Egyptian forms and protocols in dealing with their Egyptian subjects. They were however less generous to the Egyptian temples than the native pharaohs had been, so examples are comparatively rare.

Alexander, on the other hand, [went out of his way to conciliate Egyptian popular opinion](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised). Part of that was a partnership with the Egyptian religious authorities, who helped to portray him in true pharaonic style. This was more than just good will: for example the choice of the throne name

> _Setep en Ra,_  _mery Amun_ Chosen by Ra and beloved of Amun

is a very political one: The last native Pharaoh, Nectanebo II, used

> _Senedjem ib Ra_ , _setep en Amun_ Pleasing to the Heart is Ra, chosen of Amun

Alexander was deliberately echoing Nectanebo’s throne name with a slight twist: he did, after all, proclaim himself to be the son of Amun. The Egyptian temples, happy to support the man who had ejected the hated Persians, were willing to back that claim. His Horus name was

> _Mek Kemet_ Guardian of Egypt

just in case the message was lost on anyone.

The Ptolemaic dynasty continued to use Egyptian nomenclature (at least, in their Egyptian-language documents and inscriptions) down to the time of Cleopatra. [The Roman emperors did so as well](https://www.quora.com/After-the-death-of-Cleopatra-did-the-title-of-pharaoh-become-associated-with-Roman-emperors-How-did-the-Romans-reconcile-the-principate-emperors-with-the-position-of-a-foreign-king/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=77aa535d&srid=zLvM), at least down to the time of Domitian (81–96), who was

> _Hor sa Aset mery netjeru nebu_  
Horus, son of Isis, beloved of the gods

It’s likely that the tradition faded out rather than ending abruptly, but I don’t think we have any later examples: after the first century, Roman emperor cartouches use transcriptions of Latin or Greek titles.
