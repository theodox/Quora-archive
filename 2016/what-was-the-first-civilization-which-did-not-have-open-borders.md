Immigration controls are very old. However, given the fragmentary nature of our evidence, it’s not possible to get very close to a definitive time.

As far as hard evidence goes:

This is the a drawing of two stelae set up by [Senwosret III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senusret_III). The right hand panel, which dates form 1870 BC, says:

> Southern boundary, made in year 8 under the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Khakaure, given life forever until eternity, to prevent that any Nubian should cross it, by sailing north or by land, with a ship, or any herds of the Nubians apart from a Nubian who shall come to trade in Mirgissa, or with a message, or anything good that may be done with them, but without letting a ship of the Nubians pass that sails north past Abu Sir, forever.

However it’s extremely unlikely that this is actually the first instance of a national border. Around the same time, we know that the Assyrians maintained [permanent trading posts](http://smie.co/html/cultural_history/assyrian_colonies/assyrian_colonies.shtml), known as _karum_ , in foreign lands —which might mean that the Assyrians were clannish but could equally well be another example of the ‘foreign concession’ style of restricted immigration on the part of the hosts: we do know that in historic times, the Egyptians maintained a similar expatriate colony for Greeks at [Naucratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naucratis).

Most ancient societies were extremely complex: economic power and social mobility were heavily tied to birth. People still moved around, but the modern idea of picking up stakes to start life anew somewhere else was, at best, an option for the very fortunate: the few who could afford to engage in international trade.

The main ‘working class’ exceptions would be refugees — people fleeing some disaster. In a world without either an open labor market or a welfare state, they frequently ended up as slaves: In Akkadian, the word for “foreigner,” _munnabittu,_ is also the word for “refugee”…. and for a class of unfree laborer.

Another, very different type of migrants were nomadic pastoralists who interacted with a number of settled neighbors as they followed their usual route. That form of migration, though, was famously fraught with conflicts: to pick one example of many, the incursions of the pastoralist [Amorites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorites) into Sumeria in the the 21st century BC were a historical trauma of a high order with endemic violence and social upheaval. Eventually the Sumerians tried to keep them out by [building a great wall between the Tigris and the Euphrates.](http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/7-famous-border-walls)

For the record, it didn’t work.
