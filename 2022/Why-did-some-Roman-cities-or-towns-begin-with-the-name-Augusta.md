It’s a fragment of a longer name, usually in the form _colonia augusta [some-ethnic-identifier-here]._ 

Originally _colonia_ were settlements of Roman veterans, and the got their names from local geography or ethnic names — so for example the port city we know as Ostia was, municipally, __colonia Ostiensis__ __ “the doorway colony.” During the later Republic, as the creation of colonies became a very important part of the political relationship between Roman warlords and their soldiers, it became common to insert the name of the general as a tribute to the founder: Caesar’s colony in todays Vienne, France was __colonia Julia Viennensium__ _, “the Julian colony of the Viennenses.”_ 

The _Augusta_ tag comes from the same impulse. Later emperors would substitute their own clan names — there are places like __Colonia Claudia Victricensis,__ “the Claudian colony of [his] Victory” (Colchester) and __Colonia Septimia Severa Tyrus,__ “the Septimio-Severan colony Tyre”.

As time went on the status of a colony became a somewhat prestigious municipal honor, and it became quite common to “found a colony” without laying a single new brick by simply granting rights and privileges and a suitable Roman form of municipal government to existing cities. Sometimes there was a physical takeover of an existing city: Pompeii was technically __Colonia Cornelia Veneria Pompeianorum,__ “The Cornelian colony dedicated to Venus of the Pompeiians”, and there you can see evidence of old landowners and institutions being dispossessed. But often — especially in the later imperial period — the change was purely honorary, marking an imperial visit or maybe a reward for some local dignitary — Vienne was renamed, under Augustus, to __Colonia Julia Augusta Florentia Vienna,__ “the Flourishing Julian-Augustan colony Vienna”, and age-old Beirut became __Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Berytus,__ “the Fortunate Julian-Augustan colony of Beirut.”

It could have been worse: Timgad in Algeria was officially __Colonia Marciana Ulpia Traiana Thamugadi,__ because its title name checked Trajan, his mother Marcia, and his father Ulpius Traianus. You can see why the locals stuck with “Timgad.” Herod’s city of Caesarea wins the suck-up Olympics as __Colonia Prima Flavia Augusta Caesarea Felix Concordia Metropolis Syriae Palestinae,__ “the blessed first Flavian-Augustan Colony of Caesarea, dedicated to harmony, mother-city of Syria and Palestine.” This reflects the fact that by the time it wore that title (circa 220), Roman troops had levelled old Jerusalem and built __Colonia Aelia Capitolina,__ “The Aelian Colony dedicated to Capitoline Jupiter” on top of it and Caesarea was proud of still having two stones stacked on top of each other.

There are ton of other city names which follow this pattern. Since these offical titles were such a mouthful of bureaucratese, few of them actually retained “Augusta” or other dedication names in ordinary usage — if nothing else, that kind of verbiage was so common that there might well be another city or two in the same province with the same prefix. An example of one that did survive is Zaragoza, Spain, originally __Colonia Caesaraugusta.__ 

On the other hand in a while the locals really got it wrong: Köln, aka. Cologne, is properly __Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium,__ “The Claudian colony at the shrine of the Aggrippians” but only the “colony” part stuck.
