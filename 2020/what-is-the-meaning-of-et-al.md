It’s the Latin phrase _et alii_ , literally “and others”, where its usually understood that the others are other people. It’s commonly used in academic writing to indicated that several people contributed to something without listing them all. For example if several writers contributed to a book, it might be cited as “Smith et al. 2000” to indicate that Smith was the lead author but there were others as well.

In older writing _et al_ could also be the slightly different Latin _et alia_ , “and other _things_ ” and could be used for general list-shortening. Nowadays most people use _etc._ or _et cetera,_ which is “and the rest” or “and so on” in this case.
