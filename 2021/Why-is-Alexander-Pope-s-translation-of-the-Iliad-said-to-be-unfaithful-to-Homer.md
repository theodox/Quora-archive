Ah, but said by whom?

Samuel Johnson called it

> certainly the noblest version of poetry which the world has ever seen, and its publication must therefore be considered as one of the great events in the annals of learning.

His approbation was widely shared in the 18th century — even though Pope’s translation had contemporary rivals it quickly outshone them all. Pope was a controversial figure and had many detractors, but in the end his Iliad was the most popular translation of the century (his Odyssey, which included two co-authors, was less successful though still popular). Nevertheless, accusations of wandering from the strict sense of the original are hardly new: Edward Gibbon called Pope’s Iliad “a portrait endowed with every merit save faithfulness to the original.” Or as the classicists Richard Bentley told him, “It is a pretty poem, Mr Pope, but you must not call it Homer.”

Actually, Pope was very much aware of the tension between staying true to the Homer’s words and to Homer’s sense at the same time. In his preface, for example, Pope chides his predecessor [Chapman](http://johnstoniatexts.x10host.com/homer/chapmaniliad.htm):

> Chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent interpolations of four or six lines, and I remember one in the thirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty verses out of two.

and more cuttingly

> He is often mistaken in so bold a manner that one might think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifle

Of course — as the author of the [Dunciad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dunciad), a mock-epic send-up of British poets, Pope was not famous for charity towards literary rivals. Still: he clearly took his task seriously. His own ambitions are laid out in the preface quite clearly, if perhaps at too great a length:

> That which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of anyone who translates Homer, is__above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character__  : in particular places, where the sense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as most agreeing with that character ; to copy him in all the variations of his style, and the different modulations of his numbers ; to preserve, in the more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation ; in the more sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity ; in the speeches, a fulness and perspicuity ; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity : not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor sometimes the very cast of the periods ; neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of antiquity : perhaps, too, he ought to conclude the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any translator

This is a long list of goals, and one which involves a complex balancing act between many competing goods. Pope’s ultimate goal, however, is clear: capturing the _spirit_  of the Iliad rather than its letter. Though he values the “little figures and turns of words” and wants “to copy him in all the variations of his style” Pope’s chief goal is to embody what he sees as the essential dramatic quality of the original in an English medium.

One reason this might be hard for us to notice is that Pope also cared deeply for “this different modulations of his numbers,” which is to say, for Homer’s use of meter, rhythm, and assonance. Pope and Homer were, in this sense, much closer to each other than either of them is to us: most modern English readers are so unused to strict schemes of rhyme and meter that we often miss the musical and dramatic effects which Pope’s original audience reveled in (for a great, sympathetic discussion of this see [Garry Will’s review of a 1997 edition of Pope’s Iliad in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/01/books/on-reading-pope-s-homer.html)). We’re so unused to the artificialities of poetic diction that to us it often feels forced and stagey — but Homer’s Greek is equally and self-consciously elevated and formal.



Pope’s twin ambitions — to capture both the soul of the original and to transpose its music and timbre into English — produce a very complicated translation. English poetic conventions sometimes oblige Pope to tinker with bare Homeric facts in order to complete his meter or to cap a rhyme. More importantly, his intuition about the essential drama of the Iliad sometimes leads him to add touches of his own to enhance what he sees as the essence of Homer’s story. Both the metrical requirements and Pope’s editorial interventions are usually subtle — he never follows Chapman in spinning twenty lines from two — but they do mean that you can’t always assume that a given word in Pope is present in Homer.

To illustrate the nature and scope of Pope’s alterations, here’s a [modern translation ](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Iliad18.php#anchor_Toc239246220)(by A.S. Kline) of how Achilles reacted to the news of Patroclus’s death in book 18, lines 22 and following:

> At these words, a black cloud of grief shrouded Achilles. Grasping handfuls of dark sand and ash, he poured them over his head and handsome face, soiling his scented tunic. Then he flung himself in the dust, and lying there outstretched, a fallen giant, tore and fouled his hair. The slave girls he and Patroclus had seized as prizes, shrieked with alarm, and ran to warlike Achilles, beating their breasts and sinking to the ground beside him. Antilochus, weeping and groaning, grasped Achilles’ hand, fearing he might take his knife and cut his own throat, so heart-felt was his noble grief.

Here’s Pope, with words that really aren’t in the Greek highlighted.

> A sudden horror shot through all the __chief__ ,
And wrapp’d __his senses__  in the cloud of grief;
Cast on the ground, with __furious__ hands he spread
The __scorching__ ashes o’er his graceful head;
His __purple__ garments, and his __golden__ hairs__,__ Those he deforms with dust, and these he tears;
On the hard soil his __groaning__ breast he threw,
And roll’d and grovell’d, as to earth he __grew__ .
The __virgin__ captives, with disorder’d charms,
(Won by his own, or by Patroclus’ arms,)
Rush’d from their tents with cries; and gathering round,
Beat their __white__ breasts, and _fainted on the ground:_ While _Nestor’s son sustains a manlier part_ ,
And mourns the warrior with a warrior’s heart;
_Hangs on his arms_ , amidst his frantic woe,
And__oft__  prevents the __meditated__ blow.

For the most part these changes don’t really affect the sense of what’s being said. Thus “chief” is only there as an easy bookend to “grief” — the kind of additions that that any pop lyricist might add to postpone a beat or fill out a line. This is one way Pope earns his reputation for “infidelity”: as the many highlights here show, he’s happy to add a word here or there to move the poetry along. You wouldn’t want to hang a key thesis statement in your term paper on, say, the whiteness of those virgin breasts since neither “white” nor “virgin” is present in the original Greek.

It is however worth noting that this is not just sloppiness or inattention to detail. Pope’s inserts are carefully chosen for effect — and his primary effect is _intensification._ He was writing in the seventeen-teens, as the baroque was accelerating on its way to the rococo — an aesthetic which the Wikipedia page describes as “crowded, dense, overlapping, loaded, in order to provoke shock effects.”

Crowded, dense, overlapping shock effects are where Pope’s genius tends to run. Here’s a prosaic line-by-line of the first bit

> ἀμφοτέρῃσι δὲ χερσὶν ἑλὼν κόνιν αἰθαλόεσσαν
In either hand grabbing the sooty dust

> χεύατο κὰκ κεφαλῆς, χαρίεν δ᾽ ᾔσχυνε πρόσωπον:
he poured (it) down on (his) head, grimed his beautiful face

> νεκταρέῳ δὲ χιτῶνι μέλαιν᾽ ἀμφίζανε τέφρη.
and covered (his) perfumed chiton with dark ashes

What you can see in Pope’s version — if you look past the regularity of the music in the lines and they formality of the diction — is that his additions are all dramatizations of the original: they add color (the purple chiton, the golden hair) and violence (the ashes are scorching, not sooty). They add to the pathos and the show; they are operatic amplifications of the original language. And — like opera — they work well in moments of intensity. But in more straightforward descriptive passages the effect can be a bit more _opéra bouffe._ 

The only significant change of _sense_ that Pope introduces in this bit is also indicative. In the original:

> Ἀντίλοχος δ᾽ ἑτέρωθεν ὀδύρετο δάκρυα λείβων
Antilochus from the other side lamented and poured out tears

> χεῖρας ἔχων Ἀχιλῆος: ὃ δ᾽ ἔστενε κυδάλιμον κῆρ:
holding Achilles’ hands: his glorious heart groaned for

> δείδιε γὰρ μὴ λαιμὸν ἀπαμήσειε σιδήρῳ.
(Antilochus) feared lest (Achilles) would cut his throat with the iron

Pope preserves the action but with a telling change. At this point in the original, Achilles ought to be face down on the ground (“on the hard soil his groaning breast he threw”) but Pope has him up again (“hangs on his arms” makes no sense if Achilles is prone!). In the original the slave-girls “knees gave out beneath them”, but Pope has them faint like good eighteenth century stage heroines. Pope has reimagined the moment in an eminently theatrical rococo manner: the contrast of the prone female forms and the struggling upright male ones is a familiar period trope in theater and painting:

To drive home the point Pope calls Antilochus’s intervention “manlier.” This certainly recalls the gender conventions of the 18th century stage but it also invokes a little musical set piece; the ___manlier___ _part / and_ ___mourns___ _the_ ___warrior___ _with the_ ___warrior’s___ _heart.”_ By inserting _oft_ in the next line, Pope turns Homer’s static image into a struggle, heightening the tension. Again, this is classic baroque tensioning.



To _finally_  answer the original question — a payoff as delayed as any convoluted Popeian simile splayed across half a dozen lines! — it’s Pope’s marriage of tight poetic constraints and subtle dramatic highlights which gives his Iliad it’s unique flavor. If your primary value in a translation is close adherence to the original text in a different language then Pope is not your man. But he’s quite clear that his intentions transcend literalism:

> It is certain no literal Translation can be just to an excellent Original in a superior Language: but it is a great Mistake to imagine that a rash Paraphrase can make amends for this general Defect. The author knows no Liberties one ought to take, but those which are necessary for transfusing the Spirit of the Original, and supporting the Poetical Style of the Translation

If, on the other hand, your want to spend time with a gifted poet who devoted several years of his life to bring his own disciplined and deeply considered reflections on a fellow bard to life… well then you could do a lot worse.



For a much more detailed critique of Pope’s method (and the problem of translating Homer generally) you could likewise do worse than Mathew Arnold’s _On Translating Homer._ I think Arnold over-values the “plain naturalness of Homer” (this was, after all, half a century before Milman Parry and the modern approach to oral traditions) but it’s still a very strong and well informed take which recognizes Pope’s strengths without excusing his more overblown flights of verbiage..
