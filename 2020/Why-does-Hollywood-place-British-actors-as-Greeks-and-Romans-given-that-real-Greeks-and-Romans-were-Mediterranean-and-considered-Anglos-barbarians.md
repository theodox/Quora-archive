# Why does Hollywood place British actors as Greeks and Romans, given that real Greeks and Romans were Mediterranean and considered Anglos barbarians?

You mean British actors like this guy?

_David Gyasi as Achilles in the BBC’s_ “Troy”

Casting is occupies a weird realm where art, politics and economics collide. It’s extremely hard to know what really motivates a particular casting choice — it might be a director’s personal way of envisioning a character, or it might be that a given star’s presence is expected to generate a lot of ticket sales. It might be that somebody’s trying to score points by casting a non-traditional actor, or it might be that somebody is trying to play it safe by casting someone who did well in a similar role. Plenty of casting is simply done based on the availability of actors in a local market — just look at the relatively small rotating cast of European actors who work in Japan or China. You can have suspicions about somebody’s “real” motive for a particular casting choice but it’s unlikely you’ll ever really know.

A minor irony in this particular case is that quite often complaints about “anglo” casting in Greco-Roman settings are based on lack of familiarity with the sources. As it happens Achilles is supposed to be a blonde ; Brad Pitt is not just a more “visually correct” casting choice than David Gyasi to play Achilles, he’s also closer than, say, the eminently Greek but hairless Telly Savalas. But how close is “close enough?” People in the 19th century claimed to be able to distinguish a “mediterranean race” from a “nordic race” but most of that is just old-fashioned hooey on the same order as phrenology or palm reading. I’m half-Greek and I certainly can’t reliably tell if somebody’s Greek just by looking at them (my Dad, incidentally, was blonde as a child, though his hair darkened as he got older).

Telly Savalas, incidentally, was famously _furious_  that Anthony Quinn (Irish-Mexican) got the title role in _Zorba the Greek._  Savalas devoted tremendous energy, therefore, to landing the title role in _Pancho Villa_ ahead of Quinn. A perfect illustration of the vagaries of casting in the real world.

_Revenge casting at its finest (and least convincing)_ 

Sure, an ethnically Greek actor might make a great Achilles — but an ethnically Greek actor might also happen to be the grandson of emigres from Asia Minor, and thus actually be better cast as a _Trojan_  than as a Greek. Lacking photographic reference or even detailed visual descriptions of individuals it’s quite hard to know. How close, after all, is close enough? Armand Assante _looks_  pretty “mediterranean” as Odysseus — but he’s actually half Irish and half Italian (and 0% Greek). Moreover Odysseus is described in the _Odyssey_  as _melanchroes_ , “swarthy” — the same word that Greeks used for Egyptians and Syrians: Homer thought of Odysseus as markedly darker than most Achaeans. Maybe it would have been better to use Omar Sharif? And how — if we’re going that route — did Omar Sharif end up as _Doctor Zhivago_  anyway? The universe of ethnically imprecise casting is infinite.

_Richard Burton as Alexander the Great. His wig is correct, but much of the rest is off — like Achilles, Alexander was fair haired but Burton was not. Burton’s also too old (he was 31 when the movie was made, but the Alexander in this scene at Persepolis he was only 24)._ 

But in any case visual accuracy isn’t the only thing casting directors care about.

_Hamilton_  would not be _Hamilton_  with accurate, period-appropriate casting. We know what Hamilton, Washington et al looked like — and it wasn’t like that. But the whole show is about a certain vision of how America can work and the casting choices support that vision admirably.

Not all casting is that artistically valid — whether chasing after box-office dollars or chasing after likes from the woke wing of twitter or (worst of all) ginning up a phony controversy to score free advertising, there are lots of ways for a casting choice to deviate from historical precision. But it’s very hard to tell the honest failures from the cynical manipulations, or idiosyncratic but genuine direction from ignorance or self-indulgence. That’s commercial art for you — it’s a tangle of motives that can’t truly be picked apart.

Everybody should feel free to bitch about the choices that rub them the wrong way — but attaching some larger importance to what’s ultimately a personal preference (yours on the one hand and the casting director’s on the other) isn’t a good use of anyone’s time. [It’s particularly irritating when people get huffy about it without doing the homework.](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-inappropriate-for-a-white-actress-to-play-Cleopatra-since-she-was-Egyptian/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=73e98f4e&srid=zLvM) I
