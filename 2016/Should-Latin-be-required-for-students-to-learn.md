While I get a huge kick out of it and I firmly believe that it’s got great value, I don’t think making it mandatory is a good idea. There are few occupations where it makes professional sense — if you’re going to be a historian of Europe before the 19th century, it’s hard to do your job well without the ability to look at primary sources in Latin — but for pretty much everybody else it’s an avocation rather than a necessity.

In general, I feel like the world has gotten far too interested in making things mandatory — often to the point of rendering them absurd. Forcing kids to recite _amo, amas, amat_  won’t give kids an appreciation for the history and culture that goes with the grammar any more than forcing them to go to chapel used to make them holy.

I will say, though, that it’s a shame that so many American schools don’t offer it as an elective or an alternative to modern languages.
