There are examples of both Greek written in Latin characters for Latin audiences and Latin written in Greek characters for Greek audiences.

For the specific case of Greek writing Latin we have several examples of (bits and pieces of) bilingual dictionaries for language learners with Latin words in one column and Greek transliterations in another — this this not only clues us in to the use of different characters but also to the way Latin sounded to Greek ears. Some of these are really straight forward. so _militia_  becomes μιλιτια while others are more revealing: _equites_  becomes _εκουεττης —_ suggesting a long final e and a hard ‘t’ sound but _feliciter_  becomes φιλικιτερ_,_ with s short initial e transmuted into an i.

We can’t be completely sure when these differences are revealing a real difference from our reconstructed pronunciations and when they are just mis-spellings or regionalisms in the sources, but they are interesting.

The most common examples of transliterations are proper names, which we see very often in both directions.

_This example - from Delos - includes a transliterated names, though the verbs are in Greek and Latin_
