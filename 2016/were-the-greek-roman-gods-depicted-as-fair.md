Actually it's a surprisingly complex answer. The generic answer is that the Greek gods looked more or less like the Greeks themselves — which is to say they were more or less like modern Greeks, including a mix people we’d classify as ‘European’ and ‘Mediterranean’.

There’s not necessarily a single answer anyway. Most Greek deities had a complex mix of attributes arising from different, unconnected local traditions: the traditional imagery of one city might not accord with the next. The Greeks also had the habit of assigning their own familiar god-names to the characters of other peoples’ religions. This meant that stories attached to non-Greek sources often crept into Greek tradition via reverse osmosis: The Greeks decide that [Melqart](http://www.ancient.eu/Melqart/) is just the Phoenician name for Heracles… and in a few generations they don’t raise an eyebrow about several the famous labors of Heracles being set in Phoenician locales like the Atlas mountains or Gibraltar.

All of which means that the same name might be attached to a wildly inconsistent set of traits.

A few things were fairly standardized — Homer and Hesiod’s descriptions were as close to authoritative as Greeks ever got. If you compare them to visual art, though, you’ll see there’s a lot of variations: there really was no single canonical visual depiction — the presence of signs (like Zeus thunderbolt) was more likely to be the clear tip-off. But here are the literary sources for the gods and goddesses where we have some evidence about their complexions:

__Apollo__  (who was, after all, associated with the sun) was blonde: χρυσοκώμα or “golden haired”. Eros was also χρυσοκώμα. __Demeter__  was also a blonde, though usually described as ξανθή, “tawny” — as the goddess of grain the imagery is obvious. __Dionysus__ is a good example of the contradictory nature of Greek traditions: in the Homeric Hymns he has dark hair, but in Euripides he is a fair-skinned ξανθός.

__Hermes__  is blonde in Apuleius (a Roman source) but in many mosaics he is depicted as darker skinned than the figures around him — we’re not sure why. In the Ptolemaic period Hermes’ mythological counterpart was the Egyptian Anubis, who was usually depicted with a black jackals head in the Egyptian style — possibly the [conflation of the two traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermanubis) influenced the mosaics.

_Hermes (right) next to Silenus (seated) holding baby Dionysus._ 

__Aphrodite__  was definitely fair — this may reflect something of beauty standards, since females were usually depicted a fairer than males.* She had [στήθεσιν](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=sth%2Fqesin&la=greek&can=sth%2Fqesin0&prior=kai\) [ἀργυφέοισιν](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a%29rgufe%2Foisin&la=greek&can=a%29rgufe%2Foisin0&prior=sth/qesin) or “silvery white breasts” in the Homeric Hymns, and and in the Roman period Apuleius described her body as “dazzlingly white”. And as [Jellypantz](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jellypantz) pointed out in the comments, Hera is λευκώλενη or “white armed”

_Aphrodite is only rarely depicted with anything other than dark hair. This might reflect the connection between her and the Near East - her cult center was in Cyprus and had long cultural connections to Phoenician_ _[Astarte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astarte)_ 

__Athena__ and __Poseidon__ are both [described](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0159%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D14%3Asection%3D6) as γλαυκῶπις, which might originally have meant ‘light eyed’ but by the 4th century or so was blue or blue-grey eyed. Interestingly, though, Athena’s complexion was not fair: as a warrior goddess her complexion was ruddy. Poseidon was, however, “the dark haired god” in the Homeric Hymns. __Ares__  was also ruddy, since he too was a personification of war (Roman generals, in their triumphs, wore crimson body paint as they acted as stand in for Mars, the Roman version of Ares).

_Ruddy Ares contrasted with fair Aphrodite and a blond Eros. This is a Roman, rather than a Greek image and the redness of Mars may be a Roman not a Greek convention, or it may reflect the fact that Ares spends a lot of time outdoors._ 

Interestingly one name for __Zeus__  is Ζεύς Αἰθίοψ, “Zeus Aithiops” or literally “Burnt-face Zeus.” It’s thought that this is a reference to his role as a weather-god, analogous to a dark storm cloud. However Αἰθίοψ was the closest Greek equivalent to “person of color” (it applied equally to people from the Africa south of Egypt and Indians) so technically, at least, you could argue that one of Zeus’ identities was black.

One figure who does sometimes get distinctly darker, and arguably non-European features is [Silenus, ](http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Seilenos.html)the god of drunkenness. Mythologically, he raised Dionysus as a child, and Dionysus in the mythological land of [Nysa ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nysa_(mythology))(“Dionysus” just means “the god from Nysa.” The Greeks were not very clear on where Nysa was, but India and Ethiopia were common guesses. Silenus, therefore, is sometimes depicted with dark skin, a broad nose, and thicker lips:

_Silenus (note, though, that in the picture with Dionysus above he’s not as dark-skinned as Hermes)._ 

__TLDR__ : There were quite a few blondes among the Greek gods; Aphrodite and Dionysus were explicitly described as fair-skinned. But there’s no direct evidence for many of them, however, and the depictions are not consistent from place to place.

_* Egyptian art does the same thing - which is a reminder that you have to be wary of drawing too many conclusions from any single bit of evidence!_
