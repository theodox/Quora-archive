Because there is no alternative. __There are no original manuscripts of any of the Greek or Roman classics.__ 

There’s a possible exception in among the [Herculaneum papyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculaneum_papyri): if we can manage to recover their contents there is a good chance that we’ll have an autograph manuscript of the works of [Philodemus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philodemus), a minor Epicurean philosopher who lived nearby.

Apart from that, nothing. If you insist on working with the originals, you need to pack up and go home. Following that principle rigorously would wipe out huge swathes of our historical record. We have a handful of precious texts from the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries. Most of what we know about classical antiquity is written in manuscripts copied between the years 800 and 1200.

__How we got here__ 

If you’re wondering why this is the case, the answer is pretty simple. Papyrus is not an ideal writing material; in ordinary use rarely lasts more than a century or two in a dry climate like that of Egypt. In a wet climate it might only last a few decades. It’s vulnerable to water damage, to insects, and to fires. Just rolling out a papyrus to read it makes it start to fall apart. In the comments, [Philip Ingvaldsson Kitselis](https://www.quora.com/profile/Philip-Ingvaldsson-Kitselis) mentioned the [Derveni papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derveni_papyrus), which “survives” because it was carbonized on a funeral pyre. It’s probably the oldest extant Greek papyrus — it’s about a hundred years after Herodotus. It’s also best preserved (!) of, I believe, the _only_  _three_ surviving classical era papyri found in Greece.

This is the natural fate of any papyrus in regular use:

We do find pieces of very old papyrus — under unusual conditions. The Egyptian desert — particularly Egyptian tombs — can preserve papyrus for thousands of years. However that’s only because they are entirely undisturbed: documents in regular reading use would have fallen apart. Our best (indeed, in some ways our only) source for everyday texts in the Greek and Roman world are towns like [Fayum ](https://www.trismegistos.org/fayum/fayum2/392.php?geo_id=392)or [Oxyrhynchus](http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/VExhibition/exhib_welcome.html) in Egypt, where the desert conditions preserved a lot of thrown-away waste papyri from the town’s rubbish dump. This gives us an invaluable first hand look at daily life in the ancient world — including complaints about the difficulty of preserving papyrus records such as[ this complaint from Fayum](https://brill.com/view/journals/mnem/aop/article-10.1163-1568525X-12342734/article-10.1163-1568525X-12342734.xml)

> Since the books have been hastily moved from one place to another, repeatedly, lying on top of each other and unattached, due to the quantity, since the nome [= district] is so large, and since they are being handled daily, and their material is brittle, it happened that some were destroyed in parts, some others were without beginnings, and some had even fallen apart.

Since papyrus is fragile, even manuscripts which were carefully preserved had limited lifespans. In the later Roman period people started using parchment — that is, animal skin — bound between hard covers as a replacement for papyrus on rolls: essentially, this was the birth of the modern form of a book. The greater utility of this new form meant that old papyri were copied into it — and then generally discarded. This graph only looks at manuscript copies of the Greek New Testament, but it perfectly illustrates the tremendous difference in survival rates between papyri and parchment:

_Here “uncials” are older parchment manuscripts using letterforms that work well on parchment surfaces and “minuscules” are later parchments recopied after the introduction of capital letters around the 9th century. It’s worth pointing out that this includes fragmentary texts — most of the papyri are short fragmentary pieces._ 

__Extinction events__ 

Thus it’s no surprise that the originals have long since disappeared: our textual landscape is the product of the fragility of papyrus and the two great recopying waves — the transition from papyrus to parchment in the late Roman era and then from all-capital uncial script to mixed-case after the 9th century. By definition there can only be one original to any manuscript — and to reach us it they would have to survive 20-odd centuries of fires, floods, earthquakes, wars, animals and careless owners and then also the two eminently practical waves of recopying that happened between the era of papyrus and the Renaissance.

To give just one example: we know (assuming we can trust our texts, of course) that [some of Aristotle’s personal library ended up in buried underground](https://www.quora.com/If-the-Library-of-Alexandria-had-not-been-burned-down-how-closer-to-the-Greek-autographs-would-present-day-textual-criticism-be/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=416fd705&srid=zLvM) to hide it from predatory book-collectors; when it was dug up again much of it was ruined by the damp. The survivals were caught up in [Sulla’s sack of Athens in 86 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Athens_and_Piraeus_(87%E2%80%9386_BC)) and whatever survived that ended up in the clutches of the Roman dictator; presumably they perished in the great fire of 64, since we know that late-Roman followers of Aristotle were angry about the low quality of the texts in circulation in the second century. But: had Aristotle’s originals survived that, there would be another widespread fire in 80 and another in the 130’s. Since then the city has been sacked six times, suffered earthquakes and floods and even been bombed from the air.

Is it really surprising that those fragile pieces of papyrus are no longer with us?

We don’t have the original manuscripts for Shakespeare, only five centuries back. it would be astonishing if we had them for Herodotus — much less Homer, whose work was not written down for some centuries after it was composed and who [may not have been an individual person at all](https://www.quora.com/What-Who-inspired-Homerus-in-the-main/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=29bd7d4b&srid=zLvM).

So there’s no conspiracy and no mystery regarding the fate of the originals: they don’t exist, and for the most part they have not for more than a millennium. It’s a shame and a source of endless frustration for students of antiquity but it’s simply the ground truth which all discussion has to acknowledge.

__Un-original life__ 

In the modern hyper-skeptical age, where a few minutes with Google can make anyone feel like an expert, some people see this as evidence that they are being lied to or manipulated. They think that the people who work with these texts are blithely unaware of the gaps in the manuscript tradition.

In fact the exact opposite is true: any scholarly edition of ancient texts comes with a [critical apparatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_apparatus) that discusses the manuscript traditions which were used to create the text, the reasons why some versions were preferred over others, and the likely sources of transmission. Entire academic careers are made by arguments over the correct reading of a disputed passage or the reliability of a third party quotation in one of these texts. Almost nobody except specialists reads these arguments — they aren’t exactly thrilling — but modern editions are the result of at least five or six hundred years of sustained efforts to collate and clarify the textual tradition of these materials.



_This excellent series of videos by Bob Kaster of Princeton gives a good layperson’s overview of how a modern critical apparatus is created._ 

You can, if you choose, simply decide not to care: no originals or you won’t use it. but if you do the only intellectually honest position to take is to admit you cannot and will not ever have an opinion on events before, say, the year 800 or so. That’s a consistent point of view, but it’s about as relevant to any discussion of ancient history as flat-earthism is to a discussion of orbital mechanics.

If you do want to actually learn about this material, you can do what the last several centuries of scholarship have done with the different texts. You compare variant copies against each other, you look at the way different texts quote each other, you can try to compare them with archaeological evidence and so on. Despite the hullabaloo about manuscript traditions, we frequently find ways to check our texts against other evidence. The simplified version that makes its way to the History Channel or a high school textbook is based on a foundation that includes a lot of detailed, technical investigation into the quality, nature and often the disagreements of the source material.

For example, everything we know about the life and death of Julius Caesar comes primarily from texts that are physically no older than the 9th century or so. If you want to discard any non-original manuscripts you’ve got no “the die is cast”, no “you too Brutus?” (oldest manuscript circa 820) no “I came, I saw, I conquered” (oldest ms: 11th century), no “all Gaul is divided into three parts” (oldest manuscript: 9th century), no Caesar defying the pirates (oldest ms: 10th century). In short you're left without much besides a name. Even the identification of Caesar’s burial place in the Roman forum is based on texts which don’t pass the manuscript-original test.

But when you look at the archaeological records, you find things like this:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0d38f9087f4aa4dd0912b0e47154b5be)

A _coin of Caesar. The image on the right is Aeneas rescuing Anchises from the ruin of Troy, advertising Caesar’s supposed descent from Trojan royalty; the head on the left is Venus, whom Caesar claimed as his ancestor through the Trojan connection._ 

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2fd54e17aa81f611250e069b181ebb5f)

_A coin of Caesar, representing a captive Gaul (identified by his long hair and beard)._ 

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fd70d135e2f98ca857d5324bfcb6743e)

_A coin of Brutus, celebrating the assassination of Caesar: The reverse shows daggers and a freed slave’s cap, along with the legend_ Ides of March

This doesn’t “prove” the reliability of the traditional tales of Caesar —after all, it’s almost as easy to lie in an inscription as it would be do to so on paper — but it’s certainly more than just a fluke coincidence that these coins all echo what the sources tell us about him. Without the texts, we’d have no idea what “Ides of March” meant on a coin, or what he meant by showing a game of piggyback. On the other hand, without the coins we would have to wonder how much of the story that comes down to us was embroidered for political or literary reasons. The comparison (and sometimes, the conflict) between these two types of evidence makes both richer. Working ancient historians spend their careers looking at the consonances and conflicts between different texts and the archaeological record.

Professionalism is all about being aware of the interplay between all of these aspects of the problem. All historical argument is qualified by how these things are weighted. But radical skepticism of the “show-me-the-originals” variety comes from the same approach to evidentiary matters that gives us moon landing deniers, holocaust deniers, anti-vaxxers and flat earthers. It’s a stance, to be sure : just not a very productive one. More often than not it’s an attitude that people pick up and drop for argumentative convenience, rather like flat-earthers who still use GPS to get around while denying the possibility of geosynchronous satellites.
