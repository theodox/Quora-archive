A lot of traditional Roman religious ideas are Etruscan in origin, particularly the Roman obsession with divination; even later into the Republican period Etruscans had a reputation for otherworldiness and secret knowledge. Many Roman magicians and soothsayers used Etruscan or faux-Etruscan words and props as proof of their occult power. 

The Etruscans are also an important part of the legendary monarchical period of Roman history. Several Etruscan kings ruled over Rome, most infamously [Lucius Tarquinius Superbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus), whose unpoplarity resulted in a revolution, the birth of the Roman Republic, and several centuries of intense hostility to monarchy among the Roman people. You can spot evidence of Etruscan domination in some of the words they left in Latin, including _aes_ , for a coin; _palatium ,_ a palace; _milites_ , soldiers, and _arena_ : where gladiators fought. (see: [Etruscan language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_language)) _Triumph_ , the formal parade of a conquering army, may also be an Etruscan word that they themselves borrowed from Greece. All of this suggests, as to the legends of Etruscan kings, a powerful military presence.

 [Gladiatorial Games](http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/945159) may also be an Etruscan heritage; some scholars think they originated as an Etruscan religious rite or form of sacrifice.

It's quite possible that the Romans derived their own mythological connection to the Trojan War from the Etruscans. If the [Tyrsenian hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrsenian_languages) is right, the Etruscans may actually have origins in Western Asia minor and may have an authentic connection to historic troy; we know that they [liked Trojan War themes in their own art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrsenian_languages). It's possible that the arch-Roman hero Aeneas is a Trojan because he's really an Etruscan.
