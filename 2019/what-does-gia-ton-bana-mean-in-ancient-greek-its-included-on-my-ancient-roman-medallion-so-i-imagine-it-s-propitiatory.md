# What does “GIA TON BANA” mean in ancient Greek? It's included on my ancient Roman medallion, so I imagine it’s propitiatory.

Looking at the image, perhaps its ὑγιάτου rather than γιά τον

ὑγιάτης or “health giver” seems to be an epithet of Dionysos.

That terminal character is weird — it’s not written the same way as the earlier τ and in any case it’s hard to find a way it would show up as either a final τ or a χ since neither of those is a likely Greek ending. Βανας is attested as a proper (male) name in Egypt. Banat is “daughters” in Arabic and similar forms in other Semitic languages. I’d actually have said it was a cross, if not for thinking it’s ὑγιάτου.

Any idea of the provenance of the piece?
