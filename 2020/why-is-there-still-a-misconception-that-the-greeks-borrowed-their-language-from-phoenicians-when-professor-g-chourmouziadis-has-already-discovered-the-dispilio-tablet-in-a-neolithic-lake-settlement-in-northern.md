# Why is there still a misconception that the Greeks borrowed their language from Phoenicians when professor G. Chourmouziadis has already discovered the Dispilio Tablet in a Neolithic lake settlement in Northern Greece dating back to 6,000 BC?

1. Nobody can read the Dispilio tablet — we have no idea what language it represents.
2. Greek letterforms and even their names are clearly derived from Phoenician originals (“alpha” from “aleph”, “beta” from “beth” etc)

3. The Greeks said themselves:

> The Phoenicians who came with Cadmus—amongst whom were the Gephyraei—introduced into Greece, after their settlement in the country, a number of accomplishments, of which the most important was writing, an art till then, I think, unknown to the Greeks. At first they [the Phoenicians] used the same characters as all the other Phoenicians, but as time went on, and they changed their language, they also changed the shape of their letters. At that period most of the Greeks in the neighborhood were Ionians; they were taught these letters by the Phoenicians and adopted them, with a few alterations, for their own use, continuing to refer to them as the Phoenician characters—as was only right, as the Phoenicians had introduced them. The Ionians also call paper 'skins'—a survival from antiquity when paper was hard to get, and they did actually use goat and sheep skins to write on. Indeed, even today many foreign peoples use this material. In the temple of Ismenian Apollo at Thebes in Boeotia I have myself seen cauldrons with inscriptions cut on them in Cadmean characters—most of them not very different from the Ionian

4. Mycenaean linear B (from roughly 1450–1200 BC) clearly encodes Greek (it’s earlier than classical Greek letters and not related). But it falls out of use and is forgotten at the end of the Bronze Age. The earliest alphabetic Greek shows up in Euboea, which was a center of Phoenician trade in Greece starting around the 8th century BC.
