We’re not completely sure, since Cybele’s name has a long and rather muddy history. Greek __Κυβέλη__ and it’s Latin derivative __Cybele__  are just transcriptions of her name in the in extinct and not very well studied [Phrygian language](http://www.palaeolexicon.com/Phrygian) of Asia Minor. There, inscriptional evidence has here recorded as _Matar Kubileya_ — the first word is clearly the Phrygian word for “mother” but the meaning of _Kubileya_ is debatable at best. R[oman and Byzantine era Greek scholars said the name derived from the “Kybela mountains” of Phrygia,](http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/sol/sol-cgi-bin/search.cgi) though we have no source that tells us where exactly these mountains were and what the name might mean.

Asia Minor did have several other mother-goddess shrines associated with different place names, so it’s possible that Greeks accidentally transformed an epithet into a personal name: as if you translated “Our Lady of Lourdes” to “Lady Oflourdes.”

Since Phrygian and Greek are cousin languages, there have been a number of attempts at finding alternate etymologies by finding Greek words that could be plausible cognates for _Kubileya;_ none of these has become dominant, however.
