The short answer is “we can’t really be sure.” The usual scholarly guess is that chattel slavery was less widespread in Persia than in other contemporary cultures — but our evidence is pretty shaky and there’s a lot we don’t know. We certainly can’t provide anything like statistics.

The Achaemenids are [sometimes said to have “abolished” slavery, but that’s a myth. ](https://www.quora.com/Why-didnt-Persians-practice-slavery-through-history/answer/Steve-Theodore)In the places they conquered, they generally left pre-existing institutions alone — slavery continued unabated in the Greek cities of Asia Minor, but also in Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Levant. At least some Persians were large scale slaveholders — many of the satraps who feature in Greek sources are attended by large slave retinues, and one of our handful of surviving Persian letters concerns the satrap of Egypt writing to another Persian [demanding the return of his runaway slaves](https://wayback.archive-it.org/org-467/20190828084246/http://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/116/2013/10/Volume-2-text-and-translation-interleaved-20.1.14.pdf).

Nonetheless, there’s evidence which suggests that Persia proper was less inclined to the kind of large scale slavery you’d see in other contemporary cultures. Or at least, that the Persians found other ways to command labor.

One of our very few sources of first hand Achaemenid documents is the [Persepolis Fortification Archive](https://www.livius.org/sources/about/persepolis-fortification-tablets/), a cache of administrative records for the years 506 to 497 BC. One of the things they show are receipts for paid labor — strongly suggesting that some of the construction work was done by paid free artisans rather than the slaves one would have expected in contemporary Greece or Mesopotamia. Unfortunately the near complete lack of written sources from the Persian perspective makes it extremely hard to get past a vague sense that slavery was less common and practiced on a smaller scale than in most neighboring regions.

On the other hand, it’s important to remember that “slave” is not the only alternative to “free.” Rather than individual ownership of individual slaves, the Persian state seems to have preferred a different form of unfree labor.

The Persians [retained the ancient Babylonian practice of mass deportations](https://iranicaonline.org/articles/deportations#pt1), moving conquered people _en masse_  to strategic locations. While Cyrus is known to have returned deportees — most famously the Jews of Babylon — his successors at continued to shuffle large numbers of people around their empire at spearpoint. For example, Herodotus notes[ the existence of a town full of deportees from Cyrene in the middle of Bactria](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+4.204&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126), while Cambyses resettled several thousand Egyptians in Susa.

_This_ _[statue of Darius is from Susa.](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/susa/susa-photos/susa-statue-of-darius/)_ _It’s obviously the work of transplanted Egyptian craftsmen (note the hieroglyphic inscriptions as well as the style) — but we don’t know what their legal status was. Photo:_ _[Marco Prins](https://www.livius.org/pictures/iran/susa/susa-statue-of-darius-the-great/statue-of-darius-the-great/)_ 

We don’t have any good understanding of the legal status of these transplanted people. They don’t seem to have been treated as chattel slaves, since they were settled in communities and retained their own languages and cultures: we don’t see them being parcelled out to individual owners. On the other hand they don’t seem to have been free to move, and they were clearly required to do work: [Darius’ foundation inscriptions](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/achaemenid-royal-inscriptions/dsf/) from Susa proudly note the ethnicities of the craftsmen who did his earthwork (Babylonians), carved his columns (Greeks and Lydians) and adorned his walls (Medes and Egyptians).

What we _don’t_ know is whether they were free to negotiate their compensation, whether they were free to refuse the work, and how their working conditions compared to those of free Persians in the same place. Were they able to accumulate wealth, as we know the Jews of Babylon had been able to do? Or were they similar to Spartan helots, allowed to retain a limited communal life but otherwise subject to routine oppression?

With so little evidence, we have to be careful about conclusions. The PFA tablets do show that rations were disbursed to groups of workers by ethnicity. For the most part, though, these are payments in kind rather than cash, we can’t easily tell if this is the payment of laborers or the provisioning of unfree labor of some kind. The usual guess is that this was something more like what we’d recognize as serfdom than slavery: people who could own property and have families but were not free to choose their place of living of their livelihoods. These seem to have been people subject to someone’s command, but not a private “owner”: more likely the king himself acting through his appointed officials.

However, this is a guess based on limited evidence. Disdainful Greeks like Herodotus and Xenophon wrote that _everyone_ in Persia was a slave, subject to the whims of the king — mostly that sounds like like xenophobic hyperbole, but on the other hand Darius for example routine refers to his satraps and generals as _bandaka_ s, “slaves” in his own inscriptions: presumably hyperbole of the opposite sort. The [Encyclopedia Iranica article on the terminology of slavery ](https://iranicaonline.org/articles/barda-i)illustrates how shaky our grasp of the whole business really is.

The practice of mass deportation never died out. It seems like the Parthians retained it on a small scale (for example, the survivors of the Roman defeat at Carrhae were settled in Merv). The Sassanids, however, were extremely enthusiastic deporters, frequently transplanting the populations of entire cities. It might be best to see the quasi-feudal resettlement policy as an Iranic cultural alternative to chattel slavery: version of unfreedom centered around the state and the king rather than individual private owners.
