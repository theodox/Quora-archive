While I'm not all that expert in the field, Levi-Strauss is usually identified with [Structuralism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism), the idea that different cultures reflect a deeper universal human nature that is expressed in different ways but is fundamentally shared by all human beings. Since the 60's structuralism has been oppposed by [Post-structuralism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism), which is an explicit critique of the idea that there is some basic shared human nature that can be objectively studied. 

My informal understanding is that post-structuralism is the dominant mode in contemporary academia, and that work from a structuralist perspective will be regarded as an extension of a white, male, Eurocentric 'objectivist' tradition that most contemporary academics want to distance themselves from. Individuals, of course, will be all over the map.
