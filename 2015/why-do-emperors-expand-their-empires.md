I'd add to [User-10661484422791150723](https://www.quora.com/profile/User-10661484422791150723)'s answer that many expansions are "defensive". This is of course pretty subjective -- if you're being annexed by a powerful neighbor it probably seems very offensive to _you_  -- but many imperial acquisitions are intended, in whole or in part, to simplify the task of defending existing territories. 

The Romans, for example, tried to find natural defensive barriers -- like the Rhine, the Danube, or the deserts of Arabia -- to simplify the task of imperial defense (notably, they deliberately gave up on taking territory on the German side of the Rhine because that was too complex to defend). Many British imperial conquests were intended to protect existing possessions: you need Cape Town and Egypt to protect your sea routes to India, then you start building a chain of possessions in Africa to link the Cape to Egypt for easier supply and defense, and so on. 

Of course. this process can be illogical -- you end up with British troops in Afghanistan trying to protect British positions in Pakistan which were annexed to provide a buffer around Kashmir, etc, etc. paranoia is an integral part of empire building: you're not just worried about real threats but about future threats, and about the potential for future threats. This adds an important element of momentum to empire building that is hard for even very calculating statesmen to resist.
