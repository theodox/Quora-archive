That [Gandhi is a genocidal madman who makes Kim Jong Un look like a piker.](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Mahatma-Gandhi-Nukes-Everyone-In-The-Popular-Video-Game-Series-Civilization-WTF/#.n7qnzlsqy)

Actually this is not historiography, it’s what we in the business call a _won’t ever fix_  bug: it was a glorious mistake. It goes back, apparently, all the way to the earliest days of Civ. Gandhi’s aggression value was set to the lowest possible value (0 out of 255, I believe). However in the endgame of the modern era, when other players achieve democracy and lower the aggression values of their neighbors, that 0 can’t go any lower: so it _wraps around_ from the lowest possible value to the highest. And since this is also the stage of the game where nuclear weapons become available, there’s a really good chance that Gandhi will go Jack T. Ripper on anybody within reach.

I’m pretty sure that in more modern iterations of the game this one-time bug has been retained as a tongue-in-cheek design feature. It cannot be an accident that Gandhi seems to get the ‘nuke happy’ hidden agenda with uncanny regularity.

Game developers know their memes. I do not actually own a _[Keep Calm and Nuke Gandhi](https://www.redbubble.com/people/mrgreed/works/23587937-nuclear-gandhi?grid_pos=9&p=t-shirt&rbs=f394516f-3b92-4cfa-9c04-11503a23e150&ref=shop_grid&style=mens)_ __ t-shirt, but that’s not to say I have not been tempted.

On a slightly more serious level: I don’t really turn to civ for serious historiography. It has a built in technocratic bias that I don’t think does justice to the way civilizations really work; the path to victory is pretty much inevitably a march down a slightly tweaked version of the Whig Version of History. The chances for a really radical sidelight on the way historical processes unfold diminish rapidly once those first musketeers show up: it might be Moctezuma landing in Spain rather than the other way round in some games but the script is almost always _Guns, Germs and Steel_  without the germs.

Perhaps not surprisingly, given my proclivities, I find most of the fun in the first few hours of the game — from the time city #2 is a going concern up to age of circumnavigations. After that it always seems to play out as a reprise of the Industrial Revolution for me… but (a) I’m jaded and (b) I’m not disciplined enough to stop min-maxing and play for style points.
