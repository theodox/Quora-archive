# I have heard the claim that Greek thinkers stole philosophical ideas from other civilizations? Is this true?

There was plenty of borrowing, most of which was acknowledged pretty freely.

Greeks prized Egyptian doctors and medicine. They also regarded Egyptian religion with great, if somewhat puzzled respect: Alexander the Great chose to announce his divine parentage not at Athens or Delphi but at the [Oasis of Siwa](http://www.greece.org/alexandria/alexander/Pages/siwa.html) in Egypt. Egypt in general was regarded as a source of other-worldly wisdom: it was customary to assert that a particular Greek wise man ([Solon](http://oilismastery.blogspot.com/2009/02/wisdom-of-egypt-and-solon-in-platos.html), [Pythagoras](http://www.storyofmathematics.com/greek_pythagoras.html)*, and [Homer](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/homer/) are some famous examples) had ‘travelled to Egypt’ at some point in his career. It was pretty conventional to assign the earliest invention of several important arts and sciences — writing, mathematics, geometry and the essence of religion — to Egypt.

Farther east, The Greek alphabet was the ‘[Cadmean Letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Greek_alphabet)’, after the mythological Cadmus : a Phoenician. Greek astronomy really took off in the cities of Asia Minor while they were part of the Persian empire: [Thales of Miletus](http://www.iep.utm.edu/thales/), the first Greek to successfully predict an eclipse, was a Persian subject. Later [Claudius Ptolemy](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ptolemy), the greatest of Greek astronomers, used the accession of Babylonian king [Nabonassar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabonassar)* as the basis of his own calculations because the Babylonian records were so authoritative. Down to the end of antiquity anybody who wanted to make a career as an astrologer would be sure to surround himself with real or faked Babylonian props since everybody knew that the Babylonians were the masters of astronomy. Even the Greek names for the planets are just mythological name-swaps for the Babylonian names (Marduk becomes Zeus and so on).

In the later Hellenistic period various non-Greeks, writing in Greek, worked hard to claim credit for a variety of important inventions: [Berossus the Babylonian, Manetho the Egyptian, ](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/berossus/)and [Philo Judaeus](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Philo-Judaeus) among others all popularized the idea that their own civilizations had invented some or all of the key arts of civilization. There were also interesting, though more limited exchanges between Greeks and Indians: the Greek philosopher Pyrrho, the most famous of the [Skeptics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhonism), is said to have travelled to India to learn from what the Greeks called [Gymnosophists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnosophists): Indian ascetics.

So it’s obvious that the Greeks — who could be quite arrogant about their own “genius” — knew perfectly well that their neighbors has made important discoveries and were capable of learning from them.

That said, the idea of a “rip off” is usually associated with pseudo-history and conspiracy theories that don’t hold up to much scrutiny. We don’t know nearly as much as we’d like about the intellectual history of the ancient world — but the idea that it was dominated by some kind of cover-up that erased all sorts of key borrowings is too silly to waste time on — unless you buy the idea of a massive trans-temporal conspiracy too incompetent to erase something as glaringly obvious as Herodotus, Aristotle and Plato remarking casually that the Egyptians first invented geometry or things like that.

The Greeks took what they got from their neighbors and reshaped it in their own way — they didn’t feel any need to hide their obvious debts. No civilization stands alone: everybody is borrowing and remaking everybody else’s ideas all the time.

*Pythagoras also visited the Phoenician city of Tyre, where he probably picked up some useful math.
