# The Roman Empire at the time of Christ kept meticulous records. Why then, is there no record of the trial of Jesus?

You literally can’t conceive of how little survives from the mundane recordkeeping of the empire

Consider, for example, that the imperial Roman military kept between 250,000 and 450,000 men under arms continuously from the time of Augustus until at least the fourth century. That should make for between 4 and 6 million discharges over the first three centuries of the empire.

How many of those records survive? [About 1,000](http://www.romancoins.info/MilitaryDiploma1a.html).

We only have those because they were bronze tablets: a veteran would need them to claim his pension and prove his citizenship so they were made to be durable.

We don’t have any of the government’s copies. Zero.

In the Roman world, wooden tablets with a wax coating were the equivalent of modern notebooks. There are [about 500 surviving examples](http://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/newly-discovered-ancient-roman-writing-tablets-provide-snapshots-roman-era-020857): roughly one for every year of the western Roman empire… out of pretty much _every single everyday transaction in the entire empire_ .

Imagine trying to reconstruct the day-to-day history of the United States from its founding to today with only 400 or so pieces of paper. Most school kids generate more than that every semester.

Despite these incredible losses, we do have glimpses of the bureaucratic life of the empire — accidents of climate (particularly in Egypt, [where the climate is very kind to papyrus](http://pages.pomona.edu/~cmc24747/sources/plin_1-5.htm)) have left us all sorts of fascinating scraps: but they are scraps.

Things the Romans regarded as vastly more important than the fate of an unimportant provincial in a backwater territory are completely absent from the surviving records: we don’t have a complete Roman census or a single year’s official tax tallies (we have back-of-the envelope estimate for one vaguely defined period in the first century: that’s it). We don’t have the [poems of Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poems_by_Julius_Caesar), the [songs Nero sang at the Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius#Scholarly_works_and_their_impact), the [history writing of emperor Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius#Scholarly_works_and_their_impact), or even a [contemporary account of Rome’s most powerful conqueror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius#Scholarly_works_and_their_impacthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan#Sources), Trajan. The tragic truth of ancient history is that the losses are unimaginably vast.

The chances of any individual record surviving are minuscule: far worse than the 5000:1 odds of a bronze discharge tablet. Assuming the records were written down in the first place their survival would be nothing short of, let us say, “miraculous.”
