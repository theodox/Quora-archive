There are plenty of academic departments studying games as a real subject. The field is known as [Ludology](http://www.ludology.org/). It's true that ludology degrees don't have the same degree of recognition as older humanities disciplines, but these programs are out there. There is usually a game-studies conference alongside the [Game Developor's Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/conference/summits.html) every year and there are programs and conferences in Europe as well. For reasons I don't understand it seems like Northern Europe has the largest number of degree programs. Don't confuse academic ludology with game development programs, which are more practical - like film school than film studies; Development-oriented programs are much more common than ludology programs.

My personal feeling is that the programs tend to suffer from the film/literature model rather than benefit from it: the critical discourse on games tends to be dominated by the overuse of literary and cultural-criticism tropes: too much of it could just be cut-and-pastes from any English or Film Studies department with the title of the game swapped in for the title of a book or movie. It's particularly galling how much game criticism tends to gloss over the real-world constraints of making games, mistaking technological accidents for authorial intention and vice-versa. 

Of course, I'm in the business and that's pretty much how people who make things feel about people who study them in every field :) It's still flattering to be studied, even when the people doing the studying seem of touch with your own experience.

Here's a good example of game critical discourse in action. And it actually tries to take the game side seriously instead of treating the game like a movie, which is a big win: [Killing is Harmless: A Critical Reading of Spec Ops: The Line.](http://www.amazon.com/Killing-Harmless-Critical-Reading-Spec-ebook/dp/B00B9P2WP6)
