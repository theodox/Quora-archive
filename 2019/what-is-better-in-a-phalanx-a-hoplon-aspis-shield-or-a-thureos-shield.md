Macedonian phalangites didn’t use the traditional hoplite _aspis_ .

A classical Spartan or Athenian _aspis_ was pretty big, with a diameter of about a meter and a weight as much as 7–8 kg (14 lbs). Because it was heavy and unwieldy, it required most of the effort of the user’s left hand. The traditional hoplite held his spear, his _doru_ , with one hand only:

The Macedonian phalangite needed two hands to manage that big, heavy _sarissa_ pike_,_ which itself weighed about the same as older aspis and was long and unwieldy.

So, Philip II switched his troops to using a smaller shield, more like 66 cm / 2.12 ft across, which included a weight bearing neck strap. It was kind of a cross between an aspis and a skirmishers _pelta —_  it was a small as the latter but had the same kind of grip as the former. There was a hand strap that could be used to control the shield in close combat, but if the user put his hand through the strap instead he could cover himself with the shield and use his left hand on his pike. Some depictions even show phalangites with crescent-moon shaped shield, a form which was pretty common with the _pelta._

The _thureos_  got popular in the Hellenistic period, when different troop-types were needed to supplement the Macedonian phalanx. _Thureophoroi_  were medium infantry with shorter spears, often wearing mail shirts. They would have looked a lot like the Roman infantry of the Punic War period. In fact, it’s been suggested that the _thureos_  came back from Italy with Pyrrhus, which would mean that both Roman and Hellenistic armies were borrowing from a common Gallic root. In the second century BC, Hellenistic armies that wanted to imitate Roman tactics — like the Seleucids under Antiochus IV — often used _thureophoroi_ as the basis of their reforms.

_A thureophoros — note the shorter spear._
