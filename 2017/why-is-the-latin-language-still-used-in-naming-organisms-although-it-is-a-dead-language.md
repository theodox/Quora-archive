Historically, it goes back to the work of [Carolus Linnaeus](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html), aka. Carl von Linné — the 18th century Swedish biologist. His major work, the [Systema Naturae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae) or “System of Nature” was the largest and most comprehensive effort to record and classify all of known organisms and still forms the basis of the [binomial nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature) used in modern biology.

Why Latin? In Linnaeus’ day Latin was the international language of science in Europe. You could not be regarded as an educated person if you didn’t read Latin — a situation that was true well into the 19th century when nationalism began to elevate the status of different modern languages for patriotic reasons. As a Swede, writing in Latin was also a canny choice: if he’d written the same book in Swedish, it would never have achieved international fame.

Today the system survives because it’s still an excellent method of providing a single reference point for speakers of different modern languages — and, unlike adopting a living language as a new standard it’s also unlikely to get bogged down in politics.
