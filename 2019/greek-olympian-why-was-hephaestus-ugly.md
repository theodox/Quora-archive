There’s a theory (as with many of these things, it’s suggestive without being a slam-dunk truth) that Hephaestus’ disabilities reflect the real-life curse of bronze-age smiths: arsenic poisoning.

Hephaestus is the god of the forge, the patron god of smiths. In the age when Greek mythology took form, these were bronze workers rather than iron-working blacksmiths. And bronze workers — particularly before around the end of the Bronze Age, when tin became scarce — used to add arsenic to their copper to make a harder alloy. Some copper sources also come with a lot of arsenic naturally: “Ötzi the iceman,” the famous alpine mummy, may have been a metalworker, since he had a beautiful copper axe with high arsenic content and a lot of arsenic residue in his hair.

Most people know that powerful doses of arsenic can be fatal; However[ long term exposure to arsenic ](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/arsenic)doesn’t kill, at least not right away: instead, it causes nerve damage, which can lead to limping or gait problems. It causes eruptions and discoloration of the skin, lesions, and skin cancer. Exposure in children can stunt their growth — popular informal representations of Hephaestus were often dwarfish.

So there’s a good chance that Hephaestus’ limp, his reputation for ugliness, and his association with dwarfism reflect the harsh reality of life in a bronze-age forge (it may also be the background to the association between mythological dwarves and metalworking skill).

Copper, incidentally, is strongly connected to the island of Cyprus (the name means “Copper”) . The feminine version of Cyprus in Greek is [Κύπρις](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=*ku%2Fpris&la=greek&can=*ku%2Fpris0&prior=*(/hra) (“Kypris”) a very common nickname for Aphrodite. The marriage of the ugly smith and the beautiful love goddess is almost certainly an allegory for the close connection between bronze-smiths and the copper mines of Cyprus, which dominated the Bronze Age.

It’s also quite likely that Hephaestus’ dismal luck as a lover reflects the aristocratic values of the Bronze and early Iron Ages, where warrior aristocrats looked down on craftsmen who worked with their hands. As the only Olympian who could be described as “working class,” his status reflects the ambivalence of a society that depended on skilled artisans without valuing them socially.
