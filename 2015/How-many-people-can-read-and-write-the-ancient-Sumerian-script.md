It's a non-trivial undertaking to learn Sumerian: it's generally believed to be a language isolate, with no living relatives to build off of, and the writing system is a complex web of syllabic, ideographic and hybrid signs. Plus later text might include bits of Akkadian -- a separate language written in the same characters. 

Still, there are quite a few hardy souls who have learned it: If I had to guess I'd say the number of people with some exposure is in the low thousands, primarily archaeologists and academics.
