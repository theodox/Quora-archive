In the Republican period an _ala_ is more or less like a legion, except that it’s not made up of Roman citizens. During the Republic most “Roman” armies combined Roman troops with troops from the _socii_  — Rome’s allies, particularly the Latins but other Italian peoples as well. In the republican period these units would be about the same size as a legion — around 5000 men — but would often have different troop types.

Later on the term changed it’s meaning, and referred exclusively to cavalry units raised from Roman allies and/or subjects. A cavalry _ala_ would be about 500 troopers.

A _cohort_  is an infantry unit of about 500 men (480 is the classical figure, though like most military figures the reality varied a lot. A late-Republican or early imperial legion had 10 cohorts.

The names in question are probably imperial-era unit names, recognizable by the ethnic identifiers attached to them (those noun endings in Latin mean “of the XXXXs” - so the _cohors Delmatarum_  is made up of Dalmatians*, the _cohors Rhaetorum_  of Rhaetians, and so on. The _Ala Agripiana Miniata is an ala_ associated with a Roman named Agrippa, probably Augustus’ second-in-command [Agrippa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Vipsanius_Agrippa), or possibly [Herod Agrippa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_Agrippa). _Miniata_ means red or purple: probably this is an elite cavalry unit.

Here’s the loconyms:

_Nerviorum_ : raised from the [Nervii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervii) in Gaul

_Vasconum_ : raised among the [Vascones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascones) in Basque country

_Delmatarum_ : raised among the Dalmatians on the Adriatic

_Raetorum_  (I think it should be Rhaetarum) : raised from the [Rhaeti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhaetian_people) in the Alps.

* Dalmatians from Dalmatia, not from Disney in case there was any doubt.
