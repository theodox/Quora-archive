It’s actually a trickier question than you might guess.

The immediate answer would be ___nihil sacrum___ , but the adjective _sacer_  is something of a false friend for English speakers. It has a technical meaning in older Latin: “dedicated to the service of a god.” which doesn’t exactly have the English connotation of being inherently good or holy.

So, for example, you could use _sacer_  to describe something fairly mundane that had a ritual function (the first example in a Latin dictionary is often _sacres porci,_ “sacred” pigs —a proverbial expression meaning “a pig more than 10 days old”, since smaller piglets were not regarded as an appropriate sacrifice. _Sacer_  tended picked up a meaning more like English _sacred_  over time, but in Republican-era Latin _nihil sacrum_  would feel closer to “nothing is ritually consecrated.”

There’s also an even older usage where _sacer_  means something like “cursed” — in one of the oldest examples of written Latin, somebody convicted of stealing his neighbor’s land is _sacer_  because it was a death penalty offense and the criminal will be executed as a sacrifice to Ceres. That negativity was extended to all sorts of other sacrilegious behaviors, so that _sacer_ could actually mean “detestable” or “unholy” or just “off limits”.

So, _nihil sacrum_  would work for a Latin speaker from about the fourth century onward, but might sound off to earlier Romans. If the emphasis is “nothing is off limits” than _sacrum_  works well — but if it’s more like “nothing is holy” or “nothing is to be revered” I might try ___nihil sanctum___  instead.

You could also swap ___nil___  for ___nihil___ _—_ they tend to be almost interchangeable (unless you’re Cicero, who always used _nihil_  so it’s probably the fancier choice).
