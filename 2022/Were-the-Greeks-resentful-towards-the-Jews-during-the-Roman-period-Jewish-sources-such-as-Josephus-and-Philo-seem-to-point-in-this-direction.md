Greek Jewish relations had a long backstory by the Roman period. In general, by the beginning of the first century BCE Greek attitudes had hardened into hostility and contempt. Before that period attitudes were more mixed.

There are no unambiguous mentions of Jews or Judaism the Classical era. In the early Hellenistic period there are some positive accounts of Jewish “philosophy” and reference to the achievements of Moses as a lawgiver. There were still negative stereotypes during this era as well, but attitudes are best characterized as “mixed.”

However [the long, bitter conflicts arising from the Seleucid empire’s callous handling of its Jewish province](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvbkjxph.20?seq=10#metadata_info_tab_contents) had a lasting effect on the Greek image of Judaism. This is most famously the era of Antiochus IV and the Maccabean revolt which featured a Greek king sacrificing a pig on the altar in the Temple of Jerusalem and reciprocal massacres between traditional Jews, Greeks, and Hellenized Jews. Unsurprisingly, positive stereotypes generally disappeared from Greek writings and the negatives came to represent the default Greek attitude.

_The_ _[Heliodorus Stele](https://www.imj.org.il/en/exhibitions/heliodorus-stele)_ _records a royal decree granting control of temple finances within Seleucid Judaea to_ _[Heliodorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliodorus_(minister))_ _, mentioned in_ _[2 Maccabees 3](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/2maccabees/3)_ _as responsible for efforts to tax the Jewish temple — circa 178 BCE._ 

Although the Greek-Jewish tensions really originated in Judaea, in the next couple of centuries the epicenter of Greek antisemitism moved to Alexandria. Under the early Ptolemies the Jewish diaspora community in Egypt had generally fared quite well. The early Ptolemaic rulers found good uses for a minority distinct from both the native Egyptians and the Greek populations of the cities — Jews occupied prominent places in the bureaucracy and the army. The earlier Ptolemaic period was generally a good time for Jews in Greek Egypt; it’s the era which produced the [first Greek translation of the Torah](https://www.logos.com/grow/the-origin-of-the-lxx/) and the [beginnings of Jewish literature in Greek.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristobulus_of_Alexandria)

Unfortunately the role of favored minority tainted the Jews in the eyes of their Greek and Egyptian neighbors. The standard accounts of Jewish origins in Greek writers reflect the intersection of two sets of prejudices: Greek And Egyptian retellings of the Exodus story turn it upside down. Instead escaping from slavery the Jews were expelled — either because their alien religion brought plagues upon the land or, more pungently, because they were all lepers and bandits. There’s a [roundup of these accounts here.](http://www.philipharland.com/Blog/2022/08/egyptian-diasporas-legends-of-migration-concerning-hyksos-and-judeans-late-fourth-century-bce-and-on/)

Alexandria was a particular flashpoint, where wealthy Greek-speaking Jews believed they deserved citizen rights equal to those of the city’s Greeks. The Alexandrian Greeks were fiercely protective of their special status. Native Egyptians could become “Greek enough” by adopting Greek culture — though very few had the economic opportunity to do so, since most Egyptians were legally tied to rural agriculture. The few who were able to Hellenize tended to become enthusiastic anti-Semites since this was an effective way of advertising their credentials as proper Greek gentlemen while also sticking a thumb in the eye of a rival ethnic group. The fiercest anti-Semites of the early Roman period were the Egyptians [Apion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apion) — whose credentials included both excellent Homeric scholarship and efforts to incite Roman authorities against Alexandria’s Jews — and [Lysimachus](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/lysimachus-of-alexandria-x00b0), whose hostile rendition of the Exodus tradition was regarded as the most insulting retelling.

The tensions of the early Roman period exploded into communal violence in Alexandria in [38 CE,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandrian_riots_(38_CE)) a series of riots which is often described as “the first pogrom.” Re-enacting the tensions of the Seleucid era there were efforts to force the Jews of the city to worship the emperor as a god, with reluctance treated as sedition. A plan to install a statue of Caligula in the Temple in Jerusalem was only abandoned because of the emperor’s death. After Caligula was off the scene, peace was restored — temporarily.

However by this point the Roman empire was itself on a collision course with Jewish sensibilities. The [Jewish revolt of 66 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War)— spurred by a mixture of cultural conflict and political resentments — ratcheted Greek-Jewish tensions everywhere in the eastern Mediterranean. As many as 50,000 Jews in Alexandria were killed by Roman troops backing the Greek Alexandrian crowds in 66.* A [second rebellion in 115](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War) produced frankly genocidal violence on both sides, with hundreds of thousands of civilians killed and the Jewish community of Egypt — more than a million people before the conflict — effectively extinct.

All of this conflict was reflected in wider Greek attitudes and, increasingly, in Roman sources as well: Romans like Tacitus recycled derogatory accounts from Greek sources as Rome and the Jews traded atrocities. Roman attitudes towards early Christianity were also colored by the ambient anti-Semitism of the Greco-Roman milieu.

It is worth pointing out that on the local level — removed from imperial politics and the resentments of the Greek elite who themselves had been socially eclipsed by Romans — there was a lot more cultural exchange and assimilation in both directions. Judaism in the early empire gained a lot of converts, particularly at Rome: many imperial cultures have been strangely entranced by the otherness of their defeated subjects.

Nevertheless, the general Greek attitude towards Jews and Judaism in the Roman era was a mix of hostility, contempt, and misunderstanding. It’s remarkable how poorly informed Greco-Roman anti-Semites actually were: the most famous slur of the era is the old Seleucid-era canard, repeated by the Roman Tacitus, that the Jews in their inner sanctum secretly worshipped a donkey’s head. This isn’t even some kind of distorted echo of an actual Jewish practice: it’s pure vitriol, recycled for centuries, and sadly emblematic of Greco-Roman-Jewish relations in the imperial era.
