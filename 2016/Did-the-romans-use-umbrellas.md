Parasols, for sun shade, were very well known in antiquity. They were a common sight in Persia:

This image is from a Greek city in Campania, in southern Italy â€” the likeliest way the Romans would have gotten them.

In those days the primary usage was for sun-shade rather than for rain protection.
