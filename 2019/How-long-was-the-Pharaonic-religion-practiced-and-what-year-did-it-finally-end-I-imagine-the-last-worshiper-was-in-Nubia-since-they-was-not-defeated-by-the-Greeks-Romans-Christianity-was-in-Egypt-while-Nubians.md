# How long was the Pharaonic religion practiced and what year did it finally end? I imagine the last worshiper was in Nubia since they was not defeated by the Greeks & Romans. Christianity was in Egypt while Nubians practiced the old religion, correct?

There’s no easy way to say “last” for something as complex as a religion.

The last known hieroglyphic inscription is from the year 394; it was found on the island of [Philae, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philae)just above the Egyptian border with Nubia. However the temple where the inscription was found continued to operate, in a rather diminished form, until the 520s. What we don’t really know, however, is what was really going on within the temple — was it a stately continuation of an ancient tradition? Or did the beliefs of the people change with the times? Because there’s little internal evidence for what people believed, it’s hard to be sure.

Still, it’s not a bad guess that traditional ideas lingered longer farther south, far from the influence of Alexandria and of the monastic centers in the Thebaid. That last temple on the island of Philae was known as a pilgrimage destination for people from across the southern border.

However it’s a mistake to assume that the Nubians were somehow frozen in time. By the time of that last hieroglyph “Nubia” — more precisely, the [Kingdom of Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush)— was no longer independent and its own once Egyptianate official culture was no more. By 394 it had been reduced to an underpopulated province of the [Axumite Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum), which had been expanding north from what’s now Ethiopia for a couple of centuries. This doesn’t mean that the region as a whole was in decline, however: the Red Sea region was anything but an isolated cultural backwater. The vibrant Indian Ocean trade, which tied up the Roman world with India, Arabia and east coast of Africa helped make the religious and cultural landscape of the Red Sea coast and the upper Nile very complex

So, even before 394 it’s misleading to think of Kush following a “pure” version of the old pharaonic religion. It’s probably significant that the last temple at Philae which continued in operation was a temple of Isis: under the Ptolemies and into the Roman period, the worship of Isis had eclipsed many aspects of the traditional Egyptian religion. Isis cults offered a strong focus on personal salvation rather than the traditional pharaonic emphasis on cosmic order and the prosperity of the state — it had, after all, been [many centuries since a full-time Pharaoh actually lived in Egypt, and the old royal religion was correspondingly weakened](https://www.quora.com/After-the-death-of-Cleopatra-did-the-title-of-pharaoh-become-associated-with-Roman-emperors-How-did-the-Romans-reconcile-the-principate-emperors-with-the-position-of-a-foreign-king/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=77aa535d&srid=zLvM).

There’s also evidence that shows the older Egyptian-influenced religious and artistic styles were being supplemented by new ideas long before the fourth century. For example the second century Kushite temples at [Naqa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqa) include an eclectic mix of deities; alongside traditional Egyptian gods like Amon you find imagery of the Greco-Egyptian [Serapis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapis) and the lion-headed war god [Apedemak](https://henadology.wordpress.com/theology/netjeru/apedemak/) who is not part of the Egyptian pantheon and seems to be depicted as replacing Osiris.

_Although this looks very Egyptian in style, the lion-headed god Apedemak (central figure facing right) is a uniquely Nubian deity with no Egyptian antecedent. He seems to have been treated in Nubia as the father of Horus (second from left ). In Egyptian tradition Horus’ father was Osiris.

However, the most famous example of religious change in the region dates all the way back to the end of the first century, when the Acts of the Apostles reports that [the evangelist Philip baptized an “Ethiopian Eunuch”, a servant of the Kandake or queen of Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_eunuch).

What’s particularly interesting about the story is that it takes place on the road from Jerusalem to Gaza — _not_  in Kush; the eunuch was returning home after a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, which indicates that there was already Jewish religious influence in Kush in the first century. This is less surprising than it sounds; there was [a large Jewish community on the Nile island of Elephantine from about the 6th century BC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantine_papyri), just downriver of Philae and well within reach of Kushite visitors. Evidently Judaism too was another idea that traveled up the Nile. The modern [Ethiopian Jewish community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Israel) claims descent from Jews who lived in the region at least as far back as the early fourth century.

As it happens, thanks to its long connection to the Mediterranean religious world, the empire of Axum actually embraced Christianity a little _before_  the Roman empire did. Here’s a coin of Axumite king Ezana from around the 330’s:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1114e9dd898049abe31effe042f77978)

At this point Roman coins were still using pagan imagery like these (issued by Constantine himself):

_Constantine (left) and the sun-god Sol Invictus (right), from around 320._ 

The story of Axum’s conversion is a perfect illustration of how complex life in the horn of Africa was in the 300’s.

Earlier inscriptions from king Ezana himself are dedicated not to Christ but to [Mahrem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maher_(god)), a war-god who was worshipped on both shores of the Red Sea. Ezana was converted by a Syrian Christian with the Latin name [Frumentius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frumentius), who was taken as a slave by Axumites in his youth but eventually became an influential figure in Ezana’s court. Traditionally Frumentius was not the first or only Christian in Axum, but his influence allowed the existing community there to come out of the shadows. Late in Ezana’s reign the Roman emperor in Constantinople tried to convince Axum to replace Frumentius with [Theophilos the Indian,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophilos_the_Indian) a churchman from the far-off Maldive Islands. Ezana, however, retained his friend Frumentius and the matter was dropped.

We don’t know very much about Axumite religious policy in this period, so we can’t say how much or how little freedom of worship was accorded to followers of the old ways. The former Kushite province of [Nobatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobatia), between the Nile and the Red Sea, was politically independent and seems to have retained elements of Kushite culture for another couple of centuries, along with a smattering of Greco-Roman elements. Unfortunately we don’t know much about it — though since the Nobatae were largely nomadic pastoralists it’s a good guess that they probably had a rather different take on the Egyptian tradition than the people of the Nile Valley did.

If the case of Egypt provides an analogy, it’s a good guess that there was no sharp dividing line: some old beliefs were recast in Christian terms, others became part of folk tradition or magical practice, and many just faded away once they no longer commanded state support. The social and political conditions which created the classic pharaonic religious traditions in Egypt were centuries gone in 394 and the Axumite kings had no reason to patronize the state religion of their one-time Kushite subjects. On the other hand connections to the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean were bringing a variety of new influences which found local adaptations.

If that date is right, this manuscript is contemporary with the last ever hieroglyphic inscription at Philae — it’s also one of the oldest complete gospel manuscripts in the world.
