Greeks were a comparatively “young” people — a lot of their experience of Egypt was being amazed at its long traditions. You can get a sense from the fact that the first mention of anything like “Greece” in Egyptian records is in the Twelfth Dynasty — meaning that twelve lines of Pharoahs had already come and gone before the Egyptians met the Greeks.

In the Bronze Age there was some trade in Egyptian good s in mainland Greece, but it’s not really clear how much the Egyptians knew about Greece first hand. Their main contacts were with [Crete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete), which for most of that period was a distinctive culture. it was conquered by Greeks around 1400 BC. It’s not clear exactly what relations in this period were like — the Egyptian records tend to portray all foreign contacts as “tribute”, implying that foreigners were subjects off the Egyptian empire — which might or might not be true in this case. They were also pretty vague about the geography of Greece: they tended to lump everything in the Mediterranean together as “the islands”, and not to distinguish very carefully between Cretans, mainland Greeks, and other people from the Mediterranean.

However you occasionally see images in Egyptian art from this period which seem to reflect contemporary Greek dress or objects:

However this version of Greek civilization [collapsed along with much of the Near Eastern world ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse)around 1200 BC. For the next five hundred years or so Greece was pretty chaotic; Egypt was the only major civilization in the region which survived the disaster more or less intact. It’s [possible that the collapse pitted Greek warriors against the Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples) — and [also possible that they were allies](http://It’s not clear exactly what relations in this period were like — the Egyptian records tend to portray all foreign contacts as “tribute”, implying that foreigners were subjects off the Egyptian empire — which might or might not be true in this case. They were also pretty vague about the geography of Greece: they tended to lump everything in the Mediterranean together as “the islands”, and not to distinguish very carefully between Cretans, mainland Greeks, and other people from the Mediterranean. ). Records from this chaotic time are very spotty (and the Egyptian ones are mostly wartime propaganda) so we are less then certain.

_An Egyptian warrior defeats one of the “_ Peleset_” people — who are_ _[sometimes identified with the Greeks](http://luwianstudies.org/iron-age/canaan-palestine/)_ _by their equipment._ 

By around 700 BC Greece had reorganized into the familiar city-state form and Greek people were expanding across the Mediterranean as traders and colonists. Trade picked up and contacts increased. The Egyptians had lost a lot of their military power — their rivals in Assyria, Babylon and finally Persia were a constant threat, so they began to use Greek mercenaries. Under Pharaoh [Psamtik I ( 664 -610 BC) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psamtik_I)the Egyptians established a permanent Greek settlement in Egypt, at [Naucratis ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naucratis)for traders and mercenaries to live in. That city played a hugely important role in diffusing Egyptian arts and technology throughout the Greek world.

In Greek mythology, the [ruling dynasty of Argos was supposed to be descended from Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegyptus); we don’t have any good way of knowing if this reflects real contacts, if it’s a bit of propaganda from this period when Egyptian prestige in Greece was especially high, or if it;’s pure literary invention.

From the establishment of Naucratis onwards the two cultures were in constant close contact; the Greeks were frequent allies of the Egyptians in fighting the Persians, and eventually Alexander the Great liberated Egypt from Persia. The last dynasties of Egypt were the [Ptolemies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom) — descendants of one of Alexander’s generals. Cleopatra was a Ptolemy. The Ptolemies remained Greek in their language and culture but they went out of their way to support traditional Egyptian culture and religion. We only know how to read hieroglyphs because of inscriptions in both Greek and Egyptian found on temples built by the Ptolemies.
