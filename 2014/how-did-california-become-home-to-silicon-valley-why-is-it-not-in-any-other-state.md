A lot of it is tied up with the story of [Fairchild Semiconductor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor), which pioneered the semiconductor and the intergrated circuit: the "Silicon" in Silicon Valley. 

Fairchild started in Mountain View in the 50's. Competition for talent and access to specialized resources encouraged other competitors to set up shop in the same area, and as the industry grew new companies were often formed by employees who didn't want to leave the area. 

The "modern" Silicon Valley - dominated by software and venture capital - is the granchild of the old old electronics-industry stronghold. Lots of people think Apple is the quintessential Silicon Valley company, but for my money it's [Fry's Electronics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fry%27s_Electronics): full of electronics components, a little shady, self-indulgently goofy, and basically nerd paradise.
