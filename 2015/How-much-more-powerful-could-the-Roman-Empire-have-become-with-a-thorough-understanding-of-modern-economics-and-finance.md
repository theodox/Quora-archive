That's a really interesting one. The biggest issue for a modern central banker would be the extreme difficulty of manipulating the money supply in antiquity: in a world where weight of metal is the primary standard of value, things like interest rates and bond sales are at best very weak levers to move the fate of nations.

There are really three distinct periods in the Roman economy and the role of 'economic policy' would be very different for each.

In the the __Republican period__  (particularly before 146 BC when Rome became the dominant power in the Mediterranean). Rome was still primarily one city-state in a world of city-states. This kind of economic and political fragmentation tended to keep everyone in the Roman world much poorer: many cities had rules and regulations intended to protect local producers or to keep the city from becoming dependent on hostile neighbors. Small-scale inter-city wars, and the resulting rivalries and hostilities, often led to very strange patterns of trade and exchange (a famous, though not Roman, example is the three-way rivalry between Athens, Corinth and Thebes, who should have been natural trading partners but who were usually bitter rivals who went out of their way to cut each other out of business when possible).

City state finances tended to be very simple: the wealth of the city was the gold and silver stored within its walls and the produce of the fields which its armies could control. The most common form of wartime fundraising, for example, was to melt down the precious furnishings and statues in the temples in order to buy food or arms. The common ancient practice of “dedications,” — where a victorious general or politician would vow an expensive new temple or statue — was in an economic sense the ancient equivalent of a rainy day fund.

In that world. a modern central banker would probably be more interested in trade policy than in finance proper: in lowering barriers to trade, regularizing things like weights and measures, and encouraging the formation of larger trading regions with lower friction. A truly machiavellian banker might have tried engineer a religious reform or maybe a periodic oracular pronouncement encouraging a general 'meltdown' of temples (the Babylonians had a habit of razing and rebuilding temples on a fairly regular basis) in order to release more money into circulation.

One thing that the Romans were pretty good at, and which a modern economist would have loved, was record-keeping. I'm sure that the Roman census would have become an important tool for getting data (which in all other ways would be in very, very short supply in that world).

In late days of the Republic and during the heyday of the __principate__ , the economy had some very modern features: the _Pax Romana_  meant a huge increase in the ease and safety of long distance trade and along with it a corresponding rise in economic specialization. The end of the republic replaced a very erratic and often hugely corrupt series of provincial governors with a somewhat higher class of administrator. Imperial legates were hardly angels (almost literally the reverse in the case of Pontius Pilate!) but they were significantly better for the provincials than the ambitious and usually grasping politicians they replaced.

Pottery from Arretium, tin from Britain, glass from Libya, grain from Egypt and silk from the far east circulated far more freely and widely during this period than before or afterwards: it was a 'globalizing' period like today or like the late 19th century. Economies of scale and local competitive advantages blossomed in classic Econ 101 fashion -- this was a large part of the reason the first two centuries AD were such good times, historically speaking.

Hard currency remained the only real control over the money supply. As the empire gradually replaced the patchwork of alliances and client kingdoms with a more or less uniform administration, it became easier for the government to simulate something like a real central banks function by tweaking the metal content of the coinage:

Unfortunately the ancient version of this practice tended to be badly abused. It was a common way for cash-strapped emperors to pay bills without raising taxes: but, like many modern equivalents, it drove inflation and also tended to encourage non-cash economics (more about that later). If you google "roman coin debasement" you'll find a lot of monetarists who think of this as the origin of "printing money", and while that's an exaggeration, Roman minting does have some resemblance to the problems of a paper currency.

In that environment a little modern economics really _could_ be useful. Ancient critics of debasement viewed it as a moral problem: dishonesty on the part of the prince, trying to pay his bills on the cheap. If a modern economist could get a hearing, he or she would definitely want to talk up the virtues of having a flexible money supply and using it to either encourage more movement or to discourage hoarding.

This would, however, have been a very tough sell: it's not a universally popular opinion today, despite many centuries of paper money -- in a world where traders routinely 'clipped coins', shaving off bits of precious metal to short-change their customers -- it would take a lot of selling to make that idea popular. The traditional figure of justice is blind because honest weights and measures were the cornerstone of fairness::

Unfortunately -- as lots of the people with the Roman currency graphs will tell you --- the combination of political instability and spiraling currency debasement really got out of hand in the [Crisis of the Third Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century), when for the better part of a century the empire tore itself apart with military coups and palace intrigue. All of that fighting was expensive, and much of it was paid for by debasing the currency. This had a ruinous impact on the vibrant commercial economy of the principate. Cash became less reliable (and it was easier to confiscate or steal). Taxes went up, which encouraged more and more self-sufficiency; the highly interdependent, 'globalised' world of the first and second centuries slid into a much less wealthy, quasi-feudal world.

By the __dominate__ , the period when [Diocletian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian) (285) managed to stamp out the worst of the chaos, the economy was a shambles and — more important to the soldier-emperors who followed — it was very hard put to maintain the military that the empire depended on. Diocletian and many of his successors tried to set things straight in classic command-economy fashion; here a modern economist might have been able to tell an emperor that [comprehensive price controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_on_Maximum_Prices), forcing people into professions they don't want to be in for less wages than they want, and attempts to force producers to sell at uniform prices in defiance of local conditions don't work very well or for very long.

_that's slave prices on the upper right. A low skilled slave is around 25 denarii; just below a race horse is 100_ 

Diocletian (and several of his _dirigiste_ successors, particularly Julian) found it out the hard way. This policy accelerated the Roman world's slide into a localized, rural, and commodity-based economy — laying the foundations of feudalism and also greatly hampering the ability of the Roman state to defend itself.

Of course the whole thing relates to the problem of being stuck with a pure metal standard for money. Diocletian's edict is thought to have started as part of a larger scheme to get Roman citizens to accept a new fiat currency: a new bronze version of the old denarius that frankly contained no silver and was theoretically valued at 2/10,000ths of a pound of gold. The price fixing scheme was in part an effort to enforce a value for the new denarius -- one which ultimately failed to stick . Constantine effectively returned to 'the gold standard' by the end of his reign but Diocletian's heavy handed legacy remained strong, particularly in its efforts to keep tenant farmers bound to the land. One would hope that a modern economist could convince somebody in power that serfdom was not a good foundation for a prosperous society.

There's a lot of detailed things that would probably drive a modern economist crazy. Rome didn't have real limited-liability corporations, a regulated or insured banking business, intellectual property laws, or worker welfare beyond the grain dole in cities big enough to be afraid of riots. There were 'banks' of a sort, but they shaded off into loan-sharking and they were also not guaranteed. However the lack of government financial tools and the stubborn insistence of ordinary consumers on weight-of-metal as the real standard of value would make any modern economist end up looking like this fellow:

> [[Diocletian](http://www.forumancientcoins.com/NumisWiki/view.asp?key=Diocletian), Maximian, Constantius, and [Galerius](http://www.forumancientcoins.com/NumisWiki/view.asp?key=Galerius)] declare:
As we recall the wars which we have successfully fought, we must be grateful to the fortune of our state, second only to the immortal gods, for a tranquil world that reclines in the embrace of the most profound calm, and for the blessings of a peace that was won with great effort. That this fortune of our state be stabilized and suitably adorned is demanded by the law-abiding public and by the dignity and majesty of Rome. Therefore we, who by the gracious favor of the gods previously stemmed the tide of the ravages of barbarian nations by destroying them, must surround the peace which we established for eternity with the necessary defenses of justice.
If the excesses perpetrated by persons of unlimited and frenzied avarice could be checked by some self-restraint—this avarice which rushes for gain and profit with no thought for mankind; or if the general welfare could endure without harm this riotous license by which, in its unfortunate state, it is being very seriously injured every day, the situation could perhaps be faced with dissembling and silence, with the hope that human forbearance might alleviate the cruel and pitiable situation. But the only desire of these uncontrolled madmen is to have no thought for the common need. Among the unscrupulous, the immoderate, and the avaricious it is considered almost a creed to desist from plundering the wealth of all only when necessity compels them. Through their extreme need, moreover, some persons have become acutely aware of their most unfortunate situation, and can no longer close their eyes to it. Therefore we, who are the protectors of the human race, are agreed, as we view the situation, that decisive legislation is necessary, so that the long-hoped-for solutions which mankind itself could not provide may, by the remedies provided by our foresight, be vouchsafed for the general betterment of all.
We hasten, therefore, to apply the remedies long demanded by the situation, satisfied that no one can complain that our intervention with regulations is untimely or unnecessary, trivial or unimportant. These measures are directed against the unscrupulous, who have perceived in our silence of so many years a lesson in restraint but have been unwilling to imitate it. For who is so insensitive and so devoid of human feeling that he can be unaware or has not perceived that uncontrolled prices are widespread in the sales taking place in the markets and in the daily life of the cities? Nor is the uncurbed passion for profiteering lessened either by abundant supplies or by fruitful years.
It is our pleasure, therefore, that the prices listed in the subjoined schedule be held in observance in the whole of our Empire.
It is our pleasure that anyone who resists the measures of this statute shall be subject to a capital penalty for daring to do so. And let no one consider the statute harsh, since there is at hand a ready protection from danger in the observance of moderation. We therefore exhort the loyalty of all, so that a regulation instituted for the public [good](http://www.forumancientcoins.com/NumisWiki/view.asp?key=Good) may be observed with willing obedience and due scruple, especially as it is seen that by a statute of this kind provision has been made, not for single municipalities and peoples and provinces but for the whole world.
