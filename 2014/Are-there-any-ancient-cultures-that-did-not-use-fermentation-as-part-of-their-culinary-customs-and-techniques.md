Fermentation is pretty much universal, afaik, but use of fermentation specifically for alcohol is less so. Many groups around the world have low inherited tolerance for alcohol that might reflect low usage over time. In populous areas alcohol is an important method of decontaminating water; but many cultures do the same job with boiling (ie, tea) . 

Boil-first cultures often use alcohol as well - china, for example - but low alcohol metabolisation across a group is believed to be an indicator of low cultural use over long times (many thousands of years would be needed to have noticeable effects on population genetics ).
