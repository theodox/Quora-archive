“Race” is not a useful concept here. The Roman empire was a complex, multi-ethnic coalition stretching from Scotland to Syria, and from Sudan to the North Sea. The roster of emperors is testament to that: ethnic “Romans,” or even Italians, are actually a minority after the first century and a half. Although we know where a lot of the emperors came from, we rarely know their real “ethnicities” since the upper classes of the emperor were such a mixture of peoples (and since convention granted everybody names which sound eminently “Roman” to us).

The southern tier of the empire produced fewer emperors than the rest; the most fertile ground for emperors was the Balkans, where (not coincidentally) the Roman army’s biggest command centers lay.

The __[Severan dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severan_dynasty)__  of six emperors was __North African__ , with roots in the Punic/Berber culture of the region. Septimius Severus married a Syrian woman and the rest of the dynasty had close ties to Syria.

__[Macrinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus)__ ____ — who briefly interrupted the Severan dynasty — was another North African from what is today __Libya__ .

__[Philipus Arabus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_the_Arab)__  (who may or may not have been what we’d call an ethnic Arab) was a __Syrian__ .

__[Aemilianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aemilianus)__ ____ was either a __Moor or a Libyan__  (sources differ).

__[Maxentius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxentius)__ ’ mother was __Syrian__ .

__[Heraclius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclius#Origins)__ ____ was born in North Africa, but his family were __Persian/Armenians__  living in Cappadocia (southern Turkey).

Which of these count as “white” is an exercise best left to the reader, or maybe better just left alone.
