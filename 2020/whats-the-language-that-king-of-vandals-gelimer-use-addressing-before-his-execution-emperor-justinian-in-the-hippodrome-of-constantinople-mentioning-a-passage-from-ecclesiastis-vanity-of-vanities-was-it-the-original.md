# What's the language that King of Vandals Gelimer use, addressing before his execution Emperor Justinian, in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, mentioning a passage from Ecclesiastis: "Vanity of vanities"? Was it the original Hebrew, Latin or Hellenic?

The original source — [Procopius ](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/procop-wars4-9.asp)—- does not say. Most likely however it would have been Latin. We know he issued his coins in Latin:

_A coin of Gelimer, with the Latin legend D[ominus] N[oster] REX GELIMER_ 

… and by some twist of fate have what looks like a piece of Gelimer’s ceremonial silver: This piece, from the [Bibliotheque National de France](http://medaillesetantiques.bnf.fr/ws/catalogue/app/collection/record/ark:/12148/c33gbfs80), is inscribed GEILAMIR REX VANDALORVM ET ALANORVM

Despite their dubious reputation the Vandal kings did not try to extinguish Latin culture in Africa. Carthage had been the second city of Latin literature in the fifth century and the Hasdings — like the Amals in Italy — relied on the cooperation of local elites to manage the business of their new kingdom. Just as Theodoric had Boethius and Symmachus, the Vandals had locals like [Blossius Aemilius Dracontius](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Blossius-Aemilius-Dracontius) (who, like Boethius, ended up in jail: making use of the local elite does not necessarily mean trusting them). There was an active circle of Latin poets in the Vandal court; [Luxorius ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxorius_(poet))and [Flavius Felix](https://oxfordre.com/classics/classics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-2655) for example wrote admiring Latin poems addressed to Gelimer’s uncle Thrasamund — who also engaged in theological debates with [Fulgentius of Ruspe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgentius_of_Ruspe), in Latin.

As a small minority ruling over a much larger Latin speaking population, the Vandals were fast losing their language in the sixth century. We don’t have much Vandal textual material but it does clearly show the growing us of mixed Latin-Vandal names. There was evidently a mixed Vandal-Latin liturgy in the Vandal’s Arian churches, but only a couple of fragments survive today.

It is of course possible that Gelimer spoke his quote in Vandalic — unfortunately almost nothing of the Vandalic language survives. Our closest example would be Gothic (in fact, many anti-Vandal writers in Africa referred to the occupiers’ language as Gothic) but we [don’t have that portion of the Gothic Bible ](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-surviving-contemporary-written-accounts-of-the-Gothic-language/answer/Steve-Theodore)either.

We can’t quite be sure that the correct quote would be _vanitas vanitatum_ , _et omnia vanitas_ . That’s the current Latin, but it comes from Jerome’s translation which did exist in 535 but which would not really become dominant for a couple more centuries.
