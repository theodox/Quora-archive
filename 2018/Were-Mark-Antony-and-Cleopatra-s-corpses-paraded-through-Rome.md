No. Octavian (not yet “Augustus”) allowed them to be buried together in Egypt:

> … although vexed at the death of the woman [Cleopatra], he admired her lofty spirit; and he gave orders that her body should be buried with that of Antony in splendid and regal fashion. Her women also received honourable interment by his orders. When Cleopatra died she was forty years of age save one, had been queen for two and twenty of these, and had shared her power with Antony more than fourteen.

[Plutarch, Antony 86.4](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0007%3Achapter%3D86%3Asection%3D4)

The tombs have been lost for a long time; its likely that they were in the quarter of Alexandria that is now underwater although there’s an expedition looking for them in a graveyard from about the right time period west of Alexandria.
