To add to [Matt Riggsby](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matt-Riggsby)'s answer, there's also:

 [Cosmas Indicopleustes](http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962), a Greco-Egyptian merchant from Alexandria in the age of Justinian. Nowadays he's mostly (in-)famous for his unusual flat-earth cosmology -- which was widely mocked in his own day and throughout the Middle Ages -- but he was an astute observer of a number of destinations around the Indian Ocean from Ethiopia to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

[Pytheas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pytheas), a Greek merchant from Massilia who traveled around the British Isles and seems to have visited Scandinavia and the Baltic. He left the earliest written descriptions of polar ice and the midnight sun and is often believed to have described Iceland (aka 'utmost Thule').

[Hanno the Navigator ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanno_the_Navigator)was not a Roman, but he seems to have coasted Africa as far as modern Cameroon in the 5th century BC. There's another, less reliable story of an (unnamed) Phoenician expedition which circumnavigated Africa from the east even earlier. 

The Roman client-king and amateur naturalist [Juba II s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II)end expeditions to the Canary Islands and the island of Madeira, the farthest west of any Roman travels.
