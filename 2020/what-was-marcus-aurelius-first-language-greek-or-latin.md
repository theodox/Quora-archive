Marcus was a native Latin speaker, though like most upper-class Romans of his era he was fluent in Greek as well.

His family was had deep roots in the Latin-speaking lands of the empire. His paternal [grandfather ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Annius_Verus_(grandfather_of_Marcus_Aurelius))and [father ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Annius_Verus_(father_of_Marcus_Aurelius))were wealthy Roman aristocrats; though the family had originated in Italy it had moved to Spain in the first century. His mother’s family, were wealthy Italian nobles. Marcus’ father moved his own family back to Italy, and Marcus grew up in Rome.

His tutor and childhood mentor was [Marcus Cornelius Fronto,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Cornelius_Fronto) a rhetorician from Cirta in North Africa — today’s Constantine, Algeria. Fronto was a noted Latin author and rhetorician. His style placed emphasis on a precise native Latin vocabulary. Marcus in his late teens and early 20’s, Marcus studied with the Greek rhetorician [Herodes Atticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodes_Atticus) who, ironically, was noted for his dislike of Stoicism.

You can get a good sample of Marcus’ Latin from his [letters to Fronto](https://archive.org/stream/correspondenceof01fronuoft#page/66/mode/2up), several of which have survived.
