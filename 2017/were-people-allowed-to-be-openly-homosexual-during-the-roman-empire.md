Yes and no. Our categories don’t map onto the Roman world very well.

The primary rule was that a _respectable_  man could not be the passive partner in homosexual sex. Being the receiving partner in anal or oral sex was regarded as degrading to a man. A man was expected to act the “man’s part” : who was on the other end was less important. The Romans picked up the practice of pederasty from the Greeks, so boys were regarded as the most desirable objects of male-male desire; this emphasized the disparity in power in the relationship. The expected partners, in any case, would most likely be slaves or the low-born, for whom considerations of honor and reputation — or personal feelings, or even consent — did not matter. At least among the high-status individuals who dominate our records, relations between equals were rare and frowned upon.

The other important dimension was duty to the family. Failing to marry and reproduce was also regarded as a grave defect of character: even a man whose primary interest was in other men would be expected to marry and to father children (good examples would be the dictator [Sulla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla#Marriages_and_children), or emperor [Hadrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian#Final_years)). Among the upper classes there were intermittent moral panics about the failure of the nobility to reproduce: there were legal penalties (usually fines or limits on inheritance) intended to force respectable Romans to have children. Marriage was about the continuation of the clan, not primarily about romance or sexual satisfaction, since the Roman world was amply provided with brothels and slaves.

The duty of reproduction also extended to women. A woman’s duty was to have children, just as a man’s was to father them. Discussions of lesbianism are much less common in Rome than they are in Greece, where the sexes were much more segregated — Roman morality was typically obsessed with female adultery not female-female desire.

Legally, it’s not really clear what interest the state took in same-sex matters. The state didn’t recognized gay marriages. There are a few surviving accounts of men celebrating marriage ceremonies with each other — but all of them are either satire or political slander. Some literary sources imply that the Roman fondness for [adoption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_in_ancient_Rome) was a way for older lovers to provide for their younger partners by adopting them. The [only surviving law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Scantinia) regulating sexual behavior is ambiguously phrased and was not widely applied. The legal term _stuprum_ , literally “violation” or “dishonor” is not given a clear definition in our surviving sources, but at least in theory the crime of _stuprum_  carried the death penalty. As with Roman attitudes in general, though, it is clear that the law was based on the status of the receiving partner: _stuprum_  could only be committed against a free citizen. The state had no interest at all in what was done with a slave or a prostitute.
