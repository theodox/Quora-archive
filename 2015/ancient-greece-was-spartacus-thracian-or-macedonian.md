He was a Thracian according to [Plutarch](http://www.livius.org/so-st/spartacus/spartacus_t01.html) and other ancient writers. This is borne out by his name: Sparadokos is a common name among Thracians. There were several kings of Thrace who bore that name; this coin is a coin of Sparadokos I from about 430 BC (the 'S' is at 9 o'clock and it reads clockwise).

The name is also found as far to the north and east as modern-day Crimea in the kingdom of the Crimean Bosporus so he could have come from anywhere between, modern Odessa and the modern Republic of Macedonia. The historic center of Thrace was between the Hebrus river and the kingdom of Macedon, so roughly southern Bulgaria and modern Macedonia. Plutarch also says he was cultured and 'almost like a Greek', and he had fought as a Roman auxiliary soldier before his enslavement : both of which suggests he was fairly well off before his misfortunes.
