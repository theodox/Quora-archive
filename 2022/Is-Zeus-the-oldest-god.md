No.

Here’s one version of his family tree (this one seems to be based on Hesiod’s [Theogony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theogony), one of the oldest efforts to lay things out systematically. As you can see Zeus is the son [Cronus](https://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanKronos.html) and [Rhea](https://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanisRhea.html); their parents were [Uranus](https://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Ouranos.html) (“Sky”) and [Gaia](https://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Gaia.html) (who was also Uranus’ mother… it’s complicated, but there weren’t many choices around!). Gaia came from the union of [Aether ](https://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Aither.html)(“Starry sky”, or maybe “Space”) and [Hemera ](https://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Hemera.html)(“Day”). These were the children of [Erebus ](https://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Erebos.html)(“Darkness”) and [Nyx ](https://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Nyx.html)(“Night”) . The whole thing starts with [Chaos ](https://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Khaos.html)(hard to translate — maybe “Air”, or maybe “Condensation”) and Nyx.

This would put Zeus as a seventh generation Deity.
