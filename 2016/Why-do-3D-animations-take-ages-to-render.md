There’s an old adage in CG:

_Ordinary renders take 5 minutes_ 

_Fancy renders take an hour_ 

_Really fancy renders run overnight_ 

This has been true since the early 90’s, even though the amount of computing power available to todays’s CG artists is easily 30,000 times greater than it was back then. The limits aren’t technological at this point (after all, a video game renders the screen 60 times every second with all sorts of nice effects (even faster if you’re a member of the PC Master Race with a jacked-up gaming rig). Five minutes about the most anybody voluntarily tolerates when trying to iterate on something. An hour is long enough to go get lunch, so you can work all morning, kick off a render, and go grab a burger without feeling like you missed something. And overnight is about as long as anybody can stand to wait to see the results of their last button push. What you can _accomplish_  has changed a lot in those time frames - but the patience of CG artists has not.
