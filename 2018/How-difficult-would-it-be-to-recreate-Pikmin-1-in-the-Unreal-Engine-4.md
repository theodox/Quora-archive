From a tech standpoint it would fairly simple. The short sightlines and predictable asset loading patterns are _exactly_ what the Unreal Engine likes, you would not need to really modify the engine in any important way. Given how much horsepower a modern PC — or even a decent phone — has relative to a GameCube, you could easily match the graphics of the original game. On a PC, anyway, you’d probably be able to add some touches like depth of field which would complement the sense of scale; the ambient occlusion that comes standard with UE would also be a marked improvement on the original.

The biggest production challenge would be animation. A lot of the charm of the original is the level very squashy-stretchy, exaggerated animations. Good animators — especially the kind that can work closely with designers to make sure that the gameplay and the visuals are in sync — are the rarest and most precious commodity in game dev.* I would only tackle a project like this with a great animator and a gameplay designer who was very good at timing and controller-feel working together.

Legally, of course, you’d have a very tough nut to crack. Nintendo is very protective of their IPs. I think a “spiritual successor” would work but for any commercial product “recreation” is going to get you in trouble.

_* Except for high-end graphics programmers. But a Pikmin clone in UE probably won’t need a dedicated graphics guru._
