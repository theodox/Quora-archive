# In the 1st-century B.C., how big would a Mediterranean settlement (outside of Greece and Italy) need to be to be reasonably assured of finding someone who spoke Greek or Latin?

__Greek__ 

Most places within sight of the Mediterranean would have some idea who the Greeks were. At that point in time the demise of Carthage gave the Greeks the same kind of access west of Sicily that they had long had east of there.

Still, that wouldn’t mean that Greek was universally spoken as a trade language. From Cyrenaica east, any settlement large enough to justify the occasional visit of a trading ship would probably have some kind of pidgin-Greek speaker, since Greek shipping had been a familiar sight there for centuries. In the west, the same would be true for Sicily, southern Gaul, Corsica and Sardinia. But in Iberia, Algeria or Morocco the penetration will still not have been very good — the surviving Punic cities like Utica or Hippo continued trading in those traditionally Carthaginian areas, and Latin would end up becoming the _lingua franca_  of the western Mediterranean.

Even in places which were not big trade destinations, Greek was frequently the language of government and law. Smaller countries like Thrace, and big imperial possessions like Egypt were administered by Greek speaking bureaucrats even when the population did not speak Greek. There were exceptions — Jews in Judea, Phoenicians in the Levant — but the literate classes of many smaller language communities depended on Greek.

So, in the east anything much bigger than a hamlet probably had at least one or two people who could get by in pidgin Greek. In North Africa or Iberia it would probably be a sizeable town, one big enough to have attracted regular visits from Greek traders in the two or three generations since the fall of Carthage opened the sea-lanes to the west. Any place big enough to register on a modern map of the area probably fits that bill, but any place much smaller than that probably does not.

__Latin__ 

Latin was only starting its life as the major language of the western Mediterranean. Outside of Italy, the spread of Latin will have been very closely related to the spread of the Roman military. The line between Roman garrisons and Roman settlements was very fuzzy, since the Romans planted colonies as a way of keeping an eye on the places they conquered — most Roman colonies were settlements of veterans, and many of them occupied sites that had once been considered of military importance.

So, at this point in time you’d find nuclei of Latin speakers clustering in current and former strategic locations: along river lines and at river crossings, near important cities that might be politically sensitive, and along the lines of the growing Roman road network. In this period most of the colonies were in the west. A few would start cropping up in the east in the last half of the century — Caesar, for example, planted a Roman colony on the site of Corinth not long before his assassination.

Whether they were active military encampments or ostensibly civilian colonies, these outposts would be the prime movers in the diffusion of Latin. Farmers and merchants from nearby towns and villages would pick up the language in order to sell to the newcomers.

Farther up the social scale, ambitious local notables would pick it up to further their ambitions in politics or the military. Sometimes this was involuntary — it was Roman practice to bring the sons on important former enemies to Rome for “education” and to serve as guarantees of good behavior. But more of them were either career military men or adventureres. In the first century Iberia, Numidia and Morocco were providing large numbers of auxiliaries to the Roman army and these would all return home with rough and ready Latin.

In both ends of the Mediterranean, large settlements would also have a number of Latin-speaking merchants and their business partners. Spain in particular, which had been in the Roman orbit since the end of the Second Punic War, had strong business connections with Roman world (Caesar’s career, for example, was financed in large part by the wealthy Hispanian financier [Balbus)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Balbus_(consul)). However there were Roman traders in the east as well — there’s plenty of evidence for Romans in commercial centers like Alexandria, Rhodes and Delos in the first century BC. You can get a sense of the scale of their presence from the fact that when Mithradates of Pontus[ unleashed a pogrom against Roman traders in Asia Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_Vespers), there were somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000 victims. Romans operating in the east in this period probably did most of their business in Greek, which was and would remain the economic language of the eastern Mediterranean — but they were common enough that finding one in a commercial city would not pose a serious problem. Smaller towns would be less likely.

The Latinization of the west was just beginning to accelerate in the first century BC. In this period Latin speech was a kind of archipelago all across the Roman world. Within a hundred and fifty years or so, however,it would be easier to find Latin speakers than to avoid them.
