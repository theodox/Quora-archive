# Did the ancient Greeks and/or Romans view the Trojan War (as described in the Iliad) as an actual historical event? When did it come to be seen as fictional?

The historicity of the Trojan War was accepted pretty broadly in antiquity. The Greeks did not have a written literature older than the Iliad — they had no record of their own or other people’s lives that was as old or as detailed or as authoritative. There were, however, many variant traditions as well — the so-called “[Epic Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Cycle)” — which involved many of the same events and characters. While that created plenty of confusion and contradictions which different scholars tried to resolve, it also reinforced the overall impression that the core subject matter was basically factual.

That said, the ancients were very aware of how quickly the line between history and myth could blur, and they were certainly willing to argue about the particulars of any given story. Plutarch’s introduction to his [Life of Theseus ](http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html)is a good example of the mild form of skepticism that was common in antiquity:

> [As geographers] crowd into the edges of their maps parts of the world which they do not know about, adding notes in the margin to the effect, that beyond this lies nothing but the sandy deserts full of wild beasts, unapproachable bogs, Scythian ice, or a frozen sea, so in this work of mine, in which I have compared the lives of the greatest men with one another, after passing through those periods which probable reasoning can reach to and real history find a footing in, I might very well say of those that are farther off: "Beyond this there is nothing but prodigies and fictions, the only inhabitants are the poets and inventors of fables; there is no credit, or certainty any farther."

However the centrality of the Iliad in Greek tradition meant that nobody denied the existence of the Trojan War, not matter how much they might be willing to debate a particular incident or to doubt some of the more fantastic elements of the tale. [Thucydides](http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.1.first.html) — an arch-rationalist — didn’t succumb to the glamor of the Trojan War as related by Homer, but his critique assumes that the story is true in its outlines:

> There is also another circumstance that contributes not a little to my conviction of the weakness of ancient times. Before the Trojan war there is no indication of any common action in Hellas, nor indeed of the universal prevalence of the name; on the contrary, before the time of Hellen, son of Deucalion, no such appellation existed, but the country went by the names of the different tribes, in particular of the Pelasgian….. The best proof of this is furnished by Homer. Born long after the Trojan War, he nowhere calls all of them by that name, nor indeed any of them except the followers of Achilles from Phthiotis, who were the original Hellenes: in his poems they are called Danaans, Argives, and Achaeans. He does not even use the term barbarian, probably because the Hellenes had not yet been marked off from the rest of the world by one distinctive appellation. It appears therefore that the several Hellenic communities, comprising not only those who first acquired the name, city by city, as they came to understand each other, but also those who assumed it afterwards as the name of the whole people, were before the Trojan war prevented by their want of strength and the absence of mutual intercourse from displaying any collective action.

The main exceptions were people who had philosophical reasons for disputing Homer’s account. Plato, for example, was [famously hostile to Homer](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-rhetoric/) despite admiring his skills as poet, because he believed that Homer’s “lies” taught bad life-lessons. The Stoics interpreted Homer allegorically, which meant that the historicity of the events wasn’t something they cared about one way or another. Aristotle regards Homer as a poet first, facts be damned: “Above all,” he says admiringly, “Homer has taught the others the proper way of telling lies.”

The slightly-skeptical approach to Homer was the majority view all the way down to the 18th century. In the late 1600’s [Gianbattista Vico](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vico/) revived both the historical and allegorical approaches to Homer. This lead in one direction to a renewed interest in Homer as a historical document (this was around the same time that many other works of “epic history,” such as the _Nibelungenlied_  or _Ossian_  were the subject of intense interest in Europe). Vico regarded Homer as important evidence for the prehistory of “heroic” pre-political societies.

However Vico’s admiration for Homer as an allegorist also stimulated a reaction at a time when historians were becoming enamored of hyper-critical reading of ancient sources. The biggest blow to Homer’s authority was struck by [Friedrich August Wolf](http://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/viewFile/7001/5017) in the mid 1700’s, who not only denied the historicity of Homer’s texts — he denied the existence of Homer as an individual ([a debate which still goes on ](https://www.quora.com/What-Who-inspired-Homerus-in-the-main)today). From the middle of the 18th to the late 19th century, most scholarship regarded the Trojan War as essentially a fairy-tale. However the archeological work done by [Heinrich Schliemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Schliemann) at [what we now believe to be] Troy and Mycenae reset that trend. New archeological material has definitely made the case for [some kind of historicity](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Greek-society-described-in-Homers-epics-post-Mycenean-rather-than-Mycenean) far more compelling, although very few people in the field today would take “Homer” — assuming he existed — with the literal enthusiasm of Schliemann. Genteel skepticism of the kind that would be familiar to Plutarch rules the day again.
