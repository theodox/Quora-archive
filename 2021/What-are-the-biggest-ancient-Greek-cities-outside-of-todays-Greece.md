It’s a bit tricky to know how to count [Constantinople](http://i/), todays’ Istanbul. The city was “re-founded” in the 4th century by Roman emperor Constantine — there had been [a modest Greek city on the same spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantium) for nearly a thousand years before emperor chose the spot as a new capital for the Eastern Roman Empire. For the next millennium Constantinople would be the imperial capital and, for much of that time the largest city in Europe (if not the world) . At it’s late-Roman peak in the 6th century, Constantinople was almost as big as Rome: the highest estimates put its population at close to a million.

After Constantinople, the two titans of the overseas Greek world were [Alexandria ](https://www.worldhistory.org/alexandria/)(in Egypt) and [Seleucia ](http://lear dns cache)(in Syria) — the capitals of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires which emerged from the breakup of Alexander’s empire. Both of these were monstrous by ancient standards, more than 600,000 people apiece at their peak. Neither was exclusively “Greek” in practice: although they both were founded and operated along Greek lines, each attracted a substantial population of the local people.

Rounding out the Hellenistic megalopolis list is [Antioch](https://www.worldhistory.org/Antiochia/) in Syria — another foundation of the Seleucid empire which peaked early in the Roman era, probably close to half a million people (again, with a substantial non-Greek component).

Outside the cities created by Hellenistic kings and Roman emperors the leader is [Syracuse](https://www.worldhistory.org/syracuse/), in Sicily. Between roughly 400 and 300 BC it was probably right after Athens in the Greek population sweepstakes.
