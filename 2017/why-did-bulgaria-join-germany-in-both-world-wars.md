There’s excellent detail in the other answers, so I’ll just add a couple of strategic notices:

In the runup to the first war, the land route from Central Europe through the Balkans to Turkey and thence “the east” was a central concern of German strategists. Recognizing the likelihood of war with England, the Germans were intensely interested in access to India (achievable through Persia overland or the Persian Gulf). During the war, the Kaiser even bankrolled a [plan to foment a Jihad against the British Raj](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/museums/11022199/Germanys-Grand-WW1-Jihad-Experiment.html)*, but even before the war German interest was intense, taking concrete form in the [Berlin-Baghdad Railway…](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/de-berlin-baghdad-3.htm) which ran right through Sofia.

The Germans could not precisely compel Bulgarian assistance — but the Bulgarian link was definitely an important, precisely calibrated factor in their calculations. The isolation of Bulgaria following the Balkan wars made it possible for the Germans to manage the tricky business of pulling the Bulgarians into an alliance that also included their old enemies, the Turks — but the lack of local allies and (as [Harold](https://www.quora.com/profile/Harold-249) points out) the inability of the Western allies to offer a good deal gave the Bulgarians a push in the direction of Berlin.

The situation in the second war had much to do with the results of the first: in particular, they Bulgarians wanted back territory lost to Rumania at Versailles. However it didn’t hurt that Bulgaria had become authoritarian around the same time as Germany: a [1934 coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_of_1934) created a small-f fascist regime on the Italian model. [Boris III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_III_of_Bulgaria) co-opted the leadership of the coup (which began as a republican, not a monarchist movement) and effectively ran the country; like many European strongmen he was more afraid of Communism than committed to democracy or constitutionalism.

Boris was not, however, an ardent Nazi by any means: he never contributed troops to Hitler’s war against Russia — and more importantly, he [resisted German demands for the deportation of Bulgaria’s Jews](http://www.aish.com/ho/i/The_Rescue_of_Bulgarian_Jewry.html).
