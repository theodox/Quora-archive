The [Montefortino helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montefortino_helmet) dominated the armies of the Republic from about 300 BC down to the first decades of the empire. It’s really just a fairly simple pot-helmet with cheek flaps and, usually, an attachment for a crest of some kind.

In the first century the same basic design added a neck protector and a reinforced brow ridge, creating the [classic legionary helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_helmet)* you see most often in movies. There were actually several sub-families of this type, but they are usually grouped broadly into “Italic” and “Gallic” types based on their provenance. Generally the Gallic types are better made and decorated, the Italic types are mass produced and simpler. The neck-guarded family of helmets was in use from the first through the third century or so.

After the third century the dominant design influence was Persian helmets. [Late-Roman helmets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Roman_ridge_helmet) have a peaked profile rather than the simpler, hemispheric style of the Montefortino and it’s descendants; they were constructed out of four or six sections instead of single solid piece. Usually they retained the hinged cheek plates but drop the neck protection of the second and third century models. Nose guards became common as well.

This style of helmet was very successful — it’s familiar to many of us as a “Viking” or “Anglo-Saxon” helmet because its longevity meant that it was common all the way through to the ninth century or so.

[This reenactor site](http://www.imperium-romana.org/roman-helmets.html) gives a good rundown of the main Republican and early-imperial types over time.



A type that was never very common was this:

Despite its popularity in movies, that hinged brow design is basically not historical. There are a few examples like this:

The few examples tend to be parade-ground items, based on [a Roman idea of what a classical Greek-era helmet would look like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_helmet). They do show up in Roman art — but hardly ever in archaeology.

_These are Praetorian guards. They do wear Hollywood style Attic helmets — however these are parade-ground soldiers: the Praetorians from the time of this image were primary an internal-security force stationed in Rome, not field troops._
