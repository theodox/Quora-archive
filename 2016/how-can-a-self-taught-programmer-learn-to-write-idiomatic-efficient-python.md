I'm personally also partial to this one Jack Diederich:



Which has some useful cautions for things that frequently afflict intermediate-level coders.

If you are interested in performance optimization a, [PerformanceTips ](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips)is a good simple starter.
