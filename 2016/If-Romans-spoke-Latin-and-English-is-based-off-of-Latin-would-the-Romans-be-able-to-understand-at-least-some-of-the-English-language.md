# If Romans spoke Latin, and English is based off of Latin, would the Romans be able to understand at least some of the English language?

They would guess individual words - but only a few.

English owes much more to Germanic languages than to Latin, even though it picked up a lot of Latin-based vocabulary from French and from people inventing new words in the 18th and 19th centuries. Latin doesn’t really use word order to distinguish parts of a sentence - it uses word endings which we don’t bother with anymore — so they’d have a very hard time knowing how to parse our sentences even if they picked up the occasional noun or verb.
