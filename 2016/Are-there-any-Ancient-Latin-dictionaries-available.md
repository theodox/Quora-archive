For non-specialists [LatDict ](http://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/)is pretty simple and quick to use.

If your Latin is a bit more advanced, the online version of [Lewis and Short](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.04.0059) is good and has links to lots of examples of the words in context.
