Not that we’re aware of. His first name indicates that his family got Roman citizenship under Claudius or maybe Nero. A late tradition puts his birthplace in the city of Ptolemais Hermiou (Al Manshah) which might explain the name. He might also have been a Hellenized Egyptian whose family had adopted ‘Ptolemy’ as they later adopted ‘Claudius.’

The name itself is a bit odd: Greeks didn’t use family names the way we do; the more usual styles would have been either ‘Claudius son of so-and-so’ or ‘Claudius of city X’, or perhaps both at the same time. Greeks who adopted Roman ways used the same three-name system as Romans (‘Gaius Julius Caesar’). Ptolemy’s recorded name, as a two-part hybrid with a Greek and a Latin half, doesn’t match either.
