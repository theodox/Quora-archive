There’s a lot of questions packed into one here.

Basically, all citizen males in Sparta were soldiers — and nothing else. They were forbidden to practice any other trade; there no blacksmiths, no architects, no accountants, only soldiers. All other economic activity was done by [helots ](https://www.quora.com/How-long-did-the-Spartans-have-slaves/answer/Steve-Theodore)— basically, serfs — or by [Perioeci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioeci), a privileged class of non-citizens who were responsible for industry, crafts and trade.

The full Spartans (known as the _Spartiates_ , or _homoioi,_ “the equals”) lived off the proceeds of a kind of feudal manor — allotted to each citizen by the state. Helots worked the land as tenant farmers and supported their masters with a portion of their produce. It seems like some Spartans took an active hand in managing their farms —- you could imagine it kind of like a 19th century British lord trying to coordinate the work of his tenants —- but the primary obligation of a Spartan was to stay in training for a military call-up. The real enemy against which the Spartans prepared was not other cities, however; it was the possibility of a helot rebellion. The helots outnumbered the Spartiates very heavily, at least by a ratio of 7:1, and only constant vigilance and repression kept the Spartans on top.

The [Spartan educational system ](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-training-regimen-of-a-spartan-soldier-like)was designed to produce strong, obedient, self-reliant soldiers. This started literally at birth: every male child was inspected for evidence of “unfitness” and those that were found inadequate were killed (many other Greeks practiced infanticide as well: the unique aspect of the Spartan system was that the decision was made by the state, and not the family). From 7–17 the boys underwent a rigorous training (living away from home in a communal _agélai_ or “herd”), learning physical skills and military discipline. Reading and writing were also taught; the Spartan way of life was also taught through oral instruction by older citizens who encouraged debate — within limits —and taught the famous Spartan wit as well: despite their grim reputation the Spartans were famous for their dry sense of humor, and they competed to find the pithiest ways of expressing themselves.

From around 17 to 20, Spartan boys were expected to take an older male as _erastes:_ a term that means something between “mentor” and “lover” (by Greek standards, the Spartan version of this relationship was relatively chaste, at least in theory). The _erastes_  was an important bridge to adult socializing and responsibilities for the adolescent male.

Spartan girls had a somewhat similar track, though unlike the boys they were not removed from the home early. Girls’ education included a heavy physical component — it was thought that this would contribute to the birth of healthier children — but it also included reading and writing. Spartan women were expected to be much more self reliant than the women in most Greek cities, particularly as the management of a Spartan manor would fall on the women when the men were away on campaign. Sparta also turned a blind eye to Spartan women who took ‘temporary husbands’ when their real husbands were away at war: thanks in part to frequent conflicts, and in part to their aggressive eugenics program, the Spartans always had trouble keeping up their numbers so an extra child was supposed to be welcome — assuming, of course, that the father was another Spartan and not a helot.
