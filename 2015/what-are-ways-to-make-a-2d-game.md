If you have any programming background, Unity is as good as the other answers say.

If you're a beginner you might want to get familiar with graphical game making tools like [Scratch ](http://scratch.mit.edu/)or [Multimedia Fusion](http://www.clickteam.com/multimedia-fusion-2) or [GameSalad](http://gamesalad.com/)
