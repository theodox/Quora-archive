The declaration of 'treason' wasn't anything like an impartial judicial proceeding: it was a smart political maneuver by Antony's enemies. Antony made the mistake of basing his power in the east, close to the money (Egypt) but far from Rome and what was left of the Senate. Octavian stayed in Rome and skillfully used Antony's 'foreign' tastes and dalliance with the 'alien' Cleopatra to turn Roman public opinion against him. Antony was certainly making deals with foreign powers on his own authority, but that was no different from what Caesar, Pompey and many other successful Roman generals had done before; the difference was that Octavian (hardly a stickler for the traditional powers of the Senate in other affairs) decided to use this as a pretext when the [Second Triumvirate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Triumvirate) fell apart.

This was mostly a manufactured worry -- Caesar dallied with Cleopatra and even brought her to Rome and it was not regarded as dangerous -- but it was a successful PR campaign which Octavian engineered to delegitimize Antony. Plus, Antony had also made a lot of enemies among what was left of the old Senatorial class by showing a lot of even more contempt for due process than the other triumvirs, and by demanding the death of Cicero as part of his original power-sharing deal with Octavian.
