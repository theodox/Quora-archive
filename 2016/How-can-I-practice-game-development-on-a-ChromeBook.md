On the intro level, [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) from MIT is a great introduction to game development using a browser-based graphical scripting environment. It's not 'real' programming (ie, little or no text-based coding) but it's a great way to get familiar with the way computers can play game. 

If you're already a coder, you could try [BabylonJS](http://doc.babylonjs.com/), a web-GL based game engine that runs in a browser. On a chromebook you'll have a hard time getting access to the usual C++/C#, DirectX/OpenGL tools so this might be the best bet. You can supplement it with [clara.io](https://clara.io/), a browser based 3d modeller.
