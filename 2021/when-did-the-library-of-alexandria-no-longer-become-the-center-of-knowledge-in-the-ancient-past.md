If you need a _hard_ line, it’s some time between August of 48 BC and January of 47.

Julius Caesar was trapped in Alexandria, surrounded by a much larger army loyal to Cleopatra’s brother, Ptolemy XIII and her sister, Arsinoe IV. There was a good deal of close-range urban fighting between the Roman and Egyptian forces. Part of the fighting led to a fire in the cities dockyards, which spread to the neighborhood of the Museum and severely damaged or destroyed it. Caesarian sources at the time are pretty quiet about the destruction, though no visitor to the city after this time ever speaks of the great library again. The most definitive statement comes a good long time after:

> an enormous quantity of books, nearly seven hundred thousand volumes, was either acquired or written in Egypt under the kings known as Ptolemies; but these were all burned during the sack of the city in our first war with Alexandria, not intentionally or by anyone's order, but accidentally by the auxiliary soldiers

Aulus Gellius, _[Noctes Atticae, 7.17](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/gellius/7*.html)_ 

However the hard line is really not the important one.

By Caesar’s day, the library’s glory days were long past; the collection of scrolls might have still been together but the scholarly institution that brought together the brightest and most ambitious minds in the Greek world has been dead for a century.

The library was founded in the early years of the Ptolemaic kingdom; it’s most generous patron was [Ptolemy II Philladelphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_II_Philadelphus) who preceded Caesar by about two centuries. But, by Caesar’s day, the Ptolemaic monarchy which had created the institution was a shambles. The early, culturally conscious Ptolemies gave way to a long series of inept and venal rulers, more fond of fratricide and civil wars than literary patronage. In particular [Ptolemy VIII Physcon’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_VIII_Physcon) unpleasant reign marked a turning point: his violent takeover led to the exile of many scholars, including the head librarian [Aristarchus of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samothrace). To replace the respected scholar he appointed the chief of his personal guards. Other, later Ptolemies appointed political pals rather than scholars to the head of the library. Rhodes and Athens became more important centers of education and scholarship while the perennially broke royal family concentrated more on internecine feuds than on the support of learning.

So, you can say that after about the middle of the second century BC Alexandria lost it’s place as the epicenter of Greek learning. The memory of the glory days never quite faded: emperor Claudius appointed a librarian (his court astrologer) to preside over a “library,” but it was mostly as a political sinecure for friends and supporters (a contemporary called the place a school for parasites, “whom it is a disgrace even to mention” and a later writer described it as “a dining-table in Egypt to which are invited the most distinguished men of all countries.”
