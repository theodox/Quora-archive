I think you’ve got the names confused.

[Nefertiti ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertiti)is a queen from the early end of the New Kingdom — she was the wife of the heretic Pharoah Akhenaten, and the stepmother of the boy who would be King Tut. All this around 1350 BC.

The last (native) pharoah is [Nectanebo II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectanebo_II), who was defeated by the Persians and driven into exile in 342 BC. We don’t know his fate after that, though it’s likely he died in exile — when Alexander the Great defeated the Persians in turn in 332 BC, Nectanebo did not resurface. Patriotic Egyptians did believe, however, that Nectanebo was actually Alexander’s father — an unlikely, but comforting story.
