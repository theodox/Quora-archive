# How did Romans count years before the founding of Rome? I know they counted years from the founding (ab urbe condita), but what did they call the years before it?

Generally wouldn’t have felt the need.

Even in their own imaginations, the foundation of Rome was lost in the mists of a mostly-mythological past. The neatest statement of the idea is Plutarch’s introduction to his parallel biographies of Theseus and Romulus:

> Just as geographers, Sosius, crowd on to the outer edges of their maps the parts of the earth which elude their knowledge, with explanatory notes that "What lies beyond is sandy desert without water and full of wild beasts," or "blind marsh," or "Scythian cold," or "frozen sea," so in the writing of my Parallel Lives, now that I have traversed those periods of time which are accessible to probable reasoning and which afford basis for a history dealing with facts, I might well say of the earlier periods: "What lies beyond is full of marvels and unreality, a land of poets and fabulists, of doubt and obscurity."

Before the founding of the city Rome (dated by ancient tradition to 753 BC) Roman tradition was even sketchier than it was for the mostly legendary (and famously ill-documented) Roman kingdom. There was a sort of sketchy family tree which connected Romulus’ and Remus’ mother [Rhea Silvia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_Silvia) back to the Trojan refugees who arrived in Italy with Aeneas (in what would have been 1177 BC if you use the traditional Greek dating). The most elaborate version of that story had 14 generations of shadowy names. But it was really a matter of traditional genealogy, not history — a collection of “begats” interspersed with a few folk tales.

If you really wanted to talk about the prehistory of Roman in a very precise way you’d have a hard time: the standard Greco-Roman “reference” chronology was Greek [Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad) dating system — however that only went back to the first Olympiad in 776 BC. Earlier than that you’d just have to lay out your calculations about why so-and-so lived so many years before the founding of the city.

However this would not, in practice, have felt like much a problem. Serial dating systems did not become routine until much later — the first widespread system which really resembled a modern numbered year was the [Seleucid empire’s calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_era), which began in 312 BC and was still in use (in the Jewish diaspora) until the 19th century. There’s much more detail on the unsystematic nature of ancient dating in [this answer](https://www.quora.com/If-you-asked-a-Roman-in-30-AD-what-year-was-it-what-would-he-she-answer/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=3c0c021e&srid=zLvM).
