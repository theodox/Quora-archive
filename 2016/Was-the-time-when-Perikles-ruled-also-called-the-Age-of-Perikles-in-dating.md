Athenian dating was by [eponymous archons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eponymous_archon) — things were dated according to the name of the chief magistrate: “In the month of Boedromion when Callicles was archon” or something like that would be the usual formula. As you can imagine this was somewhat confusing, especially since there was a finite supply of Greek personal names. It was made more complex because the Athenian calendar wasn’t very accurate, and they had to tinker with it constantly to keep it in line with the solar year. Pericles was never the year-archon, although he was a _strategos._ 

In Pericles’ day the later system of dating by [Olympiads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad) hadn’t yet come into use. In later Greek history people could, if needed convert their local years into part of the 4-year cycle of the Olympic games (starting 776 BC) which reduced the confusion between multiple repeats of the same name and different calendars. It was never very precise, however; the Roman calendar — at least, after Caesar’s reforms— was much better.

It was a messy system that produced a lot of confusion (there were multiple calendars inside Athens for civic and religious purposes - and the calendars in neighboring cities were completely different too. It’s a big headache for historians. A good reference for the whole thing is [Chronology of the Ancient World](http://www.amazon.com/Chronology-Ancient-World-Aspects-Greek/dp/0500271518/ref=sr_1_12?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1464276272&sr=1-12&keywords=elias+bickerman) by Elias Bickerman.
