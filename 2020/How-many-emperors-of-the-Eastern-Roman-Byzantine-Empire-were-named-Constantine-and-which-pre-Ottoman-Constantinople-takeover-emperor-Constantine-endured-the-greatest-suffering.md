You’d expect there were 11, since the Last Emperor was [Constantine XI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_XI_Palaiologos).

On the other hand you might actually drop the first three, since Constatine I was sole emperor (with no colleague in the west), and Constantine II was never sole emperor of the east (he co-ruled with [Constantius_II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantius_II)) and Constantine III didn’t actually use that title (he ruled as Heraclius II Constantine) which would leave you 8. However you might need to add one for [Heraklonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraklonas), who actually ruled as Constantine Heraclius.

Out of the many Constantines, [number VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_VI) had it pretty rough: he rose to the throne as a child under his domineering mother, [Irene_of_Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_of_Athens). They played out an Oedipal struggle in the fine old Roman tradition of Nero and Agrippina, which culminated in Irene’s supporters gouging out Constantine’s eyes in 797. He disappeared after that — it’s not even clear when exactly he died, though it was before 805. It’s unlikely that his last years were pleasant — though, to be fair, he’d done roughly the same thing to one of his uncles so it’ hard to be too sympathetic.

Second place goes to Heraklonas (aka Constantine Heraclius) who was deposed after four months and had his nose cut off before dying in exile.

It’s stuff like this that[ gives “byzantine” it’s modern meaning.](https://www.quora.com/Was-the-Byzantine-Empire-actually-byzantine-If-so-how/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=4b310bb1&srid=zLvM)
