Numbers-wise, non-Italians are in the majority. Thus, it’s easier to point out the landmarks.

The first non-Italian emperor was [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan) (reigned 98–117) his family was originally Italian but had settled in Hispania. [Hadrian’s ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian)(117–138) background was similar. [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius)’ family were also from the Italian-derived aristocracy of Hispania but he himself was born and raised in Rome.

After [Septimius Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus) (reigned 193–211) the only Italians are [Trebonianus Gallus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebonianus_Gallus) (251–253) and [Tacitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Claudius_Tacitus) (275–276).

There are a couple of dubious cases: [Valentinian III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentinian_III) was born in Italy but his father was, like so many later emperors, from the Balkans. [Libius Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libius_Severus) was a Lucanian, but his reign was never recognized by the eastern empire.

So anybody before Severus (excluding Trajan and Hadrian) is Italian. Then add in Gallus and Tacitus, along with Valentinian and Libius Severus if you choose. That would be 22 to 24 of the [85–100 emperors.](https://www.quora.com/How-many-Roman-emperors-were-there/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=5b9b4470&srid=zLvM)
