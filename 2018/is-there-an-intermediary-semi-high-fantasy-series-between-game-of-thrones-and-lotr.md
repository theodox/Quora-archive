# Is there an intermediary semi-high fantasy series between Game of Thrones and LOTR? Rather than extremely black and white people or extremely morally ambiguous people, we have more believable characters? Characters are more like real life people.

A lot of [Gene Wolfe’](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_all_1?ie=UTF8&text=Gene+Wolfe&search-alias=books&field-author=Gene+Wolfe&sort=relevancerank)s books fit this bill, although (apart from the [The Wizard Knight series)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011M9QUJ2/ref=series_rw_dp_sw) most of his work technically sci-fi rather than fantasy. The [New Sun ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AXZVO38/ref=series_rw_dp_sw)series and the [Book of the Long Sun](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016QBBNWU/ref=series_rw_dp_sw) both show a rich collection of motives and perspectives beyond generic “good” and “evil” without descending entirely into self-interested maneuverings; both have a fantastic feel although they are wrapped around sci-fi conceits.

Glenn Cook’s [Black Company](http://amzn.to/2DSnjp5) series is on the darker side of the spectrum, but it also includes some legitimate shades-of-gray fiction among the backstabbing and betrayals.
