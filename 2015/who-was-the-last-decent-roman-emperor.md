Constantine XI, the Last Emperor, was dealt a pretty lousy hand by history, but he played it well.

He inherited a tiny, shrunken Byzantine state, with Asia Minor already lost and much of Greece and the southern Balkans nibbled away by various Italian outposts. He was originally the Despot ("Captain") of Morea, the late Byzantine province where Sparta had once stood. He fought against both the Italians and the Turks, restoring most of Greece proper to Byzantine control - but his ambitious statelet could not stand against the Turkish juggernaught: although Constantine was "the last emperor" he actually received his diadem from the Sultan of Turkey. 

 Nonetheless, when a new Sultan decided to stamp out the last vestiges of Byzantium, Constantine threw himself wholeheartedly into the defense, trying desperately to unite both the politically fractured Byzantines and various westerners resident in Constantinople to stem the tide. 

The Turks offered him a comfortable retirement in his old kingdom of Morea, but he refused it. For five months, Constantine led 7,000 defenders against a Turkish force of 60,000, equipped with "state of the art" gunpowder weapons. He died in the front ranks of his troops on the day the city fell. 

 In Greek folklore, Constantine is a King Arthur figure, the "[The Marble Emperor](https://books.google.com/books?id=lnSmnmL984YC&pg=PA102&lpg=PA102&dq=marble+emperor&source=bl&ots=WWLaruRUBs&sig=Y_SLq3O-_b1r8wTaoK7nQPrfCW0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1ZlkVfOGIJHVoATTnYGgBw&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=marble%20emperor&f=false)", who will return from the grave to save Constantinople from future perils.
