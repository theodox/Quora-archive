No. It’s a writing method but it’s not alphabetic. Cuneiform is a hellaciously complicated way to write things; it makes traditional Chinese look very straightforward.

There are around a thousand symbols — the vagueness comes from the fact that cuneiform was adapted to write many different languages over the span of nearly 3,000 years and so it’s difficult to decide on what’s really part of the core character set.* Frequently there are multiple ways to write the same thing, and it’s not always obvious to us, millennia later, if the choice is some kind of subtle style thing, a regional variation, or just the ancient equivalent of “aluminum” vs “aluminium.”



To give a good idea of how wacky the system is, consider the checkered career of one of the most popular signs, 𒀭.

𒀭 can mean the word “sky” — sometimes it’s just a pictographic symbol for that idea, so a scribe who spoke Hurrian could read that symbol and think “sky” even if the writer spoke Urartian. 𒀭 can also be spoken aloud (if you’re Sumerian) as _diĝir_ or as _an —_ because the symbol for sky became closely associated with [Anu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu), the Sumerian sky-god, and so writing 𒀭 is a quick way of referring to him. From there, it became shorthand for gods in general; so often 𒀭 before a name is a way of indicating that the name is the name of a god, not necessarily Anu. So you’d write the name of the goddes [Ningal ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningal)as 𒀭𒊩𒌆𒃲 with the symbol unspoken but just reminding the reader that this is a divine name.**

Remember how 𒀭 can be spoken as _diĝir?_ Well, if you’re a woman (at least, if the writing represents the speech of a woman) it could be _dimer_ instead.

If you want to indicate multiple gods, you would write 𒀭𒀭. But if you write 𒀯, it means “stars” or “constellations”

And, if you’re an Akkadian (rather than a Sumerian) speaker your word for sky is _šamû_  and the word for god is _ilum._ So the symbol might be used to sound _šamû_  or the syllable _il._ But, Akkadian scribes tended to simplify 𒀭 to a symbol that looked like this:

_(the standard web font for cuneiform only supports the Sumerian version — even computers can’t keep up with this stuff)._ 

And in Akkadian you also used the _diĝir / ilum / an / šamû / god_ symbol to indicate a priest or priestess, so it can also be “reverend” as a title.



That’s __one__ “letter,” cuneiform style. Suddenly “gh” = “f” in English doesn’t feel too bad, does it?

Even Mesopotamian scribes got kind of tired of it, and later cuneiform became [increasingly syllabic](http://www.ancientscripts.com/akkadian.html). Around 3400 years ago [Ugaritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugaritic) scribes invented a subset of cuneiform which basically functioned as an alphabet, and we actually inherit our “ABC” order from Ugarit’s _“ABG”_ by way of Phoenician. Unfortunately, Ugarit was wiped off the map during the [Bronze Age Collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse) and rest of the cuneiform world did not pick up the technique. It would take the better part of a millennium before the experiment was repeated: the Persians invented an artificial form of cuneiform to write their own language which was pretty rational, with only around 50 characters and a quasi-alphabetic ability to separate vowels and consonants. Unfortunately for the clay tablet industry, this cuneiform “alphabet” came too late — [Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic), which is alphabetic, was becoming the writing system of choice across the Near East and Persian cuneiform never took root outside of a handful of official inscriptions.

Here is a good non-technical overview of the weirdness that is cuneiform, by the great Irving Finkel of the British Museum.





* In this connection we should note that the Latin alphabet has evolved quite a few in its shorter lifespan — things like Ø, ç, ß, ë, Š, or ů which help capture sounds that the Romans never worried about.
** In case you’re wondering why ‘Ningal” has 3 characters after the digir, its 𒊩 (silent female determinative) 𒌆 nin 𒃲 gal.
