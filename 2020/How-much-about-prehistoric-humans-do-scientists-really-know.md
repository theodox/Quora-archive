There are some things we know with remarkable precision.

This video, for example, is a really compelling introduction to what we’ve been able to figure out about the life and death of “Ötzi the Iceman” — the Neolithic man whose frozen body was uncovered in an Alpine glacier field in 1991



On the other thing there are a vast number of things we’ll probably never know with much certainty. We can’t really recover the thinking behind something like this cave painting (from the [Magura caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magura_Cave) in Bulgaria)

We can make guesses, of course, but most archaeological artifacts don’t have any written context to preserve their original intentions, and so we’re forced to admire and speculate but can’t claim to really know. Archaeology and modern forensics are powerful tools for reconstructing the physical embodiments of life long ago, but they only goes so far in the absence of a written or oral cultural connection to the things we’re seeing.
