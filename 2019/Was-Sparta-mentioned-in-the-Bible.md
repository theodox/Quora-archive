Yes, at least in Catholic and Orthodox bibles — the relevant book, I Maccabees is considered “apocrypha” by Protestant versions and is not included in the Jewish Tanakh.

In [1 Maccabees 12,](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Maccabees+12&version=GNT) the text recounts some of the diplomatic efforts of [High Priest Jonathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Apphus), who sought an alliance with the several foreign powers, including both Rome and Sparta, against the Seleucid Empire. In the letters quoted, Jonathan claims to have records of previous correspondence with Sparta in which both Jews and Spartans claimed some kind of ancestral kinship — not exactly what one would have guessed about this particular pairing.
