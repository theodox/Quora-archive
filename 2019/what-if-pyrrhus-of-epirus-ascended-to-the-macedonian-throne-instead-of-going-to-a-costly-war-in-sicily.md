He did. Twice - once before and once after his adventures in Italy and Sicily.

However, like most of Pyrrhus’s schemes, the conquest of Macedonia was ephemeral. Pyrrus is [notorious for quixotic adventures. ](https://www.quora.com/What-if-Pyrrhus-had-successfully-kicked-Carthage-out-of-Sicily/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=cf35383d&srid=zLvM)But even a more sober, slow-paced conqueror would have had a hard time leaving a mark in third-century Macedonia. The place was a madhouse.

Consider this timeline:

__310 BC__ : [Cassander ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassander)murders Alexander the Great’s son, Alexander IV

__309__ : Cassander murders Alexander’s illegitimate son Heracles

__297__ : Cassander dies; leaving his sons [Alexander V ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_V_of_Macedon)and [Antipater II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipater_II_of_Macedon) as joint kings

__294__ : Antipater II murders his own mother and tries to murder Alexander, who escapes. Alexander calls in Pyrrhus and [Demetrius Poliorcetes ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_I_of_Macedon)(who is also married to Pyrrhus’ sister) to aid against his brother. Antipater is driven out by the allies— and then Demetrius murders Alexander and takes the throne for himself.

Pyrrhus and Demetrius turn on each other. Pyrrhus defeats Demetrius’ best general hand-to-hand in front of both armies, creating a glamorous reputation for himself as a Homeric hero. War ends in a truce.

__292__ : Pyrrhus raids Macedonia, and momentarily overruns the kingdom as many Macedonians (remembering his battlefield charisma) defect to him. However Demetrius is preparing for a wider war in the eastern Mediterranean and has vast resources; Pyrrhus is driven off handily. Since Demetrius is obsessed with reassembling Alexander’s empire, he doesn’t want to waste time with Epirus and lets Pyrrhus off unpunished.

__291__ : Demetrius marries Pyrrus’ estranged ex-wife Lanassa, handing over the island of Corcyra as her dowry. So he’s now married to both Pyrrhus sister and his ex-wife.

__287__ : All of the major successors (Lysimachus, Seleucus and Ptolemy) ally against Demetrius. Pyrrhus joins the alliance as a junior partner, hoping to pick up some spoils.

Once the fighting starts a sizable fraction of Demetrius’ army deserts to Pyrrhus after one battle. Demetrius remains on the loose, but Pyrrhus and Lysimachus partition Macedonia between themselves.

__285__ : Demetrius is defeated and captured; almost immediately Lysimachus turns on Pyrrhus and drives him out of Macedonia.

So, that’s five rulers in less than a decade, along with several unprovoked wars, a bunch of assassinations, matricide, and some creepy brother-in-law/ex-wife action.

And that’s _just Act I._ 

While Pyrrhus was off adventuring in the west things in Macedon continued to be crazy. in 282, Seleucus defeated and killed Lysimachus. However he didn’t live long enough to seize Macedonia for himself: the next year Seleucus was betrayed and murdered by [Ptolemy Keraunos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_Keraunos). who took Macedonia for himself (briefly uniting it with Egypt). Demetrius’s son [Antigonus Gonatas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigonus_II_Gonatas) was hoping to reclaim the throne for his family. but Ptolemy drove him off. However Ptolemy was then [defeated and killed by a invading Gaulish tribes](http://oloohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brennus_(3rd_century_BC)), who overran Macedon in 279. Antigonus, who was still waiting for his opportunity, landed in 277 and helped to drive out the Gauls, reclaiming the Macedonian throne for himself in the process.

In case you’re counting, we’re now up to seven kings (plus two interregna and a barbarian invasion) in 20 years.

Pyrrhus returned from the west in __275__ . He had tried to get Antigonus to loan him money for his western campaigns, but had been politely refused. So now that he was back in Greece — and broke — decided to get money in the time-tested Macedonian way: by stealing it. He hired many of the Gauls who were still floating around northern Greece as mercenaries, and then invaded Macedon for the fourth time.

In classic Pyrrhic fashion, the affair began splendidly: a few lucky wins on the battlefield and Pyrrhus’ charisma turned the raid into a rout. Much of Antigonus’ army defected and soon the get-rich-quick scheme had Pyrrhus in control of most of Macedonia.

In classic Pyrrhic fashion, things quickly slide downhill. He offended his new subjects by garrisoning the hated Gauls in Macedonian towns. He couldn’t hide his disdain for the ordinary business of governing. And above all Pyrrhus did what he always did: left the job half done: in __272__ he took his army off to invade Sparta while Antigonus was still holed up — weakened but far from toothless — Macedonian Thrace. The invasion was botched. Although technically Pyrrhus was the first foreigner ever to enter Sparta by force his glory was short lived: he was driven out again by the resistance of Spartan reservists, women, and children. On his retreat he launched an opportunistic and underhanded attack on neutral Argos — but the Argives brought in the army of Antigonus, who was more than happy to capitalize on Pyrrhus’ shortsightedness. Pyrrhus lost his life to a roof-tile thrown by an angry mother in the streets of Argos.

Antigonus dismantled Pyrrhus’ army and claimed the Macedonian throne, drawing a line under two decades of chaos in the kingdom. His family would still be on the throne when the Romans finally dissolved Macedonia in 168.
