# What motivates technical writers? Is it the opportunity to write about cool technology, the money, helping users, or something else completely?

I've met two kinds:

One set of people enjoyed immersing themselves in difficult subjects, distilling them down into clear, understandable prose, and then moving on. They seem to get the same kind of pleasure that many Quorans do (as another answer mentions) from clarifying things.

The other set -- alas -- seemed primarily interested in demoing their mastery of Microsoft Word templates. I was amazed at how many of the tech writers I interviewed were completely uninterested in different ways to reach audiences, and really seemed to feel that mastery of Word's innermost features was the key of their professional success and worth to others. Subject matter, prose, desire to help people understand things better -- none of this seemed to matter to this group.
