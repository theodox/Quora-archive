There were several groups of antagonists who faced the Romans on a fairly equal footing, although only one of them ever posed anything like an existential threat to Rome.

The most famous antagonist is __[Carthage](https://www.ancient.eu/carthage/)__ , the city-state in modern Tunisia which created an empire in North Africa, Sicily, Sardinia and Spain and fought [three long, bitter wars with Rome between 264 and 146 BC.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punic_Wars) The famous Hannibal, who fought the Romans to a standstill for nearly two decades, was a Carthaginian. In addition to military brilliance he succeeded in detaching many of Rome’s Italian subjects and turning them against their one-time masters; it would not have take much luck for Hannibal to break Roman hegemony in Italy and reduce it to one of many regional powers. Only the combination of Rome’s tremendous political will and deep reserves of manpower — plus the politico-military skills of Scipio Africanus — enabled Rome to win out in the end.

In terms of cultural and economic rivalry, it was the [Hellenistic empires](http://www.greek-thesaurus.gr/hellenistic-kingdoms.html) — the warring fragments of Alexander the Great’s empire —- which provided Rome’s biggest challenges, but also it’s biggest opportunities. The wars with the __[Kingdom of Macedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_Wars)__  (214 to 148 BC) marked Rome’s definitive rise to Great Power status in the Mediterranean; the Macedonians fielded the most vaunted land forces in the Greek world. The __[Seleucid Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman%E2%80%93Seleucid_War)__  was a less formidable antagonist, because it was on the verge of a rapid decline when the Romans finally confronted it; however it was still a formidable power. By the time the Romans entered into direct conflicts with __Ptolemaic Egypt__ , that kingdom was in serious decline due to internal dissension and mismanagement; it was, however, still the wealthiest part of the Greek world and would remain the crown jewel of the Roman empire for centuries to come. Egypt’s biggest “challenge” to Rome came [when Cleopatra and her lover Marc Antony confronted the future emperor Augustus from 32 to 30 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_War_of_the_Roman_Republic). The piecemeal absorption of the Hellenistic kingdoms between 214 and 30 BC provided a tremendous boost to Rome’s economy, and permanently welded Roman political and military power to Greek culture and economic prowess, creating the hybrid culture that would dominate the Mediterranean until the rise of Islam.

The most dangerous of Rome’s Hellenistic opponents, however was not actually a Greek kingdom at all: the __[Kingdom of Pontus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Pontus)__ , along the eastern shores of the Black Sea was a wealthy and sophisticated kingdom with strong ties to the Greek world. From [88 to 63 BC the Pontic empire was a serious threat to the Roman position in the east](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridatic_Wars), King [Mithridates VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus) rallied a number of different disaffected groups against the Romans and battled some of Rome’s greatest generals including Sulla, Lucullus, and Pompey the Great.

In the end, though, the true Great Power enemies of the Romans were two Persian empires, first the __[Parthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman%E2%80%93Parthian_Wars)__ (66 BC to 127 AD) and then the __[Sassanids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire)__ (337 to 628) — a rivalry which lasted, with many reverses of fortune, for more than six hundred years. On the whole the Romans were more dangerous to their Persian enemies than vice-versa but the relationship was never lopsided; some scholars think it was the costs of confronting the Persians first in the fourth and then again in the sixth century which made it impossible for Rome to save the western half of the empire. Beyond a doubt, the [climax of the long Roman-Persian rivalry fatally weakened both sides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_War_of_602%E2%80%93628), paving the way for the Arab conquests of the seventh century and the permanent disunion of the Mediterranean world.

A possible add-on to the list would be the short-lived __[Palmyrene Empire,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyrene_Empire)__  based in the Syrian city of the same name. During a period of turmoil in the Roman world, when the Romans were fighting an interminable civil war in the mid 3rd century, Rome’s client state in Palmyra took advantage of the chaos to briefly dominate the Middle East (including a short occupation of Egypt, from 270 to 272). However the Palmyrene challenge was more political than military — a slightly different outcome on the battlefield might have meant this “foreign” enemy was just another frontier province providing a new emperor (or more precisely, [empress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenobia)) for the turbulent empire.
