# Why don't academia teach us more about Sumerian culture, or are they afraid that people will learn that the Bible is a copy of the Enumah Elish?

It’s a lonely feeling to be passionate about a fascinating subject while the world spends infinitely more attention on Kim Kardashian’s wardrobe or the canonicity of the Snyder Cut. _Anything_  that gets people talking about Sumer is good news to the few thousand people who actually focus on the subject professionally — your average Sumerologist would gleefully slip a Russian troll-farm money to flood the internet with this theory. In then end it’s _all about this google hits_ . As a matter of fact I’ve long suspected that [Zecharaiah Sitchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zecharia_Sitchin) is nothing but a brilliant long-running guerilla marketing ploy by the [Oriental Institute](https://oi.uchicago.edu/). When you are in the cuneiform tablet trade, there is no such thing as bad publicity.

_Unfortunately, I can tell you from experience these tend to shrink vertically. Order one size up._ 

Unfortunately, when the unwashed masses finally arrive in the Cuneiform section of your local library, they will be a bit disappointed to find that the Bible is _not_  a copy of the _Enūma Eliš_ (we’re trying to rock people’s world, here, so let’s use the properly impressive diacritical marks).

My memory may be a bit faulty here but this feels a bit more…. action packed?… than Genesis to me:

> They banded themselves together and at the side of Tiamat they advanced;
They were furious; they devised mischief without resting night and day.
They prepared for battle, fuming and raging;
They joined their forces and made war,
Ummu-Hubur [Tiamat] who formed all things,
Made in addition weapons invincible; she spawned monster-serpents,
Sharp of tooth, and merciless of fang;
With poison, instead of blood, she filled their bodies.
Fierce monster-vipers she clothed with terror,
With splendor she decked them, she made them of lofty stature.
Whoever beheld them, terror overcame him,
Their bodies reared up and none could withstand their attack.
She set up vipers and dragons, and the monster Lahamu,
And hurricanes, and raging hounds, and scorpion-men,
And mighty tempests, and fish-men, and rams;
They bore cruel weapons, without fear of the fight.
Her commands were mighty, none could resist them;
After this fashion, huge of stature, she made eleven [kinds of] monsters.
Among the gods who were her sons, inasmuch as he had given her support,
She exalted Kingu; in their midst she raised him to power.
To march before the forces, to lead the host,
To give the battle-signal, to advance to the attack,
To direct the battle, to control the fight,
Unto him she entrusted; in costly raiment she made him sit, saying:
I have uttered thy spell, in the assembly of the gods I have raised thee to power.
The dominion over all the gods have I entrusted unto him.
Be thou exalted, thou my chosen spouse,
May they magnify thy name over all of them the Anunnaki."

(from the first tablet; full text [here](http://Enūma Eliš https://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/enuma.htm))

For record, the _Enūma Eliš_ is not Sumerian, at least not wholly: it’s written in Akkadian, not Sumerian, although there is a Sumerian substrate. [Marduk](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/marduk/), the great warrior who defeats Tiamat, is most famously the city god of Babylon. He gradually absorbed a lot of the traits of [Enlil](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/enlil/index.html), [Anu](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/an/index.html), and [Enki](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/enki/index.html) over the course Babylon’s rise to regional power in southern Mesoptamia. The _Enūma Eliš_ is often summarized as the “Babylonian creation myth” but that’s not very accurate; the core of the story is how Marduk succeeded where the other gods (notably, and not coincidentally, including Anu) failed against Tiamat. This justifies his position as the foremost god in the pantheon:

> I sent Anu, but he could not withstand her;
Nudimmud was afraid and turned back.
But Marduk hath set out, the director of the gods, your son;
To set out against Tiamat his heart hath prompted him.
He opened his mouth and spake unto me, saying: "If I, your avenger,
Conquer Tiamat and give you life,
Appoint an assembly, make my fate preeminent and proclaim it.
In Upsukkinaku seat yourself joyfully together;
With my word in place of you will I decree fate.
May whatsoever I do remain unaltered,
May the word of my lips never be changed nor made of no avail."'

(tablet 2 from the same text)

Again, I don’t remember this bit from Sunday School.

It’s likely that the question is really thinking about the flood story from the Sumerian _Epic of Bilgameš_ (for open-your-eyes-sheeple cred, we use [the fancy spelling ](https://www.quora.com/Is-Gilgamesh-real-name-Bilgames/answer/Steve-Theodore)in preference to the familiar _Gilgamesh_ ).

That really does have a strong biblical parallel, although it’s hardly a 1:1 match. There are a number of references to a universal flood in both Sumerian and Akkadian sources. There are also quite a few proverbial expressions that show up in other books of the Bible — generalities along the lines of “Mankind can number his days. Whatever he may achieve, it is only wind” (Babylonian) becoming “I saw all the deeds that are done under the sun; and see, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.” (Ecclesiastes, 1:14). This sentiment also colors [many 1970’s pop songs](https://youtu.be/tH2w6Oxx0kQ).

Whatever conspiracy has been suppressing that one is remarkably inept:

_The New York Times, circa 1915_ 

But of course it’s hard to keep a secret that’s been out for about 1600 years. The existence of a Mesopotamian flood narrative was regarded by early Christian writers as proof of their own position: A Mesopotamian version of the flood story is cited in Eusebius of Caesarea’s [Chronicon ](http://www.attalus.org/translate/eusebius.html)— his effort at creating a complete harmonization of all the known chronologies in the early fourth century AD:

> After him, there were other kings, including Sisuthrus, to whom Cronus foretold that there would be a great torrent of rain on the fifteenth day of the month of Daesius. Cronus ordered him to conceal all the books which were kept in Heliopolis, the city of the Sippareni. Sisuthrus did as instructed, and then he sailed away to Armenia. Immediately it began to happen as the god had foretold. On the third day, when the rain eased, Sisuthrus sent out some birds, to test if they could see any land rising up out of the sea. But they found nothing except a gaping wide sea, and, having nowhere to rest, they flew back to Sisuthrus. The same thing happened when [he sent] some other birds. But he achieved success with the third set of birds, who came back with mud splattered on the bottom of their feet, and then the gods removed him from the sight of men. The inhabitants of Armenia made wooden amulets out of his ship, as a protection against poisons.

> I think that it will be obvious to everyone that what Abydenus says about the flood is similar to the story of the Hebrews, and uses the same form of words. That these historians, whether they are Greeks or Chaldaeans, give Noah a different name, and call him Sisuthrus, is hardly surprising. Nor is it surprising that, as is their custom, they refer to gods rather than God, and talk about birds in general without mentioning a dove.

Interestingly _Sisuthrus_  here is clearly a translation of the Sumerian “Noah” [Ziususudra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziusudra) — a really remarkable example of legitimate Sumerian factoid still circulating in the fourth century of our era. You’d have expected the much later Akkadian name [Atra-Hasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atra-Hasis).



If you’d like to learn more about Sumerian culture, you could do a lot worse than the works of Samuel Noah Kramer, the dean of American Sumerologists. Although some of his work is a little dated he was a gifted interpreter of the language with a talent for bringing the day-to-day feel of Sumerian civilization to life.



For a very contrasting view of the same Mesopotamia — particularly from a somewhat abstract theological point of view, there’s also Thorkild Jacobsen:



If you want to bring Sumeria to the masses, you might want to visit or make a donation to the Oriental Insitute:



or the Penn Museum:



You should also get acquainted with the British Museum’s Irving Finkel, who covers the Noah-Atrahasis connection very entertainingly.
