The Hapsburg family — who ruled Spain from 1504 to 1700 — were the worlds greatest practitioners of [marital diplomacy](http://globalconnections.champlain.edu/2015/12/07/4420/). They managed to marry their way into the world’s largest empire with remarkably more love than war.

In the particular case of the Netherlands, it was actually Spain that got added to the Hapsburg family possessions rather than the other way round. Philip Hapsburg “the Handsome” — who was, by the way, born in Belgium — inherited a portion of the Netherlands from his mother, the last member of the ducal family of Burgundy.

Philip was married to a junior Spanish princess, [Juana “the mad”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_of_Castile), the second daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella . This was primarily a way of cementing an alliance between Spain and the Holy Roman Empire against France. However Juana’s brother and sister both died without heirs, leaving Juana the queen and Philip as [Philip the first of Castile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_I_of_Castile) by virtue of his marriage to her.

_Philip the Handsome. I, frankly, don’t see it._ 

Philip didn’t live long as a Spanish king, but Philip and Juana’s son [Charles the first and fifth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) united Spain and the other Hapsburg territories — he was both king of Spain (as Carlos I) and Holy Roman Emperor (as Karl V ). Here’s his official title:

> Charles, by the grace of God, Holy Roman Emperor, forever August, King of Germany, King of Italy, King of all Spains, of Castile, Aragon, León, Navarra, Grenada, Toledo, Valencia, Galicia, Majorca, Sevilla, Cordova, Murcia, Jaén, Algarves, Algeciras, Gibraltar, the Canary Islands, King of Two Sicilies, of Sardinia, Corsica, King of Jerusalem, King of the Western and Eastern Indies, Lord of the Islands and Main Ocean Sea, Archduke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy, Brabant, Lorraine, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, Limburg, Luxembourg, Gelderland, Neopatria, Württemberg, Landgrave of Alsace, Prince of Swabia, Asturia and Catalonia, Count of Flanders, Habsburg, Tyrol, Gorizia, Barcelona, Artois, Burgundy Palatine, Hainaut, Holland, Seeland, Ferrette, Kyburg, Namur, Roussillon, Cerdagne, Zutphen, Margrave of the Holy Roman Empire, Burgau, Oristano and Gociano, Lord of Frisia, the Wendish March, Pordenone, Biscay, Molin, Salins, Tripoli and Mechelen.

Where every one of those names is a once-independent territory which was added to the Hapsburg patrimony by one or another dynastic marriage and the fates of inheritance.

This map shows the incredible patchwork of territories which Charles inherited through his Spanish, Burgundian, Austrian and Italian ancestors.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the enormous power which Charles inherited made the Hapsburg empire the focus of powerful enemies. Charles ruled for 40 year as the most powerful man in Europe. When he abdicated in 1556, he gave the title of Emperor and the lands in the east to his younger brother [Ferdinand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), while passing Spain, the Netherlands, and Spain’s enormous empire in the new world to his son [Philip II.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain)

The current Spanish royal family is still descended from the marriage of Philip and Juana, although the male line died out in 1700. Instead the Bourbons ended up on throne of Spain because of yet another Hapsburg marriage. In fact the biggest war of the early 18th century — the [War of the Spanish Succession ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession)— was fought between a Hapsburg emperor (in Austria) and a half-Hapsburg claimaint to the Spanish throne ([Philip V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_V_of_Spain#Early_years)) over the will of the last Hapsburg king of Spain ([Charles II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Spain)).
