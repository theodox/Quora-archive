Our biographical information on Pythagoras is, unfortunately, not very reliable — anything we say about him comes with some serious reservations.

Pythagoras lived in the sixth century BCE. His name-checked mentioned in a number of near-contemporary texts, so he’s almost certainly a historical person. Unfortunately for us the very detailed biographies we have for him are of much later date. There was big revival of interest in Pythagoras in Roman times; most of the stories we have about Pythagoras come from between about 250 and 300 CE and are thus almost a thousand years after his own era.

If you’re trying to figure out if Pythagoras was connected to a Phoenician tradition, it’s worth noting that two of his most famous biographies do come from the Levant. The Phoenician philosopher [Porphyry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyry_(philosopher)) wrote a biography of Pythagoras which was then expanded upon by his student [Iamblichus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iamblichus), a Syrian. Porphyry wrote this of Pythagoras parentage:

> Many think that Pythagoras was the son of Mnesarchus, but they differ as to the latter's race; some thinking him a Samian, while Neanthes, in the fifth book of his Fables states he was a Syrian, from the city of Tyre. As a famine had arisen in Samos, Mnesarchus went thither to trade, and was naturalized there. There also was born his son Pythagoras, who early manifested studiousness, but was later taken to Tyre, and there entrusted to the Chaldeans, whose doctrines he imbibed. Thence he returned to Ionia, where he first studied under the Syrian Pherecydes, then also under Hermodamas the Creophylian who at that time was an old man residing in Samos.

> Neanthes says that others hold that his father was a Tyrrhenian, of those who inhabit Lemnos, and that while on a trading trip to Samos was there naturalized. On sailing to Italy, Mnesarchus took the youth Pythagoras with him. Just at this time this country was greatly flourishing. Neanthes adds that Pythagoras had two older brothers, Eunostus and Tyrrhenus. But Apollonius, in his book about Pythagoras, affirms that his mother was Pythais, a descendant, of Ancaeus, the founder of Samos.

Porphyry, [Life of Pythagoras, 1.1](https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_life_of_pythagoras_02_text.htm)

Iamblichus wrote a slightly different version, in which Pythagoras is born in Sidon but his parents are clearly Greek:

> It is reported that Ancaeus, who dwelt in Cephallenian Same, was descended from Zeus, the fame of which honorable descent might have been derived from his virtue, or from a certain magnanimity; in any case, he surpassed the remainder of the Cephallenians in wisdom and renown. This Ancaeus was, by the Pythian oracle, bidden form a colony from Arcadia and Thessaly; and besides leading some inhabitants of Athens, Epidaurus, and Chalcis, he was to render habitable an island, which, from the virtue of the soil and vegetation was to be called Blackleaved, while the city was to be called Samos, after Same, in Cephallenia…. From the family and alliance of this Ancaeus, founder of the colony, were therefore descended Pythagoras's parents Mnesarchus and Pythais.

> That Pythagoras was the son of Apollo is a legend due to a certain Samian poet, who thus described the popular recognition of the nobility of his birth. Sang he,

> _Pythais, the fairest of the Samian race
To Apollo bore Pythagoras, dear to Zeus._ 

> It might be worth while to relate the circumstances of the prevalence of this report. Mnesarchus had gone to Delphi on a business trip, leaving his wife without any signs of pregnancy. He enquired of the oracle about the event of his return voyage to Syria, and he was informed that his trip would be lucrative, and most conformable to his wishes; but that his wife was now with child, and would present him with a son who would surpass all who had ever lived in beauty and wisdom, and that he would be of the greatest benefit to the human race in everything pertaining to human achievements.

> But when Mnesarchus realized that the God, without waiting for any question about a son, had by an oracle informed him that he would possess an illustrious prerogative, and a truly divine gift, he immediately changed his wife's former name Parthenis to one reminiscent of the Delphic prophet and her son, naming her Pythais.

> He called the son, who was born to her at Sidon in Phoenicia, Pythagoras, by this name commemorating that such an offspring had been promised him by the Pythian Apollo. The assertions of Epimenides, Eudoxus and Xenocrates, that Apollo having at that time already had actual connexion with Parthenis, causing her pregnancy, had regularized that fact by predicting the birth of Pythagoras, are by no means to be admitted.

_Iamblichus,_ _[Life of Pythagoras 2.3](https://topostext.org/work.php?work_id=487)_ 

Diogenes Laertius, who lived around the same time (but whose exact lifetime is not well known) called Pythagoras

> son of the gem-engraver Mnesarchus, and according to Hermippus, a Samian, or, according to Aristoxenus, a Tyrrhenian from one of those islands which the Athenians held after clearing them of their Tyrrhenian inhabitants. Some indeed say that he was descended through Euthyphro, Hippasus and Marmacus from Cleonymus, who was exiled from Phlius, and that, as Marmacus lived in Samos, so Pythagoras was called a Samian

Diogenes Laertius, _[Lives of Eminent Philosophers, 8.1](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D1)_ 

So — as you can see even among Pythagoras’ admirers there was not complete uniformity about his parentage. The most common version seems to have been the one reported by Iamblichus, that he was descended from a merchant named Mnesarchus and was a Samian citizen, but as you can see there were multiple accounts of his family’s ethnic origins and then as now there was no easy way to distinguish between them.

It was always very common to assume that Pythagoras had studied in Egypt and Phoenicia but none of the sources tries to connect that to his family background.

The choice of the Tyrrhenians as a possible ethnicity might be historic but it might also reflect the prevalence of Pythagorean communities in the Greek cities of southern Italy. Different Greek writers believed the either Etruscans, the Romans, or all the Italian tribes generally were descendants of [Tyrrhenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrhenians), a people who they saw as native to the northern Aegean or northwest Anatolia. For a southern Italian of the Roman era, from a mixed Greek-Italic background and growing up in an area where Pythagoreanism was a popular tradition, it would be appealing to see Pythagoras as a Tyrrhenian like some many of southern-Italian followers.
