It’s the Greek letter Lambda, which looks like this: __Λ__ 

The Spartan city-state went by the name of _Lacedaemon_ , __Λακεδαίμων__ in Greek. Most Greek warriors were much more individualistic; garish monsters or bold patterns were the norm for most hoplites. But, in classic jock-fashion, the Spartans were _lettermen_ .

This kind of variety is what most Greek warriors flaunted. The Spartans cultivated an air of uniformity to reinforce their reputation for discipline and unity.
