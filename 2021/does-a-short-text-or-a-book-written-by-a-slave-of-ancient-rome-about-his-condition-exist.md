No, not really in the sense you’d expect from the “slave narrative” genre.

The closest we come are the _[Discourses](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.1.one.html)_ of __[Epictetus](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epictetus/#LifWor)__ , a first century Stoic philosopher who was a slave for much of his life (as slave of a slave, in fact: his owner was [Epaphroditus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epaphroditus_(freedman_of_Nero)), a slave himself under Claudius, but a high-ranking bureaucrat under Nero). The preface to the Discourses attributes the written version to the historian [Arrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrian), who was one of his philosophical followers. The style, however, is very brusque and forceful, quite distinct from Arrian’s other works (such as his history of Alexander the Great). This leads us to believe that the Discourses strongly reflect the personal style of Epictetus himself.

It’s perhaps not an accident that a former slave was attracted to Stoicism: a philosophy which strongly emphasized the importance of inner freedom and disdain for the conditions of the outside world. [For example:](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.1.one.html)

> I must die. Must I then die lamenting?

> I must be put in chains. Must I then also lament?

> I must go into exile. Does any man then hinder me from going with smiles and cheerfulness and contentment?

> "Tell me the secret which you possess." I will not, for this is in my power. "But I will put you in chains." Man, what are you talking about? Me in chains? You may fetter my leg, but my will not even Zeus himself can overpower.

> "I will throw you into prison." My poor body, you mean. "I will cut your head off." When, then, have I told you that my head alone cannot be cut off? These are the things which philosophers should meditate on, which they should write daily, in which they should exercise themselves.

Another former-slave-author was [Publius Terentius Afer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence), usually known in English as “Terence”. He was a slave, probably from North Africa, who was a popular playwright in the the middle of the 2d century BC. His plays were mostly riffs on conventional Greek comedy formulas. Interestingly he avoided the most pronounced trope of ancient comedy: the clever, but sly and scheming slave who in most Greek and Roman comedies is the main protagonist: the character of Pseudolus in _A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum_  is perfect example of this common ancient stereotype — one which Terence generally found ways to avoid.
