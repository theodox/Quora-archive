It’s probably not Latin — there are very few words in Latin that start with a K, and you can’t make the ‘ji’ sound in Latin very easily: the Romans used the same letter for _i_  and _j._ Same for _v:_ in Latin it’s written with a _u._ 

Either this is a bad close-captioning or a made-up language. The only Latin bits are:

_septem_  with an e is ‘seven’ _septum_  is the boundary of a compartment, a wall, or a ‘surrounding’.

_nostrum_  is “ours”.

Maybe _kangi-gar_  is what the close-captioning bot made of _conjugārer,_ which would be ‘may I be joined’ but I can’t think of what to do with ‘von’ as writtem.If ‘septum von’ is misheard for _septorum_  you’d have _conjugārer septorum nostrum,_  “may I be joined with our surroundings”… which doesn’t sound right but might make some grammatical of sense.
