Generally, unless the app in question is OSX-native it’ll be a port of the Windows versions . Unfortunately it’s pretty rare for the ported versions to be as ergonomic on OSX as they are on windows. Apple’s dislike of multi-button mice is a common issue, and driver support for extra devices like pucks or tablets tends to lag a bit. Some of the nicer OSX touches — like multi-touch on trackpads — don’t help much with CAD style applications. And of course you’ll need to find a mac-friendly keyboard with function keys for most CAD apps.

I use Maya on Windows and OSX and while it’s totally workable, I generally find it easier to do my Maya work on Windows — even though I prefer OSX for most other tasks.
