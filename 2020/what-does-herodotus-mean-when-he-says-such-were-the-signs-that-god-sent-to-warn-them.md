Here’s a different translation of the same passage (Herodotus 6.27)

> Ever is some warning given by heaven, when great ills threaten cities or nations; for before all this plain signs had been sent to the Chians. Of a band of a hundred youths whom they had sent to Delphi two only returned, ninety-eight being caught and carried off by pestilence; moreover, at about this same time, a little before the sea‑fight, the roof fell in on boys at school, insomuch that of a hundred and twenty of them one alone escaped. These signs had been shown to them by heaven; thereafter the sea‑fight brake upon them and beat the city to its knees, and with that came Histiaeus and the Lesbians to end what the sea‑fight began; and the Chians being in so evil a case, he easily subdued them.

He’s merely repeating a commonplace idea (one that shows up in many other places in the _Histories_ , and in almost all ancient historical writing) — the idea that great changes of historical state don’t happen out of thin air but are instead foreshadowed by various kinds of omens and portents. Herodotus is full of this sort of thing — here’s how he describes the omens surrounding Xerxes march to Europe in 7.57:

> When the whole army had crossed, and the troops were now upon their march, a strange prodigy appeared to them, whereof the king made no account, though its meaning was not difficult to conjecture. Now the prodigy was this: a mare brought forth a hare. Hereby it was shown plainly enough, that Xerxes would lead forth his host against Greece with mighty pomp and splendor, but, in order to reach again the spot from which he set out, would have to run for his life. There had also been another portent, while Xerxes was still at Sardis, a mule dropped a foal, neither male nor female; but this likewise was disregarded. So Xerxes, despising the omens, marched forwards; and his land army accompanied him.

The general idea — quite uncontroversial in his day — was that the warning signs are there for those who choose to see them (contrariwise, the Spartans at Plataea for example do some things on the field which are militarily stupid because their diviners can’t come up with good omens for any the logical things to do — but, being Spartans and stubborn, they just keep trying until the omens turn favorable, and then go on to victory).

Modern readers are surprised by the singular “signs which God sent to warn them” — which the version I used above translates as “heaven” instead of capital-G god. Not unlike a lot of modern usage in, say, Hinduism, [Greeks could shift between ways of speech which seems monotheistic and those which seemed polytheistic quite fluidly without seeing a contradiction.](https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-ancient-Greek-word-Theos-mean-in-all-its-usages-and-connotations-How-can-it-be-explained-without-using-the-word-God/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=24a81984&srid=zLvM)
