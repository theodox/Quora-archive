Mycenaean Greek was close enough to familiar forms that we have been able to decipher Linear B tablets with fair — though far from complete! — certainty despite the clunky writing system.

That said, we don’t have the kind of sources that would give us a really deep insight into all of the linguistic changes between the end of the Mycenaean era and the rebirth of Greek literacy in the 9th c. BC. Most of what we have in Linear B is, honestly, pretty dull stuff: lists and accounting records. There may have been aspects of the Mycenaean version of the language which we just miss because we don’t see every aspect of the language in action.

There’s a lot of continuity in __vocabulary__ , though it takes a bit of imagination to see it thanks to the clumsiness of the Linear B syllabary. A good example example is _pa-ra-jo_ , which is the Linear B version of παλαιός, _palaios_  or “old” — this was a highly debated word early in the decipherment process until it was found opposed to _ne-wo,_  which corresponds to νέος, _neos,_ “young” and clinched the identification; Linear B can't distinguish between L and R. Likewise it took some imagination to realize that _a-to-ro-qo_  was ἄνθρωπος, _anthropos,_ “man”: Linear B doesn’t have a way to capture consonants at the end of a syllable, and the transliterated Q reflects the kind of [sound change which gives us cognate pairs like the Greek pente and Latin quinque.](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2016/01/22/jeffrey-aronson-when-i-use-a-word-fifty-up/) Sound changes are visible but particularly difficult to quantify: the lapse between the last Linear B evidence and the earliest alphabetic Greek is quite wide, about the same as that between us and Shakespeare — with the added variable of two incompatible writing systems.

However once orthography is put aside, most of the Linear B vocabulary can be matched up to familiar Greek words: _ma-te-re_ is μήτηρ, _mḗtēr_ , “mother”; _pa-te_ is πατήρ, _patḗr_ , “father”; te-o is θεός, theós, “god” and so on. Even personal and place names are recognizable _ai-ku-pi-ti-jo_ for _Aegyptos, “Egypt”_ and _pu-ro_ for Pylos, _po-se-da-o_ for Poseidon or _a-ki-re-u_ for Achilles.

A few words show up in Linear B as what seem to be everyday nouns survived into Classical times only as obscure technical terms — for example _ko-to-na,_ meaning “estate”, survived only as κτοίνα, “ktoina”, a township or jurisdiction in Rhodes. Often we have to guess at unfamiliar terms: Greek has no words corresponding exactly to _sa-pa-ke-te-ri-ja_ but context and the classical verb σφάζω, spházō, “to cut the throat” let us guess that it’s “animals to be sacrificed”. Most famously the title _qa-si-re-u_ , a low ranking office, survived as βασιλεύς, basileus or “king” — an eloquent testimony to the chaos that followed the end of the Bronze Age in Greece.

Cases like _qa-si-re-u_  and _a-to-ro-qo_  highlight the ultimate paradox of our understanding of Mycenaean Greek — It’s hard for use to really gauge the auditory difference between the Mycenaean version and their classical heirs because it’s hard to tease out how much of the difference was spoken and how much is due to the limitations of the writing system. Lacking more texts which really show the language going through all its paces — for example, poems or first-hand speech — it’s very tough to know how much of what we’re seeing is an archaic sounding language and how much is dubious Bronze Age orthography. Did Mycenaean Greek really not distinguish between what we’d later hear as L and R? Or is it just the writing system? It’s kind of significant the the [most detailed academic effort to assemble a Mycenaean grammar](http://sprawi.at/content/mykenisches_griechisch) has not actually gotten to grammar yet: the existing volumes are all about phonology and orthography.

Like classical Greek, Mycenaean __grammar__  depends on inflected endings to establish the grammar of a sentence. Here again we don’t have a lot of literary texts which would let us get a firm grasp of the nuances: laconic lists and diary entries are much more common. Thus, we don’t have as much evidence as we’d like for the flow of ordinary expressions.

We can however see that Mycenaean Greek has a few archaic features which dropped out of the later language. The familiar case structure of Greek nouns is present but Mycenaean retains* four additional noun cases besides the ones we know from the Classical language: an [ablative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablative_case#Greek) (“he came _from Crete”), an_ _[allative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allative_case)_ _(“to Thebes”),_  and _[instrumental](http://KKnohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_case#:~:text=In%20grammar%2C%20the%20instrumental%20case,object%20or%20an%20abstract%20concept.)_ __ (“he hit him _with a sword”)_ and__ a _[locative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locative_case)_ (“_in the palace_ ”). All of these folded into the surviving dative, genitive or accusative cases by Classical times, though the instrumental and locative leave traces in Homer.

One notable difference in usage is that classical Greek tends to use definite articles much more frequently than English does (“the Socrates goes to the agora”, as many students have been surprised to learn down the years). Mycenaean Greek — like Latin — does not seem to have a native definite article at all. In Homer, you can see the emergence of what will be the article from what are basically pronouns; [evidently a common example of the way articles emerge.](https://www.academia.edu/2177535/The_development_of_the_definite_article_in_Greek?auto=download)

We do see examples of past, present and future tenses, of infinitives and participles formed in much the same manner as later Greek. However here the limitations of the writing system remain a problem; the script doesn’t have an easy way to record vowel quantities or stresses so we’re sometimes unclear about how precisely a verb form is to be understood, and whether distinctions that would be visible in a classical text are obscured by the writing system.

In general, the __dialect__  of the Linear B texts is fairly homogeneous.[ It does not correspond in detail to any of the later dialectical groupings within the Greek world](https://www.jstor.org/stable/628239?seq=1)— his has sometimes been taken as evidence for the existence of a tightly-knit scribal class spread across the Mycenaean kingdoms. In a few areas we can see that Homer’s dialect preserves features or vocabulary visible in Mycenaean Greek — the [dual ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_(grammatical_number)#:~:text=There%20were%20only%20two%20distinct,author%20and%20certain%20stock%20expressions.)(a specialized plural for talking about exactly two subjects) and the instrumental we’ve already noted;

Conventional wisdom puts it closest to [Arcadocypriot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadocypriot_Greek), the notoriously conservative dialect which survived in Arcadia and the island of Cyprus. Traditionally this has been seen as evidence for the so-called [Dorian invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_invasion): the idea that the Dorian Greeks thrust down into central and southern Greece, displacing or subjugating earlier Greeks. In this view, Arcadocypriot is the most direct heir of the Mycenaean language with the other dialects reflecting the invasions and migrations of the years from around 1100 to 800 BC.

On the other hand John Chadwick, one of the key scholars behind the decipherment of Linear B, believed that there were perceptible traces of Doric dialect visible in Mycenaean Greek. [In the 1970’s he suggested that the delta between “Mycenaean” and “Doric” Greek was a class, rather than an ethnic difference](https://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/20-3/Thomas.pdf) — the language of the Linear B tablets was the language of the privileged classes who were overthrown by their local Greek subjects. This view has not found wide acceptance — but given the limitations of the evidence it’s worthy of consideration alongside the traditional view.

Overall, however, the most important thing to note about Mycenaean Greek is just that: it’s Greek. It clearly establishes the provenance of a recognizable Greek language community in the Mycenaean centers as far back as around 1450 BC — seven or eight centuries earlier than any written text in later forms of Greek. It shows that somebody was writing Greek when [Thuthmosis III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_III) was marching through the Levant, a century before King Tut was born.**



* “appears to retain” might be better — the nature of the evidence means we have to be a bit tentative.

**Incidentally Linear B confirms some level of contact as well: another Mycenaean word for “Egyptian” is _mi-sa-ra-jo,_ from “misr”, the Semitic word that today — via Arabic — is how Egyptians refer to their own country. This suggests that the Myceneans were in contact both with Egyptians (producing _ai-ku-pi-ti-jo)_ and Levantines (producing _mi-sa-ra-jo)._ On the other hand the decipherment of Linear B and its dating are extremely damning for [Martin Bernal’s “Black Athena” hypothesis](https://www.quora.com/What-if-any-is-the-part-of-truth-to-Martin-Bernals-Black-Athena/answer/Steve-Theodore), which sees familiar Greek culture as, essentially, a kind of Egyptian colonial hybrid: apart from _ai-ku-pi-ti-jo_ Egyptian loan words are basically absent while there are couple of Semitic loaners; IE roots abound.
