That’s an Apollo — almost certainly a copy of the [Apollo Belvedere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Belvedere) or something very like it. The Belvedere itself is a Roman-era copy of a Greek original but the odds are that this is a later copy of it, since reproducing it was a standard homework assignment for generations of sculptors from the 16th century on.
