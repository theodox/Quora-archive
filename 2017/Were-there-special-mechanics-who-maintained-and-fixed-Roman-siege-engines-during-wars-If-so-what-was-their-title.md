_Libritores_ “hurlers” or “throwers” seems to have been the main title for artillerymen, but there were also _ballistarii, “_ ballista operators”. _Funditores,_ literally “slinger” seems sometimes to be used for missile troops of any kind.

Ballistarii were at least somewhat specialized — we know that they were among the class of troops excused from foraging, camp construction and similar menial jobs. Generically an engineer would be an _artifex_ and it seems like that was used for the builders of other siege equipment, for example, so it’s likely that the mechanics (if they were different from the artillerists) were _artifices_ ..

Every legion had a _Magister Ballistariorum,_ ‘or master of the ballista operators’ but — from the title, this sounds like a commanding officer and not a technical job ( “master of catapults” would be _magister ballistarum)._ 

There’s a long tradition in the Greco-Roman world of specialist military engineers, usually selling their services to the highest bidders. Examples would include [Zopyrus of Tarentum](http://kotsanas.com/gb/exh.php?exhibit=1402002), [Philo of Byzantium ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byzantium)and [Polyidus of Thessaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyidus_of_Thessaly). They would direct the building and maintenance of siege weapons for their patrons. Interestingly — and revealingly — we know the names of several Greek ones but only one Roman: [Vitruvius](http://www.ancient.eu/Vitruvius/)., Even though Roman armies eventually fielded far more numerous and sophisticated stuff than the Greeks ever did, the subject didn’t garner much attention in Roman writing. Politics, generalship and glory were what counted in the eyes of the Roman literary classes.

We know Vitruvius because his book on architecture included a section on engineering in general. It’s quite likely that most of the supervising engineers were “mechanics” — generalist engineers who, like Vitruvius, handled things like laying out route march camps, building walls, and surveying roads in addition to overseeing the catapults and whatnot. In the republican period these were probably hired on an ad-hoc basis by the consul or proconsul commanding an army, rather than being attached permanently to a legion. In the imperial period the legions developed more organic capacities — their permanent camps were the nuclei of small cities with military-related industries (often run by veterans or their families) supplying food, clothing and so on. The practicing engineers in the Imperial period will have come from that those military communities.
