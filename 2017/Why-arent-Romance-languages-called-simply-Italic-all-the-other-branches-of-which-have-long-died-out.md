Italic languages already has another meaning: it’s [the ancient language family of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_languages), including Latin but also extinct languages like Umbrian, Oscan, Sabine, Faliscan and a few even more obscure ones.

It’s not clear if they actually share a common root or merely borrowed from each other, but — unlike French, Portuguese and Romanian — they were all localised to Italy.
