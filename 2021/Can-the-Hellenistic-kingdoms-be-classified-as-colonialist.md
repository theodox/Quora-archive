I think it’s better to say _colonial_  than _colonialist —_ though it’s always important in cases like this to put some brackets around our metaphors.

Looking at Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire, and the Greco-Bactrian/Greco-Indian states its easy to see analogies to the European colonial empires of the later 19th and early 20th centuries.

__Colonial society__ 

The most obvious similarity is the existence of a real, but semi-permeable, barrier between the “native” populations and their rulers: the mixture of exclusion, condescension, and occasional inclusion which marked the relationship between the Ptolemaic or Seleucid royal elites and their non-Hellenic subjects certainly brings to mind the British Raj, particularly in the more conservative era after the Great Mutiny. There was little question that these states were run by a Hellenic caste that monopolized positions of influence in government and the economy; the language of law and government was Greek rather than Egyptian or Aramaic or Persian. The bureaucracy was recruited from Greeks, whether at home or abroad: if you look at the list of Librarians of Alexandria, for example, you’ll find Greeks from all over the Mediterranean but no native Egyptians.*

Nonetheless (and this does feel a lot like the behavior of many varieties of later, “nostalgic” or “romantic” colonialism) in these states native cultures were respected and fostered so long as they provided a solid basis of support for the ruling elite. There was little effort expended on converting non-Greeks to a Greek ideological or religious point of view — in Mesopotamia and Egypt, the temples were favored clients of the new rulers who provided fairly lavish patronage in return for political support.* Native cultural expression that added prestige or legitimacy to the Greek rulers was encouraged: that’s why the Ptolemies were happy to appear on Egyptian temple walls as pharoahs offering sacrifices to the traditional Egyptian pantheon, and why [Antiochus I](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/attalus-i-soter/) used the old Babylonian title of “t_he mighty king, king of the world, king of Babylon, king of all the lands, provider for the Esagila and Ezida temples_ ” and “_first-born son of Marduk_ ” in the [clay cylinder ](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/mesopotamian-chronicles-content/antiochus-cylinder/)with which — like Cyrus three centuries before — he commemorated his dedications to the great temples of Babylon.

This adoption of native dress is of course an example of how you need to use the world “colonial” with caution: it fits with the pomp and Indo-philic trappings of the later Victorian Raj but _not_ with the mode of either the Spanish or English colonization of the New World. It’s also important to remember that politically, the Seleucids and the Ptolemies (and lesser players, like the Attalids in Asia Minor) were independent rulers — they had no political ties to a “mother country.” In this regard they are also reminiscent of multicultural kingdoms of the sword like Norman Sicily or crusader Jerusalem.

Both the Seleucids and the Ptolemies experimented with ways to consolidate their cultural and religious connections with their subjects in a more controllable form. The Ptolemies fostered the cult of [Serapis ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapis)as a visible expression of their bicultural domain; devotion to the god also doubled as a visible demonstration of dynastic loyalty. Antiochus IV tried to impose Hellenic culture (along with emperor-worship) as a unifying force — but that experiment backfired quite disastrously, triggering the revolt of the Maccabees and the loss of Judaea. Less famously he also inserted a Greek community into Babylon, [evidently in the face of armed opposition](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/mesopotamian-chronicles-content/bchp-14-greek-community-chronicle/).

___Social mobility___ 

For the most part, however, the Greek kingdoms avoided “missionary” activity, relying on the privileges attached to a Hellenic public identity to encourage their subjects to conform. This highlights another difference between Hellenistic colonialism and the 19th and 20th century model.

The last century of European imperialism operated in the context of a widespread ideology of European racial superiority. The Greek version was certainly not egalitarian: the distinction between “Greek” and “barbarian” was central to the Greek self-image. However, the contestable Greek definition of “barbarism” was looser and more flexible than most early 20th century assumptions about skin color.

There were definitely Greeks who believed that people of Greek descent were uniquely superior to other kinds of people — but there were also plenty of Greeks who regarded Graecitude as a cultural, rather than a biological marker. In many social circles as long as you could trade Homeric quotes at a symposion and were unselfconscious about wrestling naked at the local Gymnasium, you were Greek enough for most purposes.

This was not modern multiculturalism but it did mean that social mobility was possible for those willing and able to assimilate. This was not, however, a completely open door: it depended on the leisure and wealth needed to acquire a classical education. Even if an Egyptian or Babylonian peasant picked up the Greek language, the likelihood that they would be able “pass” as a gentleman remained miniscule. All of the individuals we know well in this assimilated class — people like [Apion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apion), [Lucian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian), [Philo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo), [Berossus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berossus), [Manetho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho), or [Philo of Byblos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byblos) — were representatives of the local gentry, people with means and influence in their non-Greek communities. Naturally, the patronage and privileges extended to these local elites were expected to translate into a stabilizing influence on the general population.

It is worth noting that this relative openness did not extend to the top of the social pyramid: the Greek world was always an aristocratic one and among the real aristocrats pride of birth and descent were highly exclusive — even among fellow Greeks. In Egypt and the Seleucid lands Macedonians formed a separate, privileged caste compared to other Greeks (one of the more peculiar controversies in late Ptolemaic times was the persistent debate about whether the Jews of Alexandria, who had a privileged community of their own but not traditional Greek citizenship,[ were or were not officially Macedonians](https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1171-alexandria-egypt-ancient)). In royal circles bloodlines were extremely circumscribed: both the Ptolemies and the Seleucids practiced forms of incest as a way of keeping the crown in the family.*** The [gymnasia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(ancient_Greece))and [ephebatic corps ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephebos)of the various Hellenistic cities within the kingdom were always the site of social struggles between blue-bloods who sniffed about aristocratic birth and newcomers (Greek or Greekified) who gained power and wealth in the service of the various kings. Native birth was of course a disadvantage in those settings, though a couple of generations of was usually sufficient to renderer it irrelevant.

__Culture, diffusion, and exoticism__ 

The colonial analogy — and yet again it, it has to be taken lightly — also helps make sense of the dialectical relationship between Greek culture and the cultures it coexisted with. Just as Indian tastes in food, clothing, and art made their way into British culture, the Greeks adopted and adapted the cultures they met in ways that might not be too shocking to people familiar with the history of 19th and 20th century [Orientalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism#:~:text=In%20art%20history%2C%20literature%20and,and%20artists%20from%20the%20West.). Exoticizing depictions of Egypt were a popular fascination, appearing in literature like the [Aethiopica of Heliodorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aethiopica), in visual arts in the form of Nile scenes like the famous frescoes in Pompeii, and the broad spread of the cult of Isis in Greece and Rome. [Many of our most eloquent Hellenistic paintings are actually mummy-portraits](https://mikedashhistory.com/2014/12/16/the-fayum-mummy-portraits/), a hybrid only possible by merging Greek representational traditions with Egyptian funerary practices.

One of the most interesting cultural exchanges that happened in the Greek colonial world was the Greek world’s encounter with Buddhism in Bactria and the Indo-Greek kingdoms. We have very poor Greek literary sources for this period but the [Indo-Greek king Menander ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menander_I)in enshrined in Buddhist tradition as the wise king [Milinda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milinda_Panha) who became an arhat under the guidance of the monk [Nāgasena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasena) — whose tutor, [Dharmaraksita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmaraksita) was a Greek Buddhist missionary in the service of Ashoka. We know from Ashoka’s edicts that he actively tried to propagate Buddhism in the Greek lands:

> Now it is conquest by Dhamma that Beloved-of-the-Gods considers to be the best conquest. And it (conquest by Dhamma) has been won here, on the borders, even six hundred yojanas away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule…

This cross-cultural exchange played an important role in the history of Buddhist art as well: [the earliest anthropomorphic depictions of the Buddha were done by Greek or Greek-trained artisans in Bactria](https://www.sunnataram.org/projects/alexander-the-great-and-the-buddha), which is why so many Buddhas wear Apollo’s topknot. It’s not impossible to find[ Hellenistic depictions in which Herakles is repurposed to become Vajrapani, the guardian of the Buddha:](https://greekasia.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-power-of-heracles-in-gandhara-art.html)

__Back-currents__ 

The dialogue between Hellenism and its cultural counterparts was not an equal one but it was somewhat more equal than the 19th or 20th century European version. However, it’s worth remembering that this was true only some of the time: the bitter experience of the Jews at the hands of the Seleucid Empire and sometimes the Alexandrian mob demonstrates that Hellenism was not infinitely tolerant of alternative belief. The [anti-Ptolemaic revolts in the early third century BC](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/files/TheGreatRevoltoftheEgyptians.pdf) also underscore the fact that — culturally accommodative or not — the Hellenistic empires were always based on Greek military supremacy. [The Jewish Books of Maccabees](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/hanukah-maccabees-and-apocrypha/) and the Egyptian [Oracle of the Potter](http://www.attalus.org/egypt/potters_oracle.html) give us a glimpse of what Hellenism looked like from the other side.

__Colonies proper__ 

One last dimension to consider when viewing considering the Hellenistic states as colonial enterprises is the colonists themselves. One of the great unanswered questions about the Greek kingdoms is the scale of Greek settlement in the conquered territories: none of these states left the kind of records that would let us gauge how many Greeks packed up and left the Greek homeland — which, it should be noted, consisted many cities sprinkled around the shores of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, not just the Greek peninsula itself — for foreign climes.

The first century or so of Hellenism did see unquantifiable, but large, movement of military men to the new kingdoms; in both Egypt and Mesopotamia the state settled mercenaries as cleruchs (land-owning colonists) to create a self-perpetuating military caste of reliable Greek manpower, probably between 50,000 and 100,000 in each case. In addition to soldiers there were bureaucrats-for-hire and merchants in search of opportunity who also settled down in the new states, which offered legal and political privileges to useful immigrants. Modern estimates for the Greek population of Egypt under the Ptolemies range from around 5% to 10% of the overall population.****

In any case, the Greek populations in both empires were always a small, if privileged, minority in the midst of big (and, for the Seleucids, very diverse) societies. Alexandria and Seleucia were monster cities compared to anything in Greece — each probably had more than 600,000 people. These cities were organized as traditional and ethnically exclusive Greek _poleis —_ but clearly the majority of their inhabitants weren’t ethnically Greek_._ 

Tensions between the great kingdoms slowed the flow of immigration before the end of the second century BC. While individuals continued to move around, large scale settlements stopped once the Macedonians clearly had a political hammerlock on mainland Greece. This loss of potential manpower helped encourage more open attitudes on the part of Seleucid and Ptolemaic high society towards native cultures and Hellenized natives, encouraging a gradual diffusion of Hellenic identities which softened the social boundaries over time. In both Egypt and Mesopotamia we see larger and larger percentages of the population sporting Greek names over time, adopting Greek artistic styles, and finding roles in the Greek-speaking bureaucracy. This didn’t necessarily mean they abandoned their older identities, however — merely that (like many colonized people in the 20th century) they learned to wear a second identity in certain circumstances. It’s quite common in Egyptian papyri to find members of the same household sporting Egyptian and Greek names.

One expression of that dual identity was the emergence of a small but notable literature intended to promote the identities and traditions of non-Greek peoples to a Greek-speaking world. All of the native authors listed above wrote histories of their own peoples intended to establish their longevity, their philosophical seriousness, and their own perspectives in the eyes of a Greek audience that was inclined to regard them as mere curiosities. The dynamic there will be eminently familiar to anyone who has observed post-colonial literature in the last century and a half. It’s also how, for example, [Greeks heard about the Babylonian version of the flood and the epic of Gilgamesh](https://www.quora.com/Were-there-any-surviving-records-of-the-Epic-of-Gilgamesh-before-archaeologists-found-it-on-baked-clay-tablets/answer/Steve-Theodore), and why, ultimately, we have both [Masonry and Wednesday](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-relation-of-Hermes-the-Olympian-Messenger-God-with-Ancient-Egypt-if-any-at-all/answer/Steve-Theodore).

So, to answer the original question:

Yes, it makes sense to see the Hellenistic kingdoms (at least, the Ptolemaic, Seleucid and Bactrian ones) as colonial enterprises. It’s important not to run too far with that analogy — in a world without printing presses and railroads cultural diffusion was much slower and more localized than it was in the British Raj or French Morocco. Both the imposition of the hegemonic powers and the reflux of local influences took place over centuries rather than decades. In many places (the poorly documented eastern parts of the Seleucid realm, the debatable border lands of the Arab peninsula and the Libyan desert) the Hellenistic kingdoms resembled the old Persian empire : they operated as basically large-scale protection rackets, extorting tribute and military support but otherwise leaving only minimal impressions on the local people. Nonetheless, in the urban centers its possible to see a situation whose complexities, reverberations, and inequalities would have been instantly familiar to Hubert Lyautey or Rudyard Kipling.

On the other hand — as [Coby Lubliner](https://www.quora.com/profile/Coby-Lubliner) correctly notes in the comments — one important distinction is that the these regimes were all independent of any “home country”. While the far-flung Greeks of the Hellenistic eras resemble their European imitators in many respects, none of these kingdoms reported home to “Greece” or some other metropolitan power after Alexander’s death. They were in that sense more similar to the Norman kingdoms of the high middle ages than the well-controlled colonial empires of the 19th and 20th centuries.



* Eratosthenes was born in Cyrene — its not impossible that he had some Libyan ancestors, but [at least on his father’s side he was descended from the original Greek colonists.](https://www.quora.com/Was-Eratosthenes-of-Cyrene-Libyan/answer/Steve-Theodore)

** A different (also to be treated lightly!) analogy here is Post-Roman western Europe, where the Roman-era elite in large part found itself compressed into the leadership of the church at a time when the new barbarian ruling classes monopolized the organs of the state. Here however the long-haul trend was for the conquerors (already Christian, for the most part, though Arians) to adopt the religion of the conquered and eventually the two elites merged to form the medieval European noble class.

*** The Seleucids were less exclusive in this regard. Seleucus I married [Apama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apama), a Persian princess, during Alexander’s push to unite the Persian and Macedonian nobilities, and married his own daughter off to Chandragupta Maurya. Antiochus III married Laodice of Pontus, whose father was from the Persian Mithradatid dynasty (though her mother was a Seleucid princess).

**** The business of estimating this is highly controversial. A very conservative estimate that illustrates how hard it is to come by these numbers [here](https://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/fischer-bovet/100701.pdf). Numbers for the Seleucid empire are even dicier and harder to find.
