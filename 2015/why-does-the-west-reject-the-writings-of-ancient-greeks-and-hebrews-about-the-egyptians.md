Hollywood is bad stand-in for what "the West" thinks about anything -- they cast to maximize their expected profits, not to make historiographical points. Anybody with any actual interest in the subject knows that Egyptians didn't look like Europeans.

Of course, people are weirdly addicted to the idea that 'black' and 'white' are the only options here. It's pretty obvious from the Egyptian and other ancient sources that the Egyptians were visually (the genetics are even more complex and ambiguous) distinct from their neighbors in _all_ directions. It also shows, as an aside, that they went out of their way to distinguish between themselves and everybody else: if you asked them who they belonged to they'd be irritated at getting lumped in with anybody else: they were famously ethnocentric and disdainful of their neighbors.

DNA analysis, while far from 'proving' anybody's pet theories, strongly suggests that ancient Egyptians looked a lot like modern Egyptians. While we're worrying about people's historical biases, it's worth wondering why nobody ever posts these kinds of pictures in in these kinds of threads:
