Well, the Vandals were not exactly popular with the rest of the Roman or newly post-Roman world. Part of the reason their name is a synonym for wanton destruction is that they made a lot of enemies. They weren’t exactly beer-swilling berserkers of the furs-and-horned-helmets variety by the time they ended up in Africa, but they were one of the more aggressive of the Germanic groupings operating in the Roman west.

Besides fighting Rome itself, they’d also tangled with the Visigoths and the Suebi in Spain and Gaul. They didn’t bother with the pretense of “alliance” which the other Germanic nations inside Roman territory tended to observe: they were out for themselves. They took to piracy all over the Mediterranean (in Old English, the mediterranean is the _Wendelsea, “_ the sea of the Vandals”) — which of course earned them no friends. They weren’t afraid to use North Africa’s grain supplies to blackmail Italy. Rome — which could not possibly feed its peak population on Italian agriculture alone — was utterly dependent on regular grain shipments from North Africa; between Vandal piracy in the 410’s and 420’s and the Vandal control of the the great grain fields after 429 the city was forced to shrink as an alternative to starving.

They also did a bad job of conciliating their Roman subjects. Several of the barbarian leaders in the 5th and 6th centuries did a good job of co-opting and cooperating with the local Roman elites; the Visigoths in Spain and the Ostrogoths in Italy found productive ways of accommodating their Roman subjects. The Vandals didn’t have a touch for that. Like most of the other Germanic barbarians they were Arians, but unlike them they tended to be doctrinaire and they gained a bad reputation for terrorizing their Orthodox subjects.

So — all that explains why they were a tempting target: they were pretty unpopular in both the east and the west. Both empires had launched a (rare) cooperative effort to destroy the Vandals in 468, but it collapsed in the disastrous [Battle of Cap Bon.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cap_Bon_(468))

Against that background, it’s easy to see why the Vandals were regarded as enemies. The precise timing of Justinian’s war involves a little bit of Vandal politics — the deposition of a relatively friendly (and Orthodox) [Hilderic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilderic) by the much less palatable, ultra-Arian [Gelimer ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelimer)in a coup in the year 530.

However the timing of the Byzantine onslaught also owes a lot to domestic politics The humiliating end of the [Iberian War ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_War)against the Persians in 531/2 and the bloody [Nika riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nika_riots) in Constantinople in 532 left Justinian in a very shaky position. He needed a victory to shore up his very ambitious claims to imperial power. A positive reassertion of Roman power — and a blow against an openly heretical enemy, one whom the restive Monophysites in Egypt and the Levant disliked even more than they disliked the Orthodox — made for a very tempting target.
