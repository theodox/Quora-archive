The 'Copts' were not targeted specifically; while todays' Copts are descendants of the Egyptian Christians of ancient times their modern identity is also shaped by centuries of Islamic and Arab occupation of Egypt. Egypt embraced Christianity enthusiastically, for several reasons. There was a large Jewish population -- early Christianity spread through Jewish communities first. Native Egyptians had no strong ties to the Greco-Roman religious traditions; the Ptolemies had tried to create a hybrid Greco-Egyptian cult in the form of [Serapis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapis) to bind their Egyptian and Greek subjects together but this was only partially successful: native Egyptians resented their Greek and Roman overlords as outside interlopers. Traditional Egyptian religion also had a hard time coping with the end of any semblance of native rule -- after Cleopatra, there was no one to play the crucial role of the Pharoah and the whole theological structure built up around divine monarchs did not transfer easily to distant Caesars (particularly the ones who came and went so quickly in coups and revolts). Religious difference was also a way of asserting a distinct identity in the cosmopolitan Greco-Roman melting pot of the Empire. 

There were several different waves of religious persecution in late Antiquity. In the second and third centuries, persecutions came and went irregularly and the reasons are not always clear to us. Egypt, with a large and enthusiastic Christian population was frequently targeted. 

In the early part of the period, Christians were sometimes targeted in confusion for Jews: the [First Jewishâ€“Roman War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War), the [Kitos War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War) and the [Bar Kokhba revolt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt) meant that Jews were highly suspect in Roman eyes. Egypt -- with a large Jewish population dating back to the days of Alexander -- saw a lot of fighting including the burning of Alexandria. Roman authorities were not always clear on the distinction between Jews and Christians in the early part of this period in any case and the general atmosphere of the times made it easy to whip up suspicious against anybody with heterodox opinions. 

During the 3d century, the empire was in constant turmoil : Many emperors came and went in perpetual round of military coups, assasinations, and failed revolts. Persecutions offered a convenient way for emperors with dubious claims to legitimacy to assert their status: the persecutions focused suspicion and hostility on relatively powerless outsiders, and also played to the prejudices and xenophobia of the masses. 

As time went on, several emperors also tried to create something like a centralized state religion that could enhance their legitimacy and bind the empire together more closely -- after the crisis of the 3d century, this seemed like an important way to keep the empire from disintegrating. Groups that refused to go along looked disloyal (again, the history of the Jewish Wars probably plays a role here) . The biggest persecutions came under emperors who tried very hard to enforce centralization and uniformity as tests of loyalty: the most enthusiastic persecutors were [Diocletian and Galerius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletianic_Persecution) who were, not coincidentally, committed to a pretty totalitarian reconstruction of Roman politics and economics at the same time.

The exact mixture of cynical politics, honest (if intolerant) belief, and simple xenophobia is pretty hard to tease out -- it clearly varied from individual to individual and group to group. In other words, not too different from modern persecutions of all stripes.
