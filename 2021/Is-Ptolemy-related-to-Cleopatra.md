You can’t get more related than Ptolemy and Cleopatra.

Grandson: __[Ptolemy of Mauretania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_of_Mauretania)__ __*__ 

Son: __[Ptolemy XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarion)__ 

Husbands: __[Ptolemy XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XIII_Theos_Philopator)__ ____ (fought a war with him) __[Ptolemy XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XIV_Philopator)__ (poisoned him)

Dad: __[Ptolemy XII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XII_Auletes)__ 

Grandfathers: __[Ptolemy IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_IX_Soter)__  and either____ __[Ptolemy X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_X_Alexander_I)__ ____ or __Ptolemy IX__ (again).

Great-Grandfathers: __[Ptolemy VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_VIII_Physcon)__ __, Ptolemy VIII__ (again), __Ptolemy VIII__ (again),__Ptolemy VIII__ (yet again)

From Ptolemy VIII you go back through Ptolemy VI, Ptolemy V (twice), Ptolemy IV, Ptolemy III (twice), Ptolemy II and ultimately [Ptolemy I,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter) Alexander’s childhood friend and the founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty. The only male ancestor in the 250 years between Cleopatra and Ptolemy I who was _not_  a Ptolemy of some denomination was [Antiochus III ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_III_the_Great)of the Seleucid empire.

It was an _uncomfortably_ close family.

If you prefer your info in video form, this is a pretty good walk down the very narrow lane of Cleopatra’s ancestry:



* Ptolemy of Mauretania ought to be adopted by fans of the “[African Cleopatra](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-inappropriate-for-a-white-actress-to-play-Cleopatra-since-she-was-Egyptian/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=73e98f4e&srid=zLvM)” hypothesis — which of course pretty dubious for reasons that should be obvious from the family trees above. Ptolemy of Mauretania was Cleopatra’s grandson, via her daughter [Cleopatra Selene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_Selene_II) and [Juba II of Mauretania.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba_II) Juba ruled over “Moors” (that, is Mauri: the people of Mauretania: most of modern Morocco and western Algeria) though he was a [Numidian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numidia)by birth.
