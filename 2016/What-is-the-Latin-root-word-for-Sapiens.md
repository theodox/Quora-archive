_Sapiens_  is the participial form of the verb [sapio](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=sapere&la=la#lexicon) (infinitive _sapere)._ It’s an interesting choice for the qualifier for humans. We use it that way for “wise” or “knowing,” a sense that it got in Latin as a stand in for the Greek __[σοφός](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=sofo%2Fs&la=greek#lexicon)__ ____ (the ‘soph’ in ‘philosophy’) .

However the alternate meaning of the word is ‘to smell or taste strongly’ (there’s a complicated pun on this in [Plautus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0103%3Aact%3D2%3Ascene%3D6)). Thus, _Homo Sapiens_  could mean _Man, the knower_  or _Man, the savory_ or even _Man, the smelly._
