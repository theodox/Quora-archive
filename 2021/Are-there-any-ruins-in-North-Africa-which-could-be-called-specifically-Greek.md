Quite a few.

“North Africa” of course includes __Egypt__ , which was a under Greek political control, in the form of the Ptolemaic dynasty, for more than three centuries and retained a thick Greek veneer until the Arab invasions more than half a millennium later. The most famous site is [Alexandria,](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/raising-alexandria-151005550/) the home of the Ptolemies, the lost tomb of Alexander the Great, and the famous library — but the Ptolemaic dynasty built up and down the Nile.

Sometimes they built in the familiar Greek style:

Often however they borrowed elements of traditional Egyptian style: the Ptolemaic regime liked to appropriate Egyptian imagery to bolster it’s legitimacy. The famous [Temple of Dendur](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/547802) — the capstone of the Egyptian collection at the Metropolitan Museum in New York — isn’t strictly Greek, but it was built only a couple of decades after the Romans replacec the Ptolemies. The hieroglyphic inscriptions include terms transliterated from Greek

A lot of the most interesting Greek ruins in Egypt are actually underwater: Alexandria was savaged by a huge tsunami in the year 365, and many of its Greek ruins are actually underwater:

But even before the Alexander showed up to drive out the Persians (332 BC) and take over as a self-appointed son of Ammon, there were long-standing Greek settlements in Egypt: [Heracleion-Thonis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracleion) and [Naucratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naucratis) were places where Greek traders and mercenaries where invited by the last native Pharaohs (roughly, 665–525 BC) . These are interesting sites which show the cultural cross-pollination between Greeks and a still-independent Egypt.

Egypt was not the only part of North Africa with a Greek footprint. There were a network of Greek colonies in [Cyrenaica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica) (modern eastern Libya) which date back to the 7th century BC. The most famous of the five city-states in the area was [Cyrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrene,_Libya), a prosperous town near what’s now Shahat, Libya. Cyrene was famous for agricultural prosperity and it’s supply of [silphium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silphium), a now extinct plant which had a good reputation for its medical properties and which was believed to be a contraceptive.

Cyrene was a produced a few Greek celebrities, in particular the mathematician [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes) who famously came up with a very good estimate for the size of the earth. The ruins of Cyrene are a well-known world heritage site.

Cyrene was an early conduit for Egyptian culture and ideas to reach Greece. The Cyreneans pioneered a mix-and-match approach to Egyptian culture, borrowing Egyptian motifs and stories or adapting Greek ideas to match Egyptian concerns. The famous coin of Alexander the Great with Ram’s horns — signifying his relationship to the Egyptian god Amun, identified with Zeus — borrows the idea from a Cyrenean original:
