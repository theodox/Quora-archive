Rather than PyGame, I'd try [kivy](https://kivy.org/docs/guide/android.html), which not only does graphics but also provides support for touch input. You will still have to code carefully to keep perf up but it should be doable. There's an example project here: [[Tutorial] Flappy Ship, a step-by-step guide to making an android game: Part 1](https://kivyspacegame.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/flappy-ship-a-step-by-step-game-tutorial-part-1/)
