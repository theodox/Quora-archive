In theory, at least, the Empire was divided to improve communications and military response to external threats. The Romans had a tough, in fact an insoluble problem to deal with: for centuries, powerful generals had used the backing of their armies to vie for the throne: this meant that any emperor who wanted to die in his bed had to keep a tight reign on this armies. On the other hand, the key strategic frontiers: the Rhine, Danubia, and the Parthian border -- were far from each other and very far from Rome. It is, to be fair, pretty hard to counter a barbarian invasion when it takes a month for news and directives to reach Rome from Sirmio or Treves: the [http://orbis.stanford.edu](http://orbis.stanford.edu) site does a great job of showing how far map-distance and travel time could diverge in those days.

_This map shows transit costs, not times, but they correlate pretty well. All that red means slow, walking-pace communication on less than perfect roads_  

So, dividing the empire seemed like a compromise: co-emperors (evenly matched, so unlikely to attack each other) could each watch the dangerous frontiers while civilian life could go on. As you can see, in this regard I agree with [Assaph Mehr](https://www.quora.com/profile/Assaph-Mehr) that the roots of the division go back to the crummy years of the the 3rd century. 

However I think there were underlying economic and social issues which also influenced the split more than the military and political considerations which he lays out. In the good days of the second century, the whole Roman world benefitted enormously from two happy accidents: First, despite all the shenanigans going on in Rome, the imperial government laid a fairly light hand on the provinces (lighter, by far, than the rapacious governors of the late Republic). Augustus and his successors reaped huge benefits simply by stopping the random expropriations and exactions which had troubled the whole mediterranean basin since the days of Marius and Sulla. Second, a long period without significant internal warfare (palace coups and _I, Claudius_ style madness are interesting but don't do much to your average Antiochene merchant or Gallic farmer) led to a huge upswing in the economy all over the Roman world but most particularly in the eastern half of the mediterranean, which was heavily urbanized, very mercantile, and positioned across vital trade routes. 

The west benefitted as well, but the prosperity there had shallower roots. The economic strength of the west was primarily in African agriculture and the metal works of Spain and Britain. Ancient economics was pretty different from our brand: it was much, much harder to make a fortune trading in bulk commodities than in small, portable luxuries. Silk, jewelry, glassware and other luxury items were the way to make a fortune if you were a trader; carrying ore, grain or animals was a low margin business. You might prosper as a farmer if you were lucky enough to have a good sea route -- the grain of Africa and of Egypt, which was the only thing that kept Italy from starvation throughout this era, was a big commodity trade -- but the real routes to mercantile riches were through selling small, exotic commodities with a high value to weight ratio. 

Most of those originated in the eastern empire, or even farther east. The west was a net consumer and essentially a net debtor. This was exacerbated -- quite a lot -- by the fact that the Romans never really figured out how to exploit northern European agriculture to its fullest. They brought mediterranean attitudes about crops and plantation patterns to a very different environment: for example, Italy was vastly more populous under Rome than it was to be until the 18th century, but France in 1200 was probably twice as populous as it was under the Romans thanks to (often overlooked) medieval innovations in agriculture. 

The net result; in the Roman period, this meant that the western half of the empire was much more rural, and poorer than the rest of the empire. The prosperity of Rome itself was deceptive, since it was primarily based on the profits of empire (and of course, as the emperors spent less and less time there that kind of prosperity began to fade). 

 During the good times this division could be disguised, but when things began to fall apart in the third centuries that underlying fault line was exposed: one consistent theme of that period is face-offs between armies from Gaul and armies from Thrace or the Danube. The two main military commands of the empire recruited from different areas and tended to be loyal to leaders with strong local connections. One of the reasons Diocletian instituted the Tetrarchy was to try to defuse those east-west tensions by creating a formal organization to encompass them: working with rather than against the grain of the times.

Unfortunately Diocletian -- whose instincts were those of a battlefield commander, not a civilian politician -- settled on a solution for the empire's problems that created a very dangerous dynamic. He attempted to impose sweeping centralized control of the economy in order to bolster the empire's defenses (which were, to be fair, under significant pressure in the Balkans, the first trickle of what would become a flood in the 5th century). Unfortunately his plans -- which included price controls, forcing workers into hereditary professions, and aggressive taxation -- also exaggerated the east/west divide. 

The rules and regulations bit hardest in the cities, where there were plenty of local aristocrats who could be dragooned into enforcing them (though they tried, mightily, to get out of the privilege). In the countryside -- where the local landlords were also the local taxmen but where they weren't packed together, it was far easier to cheat: to pay your workers in kind instead of in cash, to fudge the amount of land under cultivation, and to work 'off the books' by avoiding the taxable imports and making more things close to home. Diocletian had unwittingly re-introduced feudalism into a Roman world that had been a bustling, commercial economy. 

This rendered the western half of the empire --which was more rural to begin with -- increasingly less taxable and thus less defensible. In the more populous east it was harder to escape the tax man, and the result was instead the growth of the highly bureaucratic, stratified society that eventually became known as Byzantium: the city aristocrats couldn't escape the imperial bureaucracy, so they instead co-opted it.

These changes took centuries to play out, but they were inexorable. The late Romans were, as always, plagued by factional politics and betrayals at the imperial level in any case: usurpers and pretenders came and went quite frequently after Diocletian, although never with quite the dizzying rapidity of the 3rd century. The growing cultural estrangement between East and West added to the pre-existing talent for double-dealing: when the Visigoths were camped outside of Rome, the eastern Emperor sent a paltry 4000 troops to the aid of the city (and it's hardly clear that their orders included saving the city: they didn't do much of note, and the western Emperor, Honorius, hadn't been particularly energetic in assisting the East against the same Visigoths when they ravaged Greece in the 390's). 

So: the division was intended as a tactical solution to a tactical problem, but it stuck because of a much deeper social and economic divide that continues to shape the different histories of western Europe and the eastern Mediterranean
