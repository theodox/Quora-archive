__Here’s the answer the Romans would have you believe:__

The shirtless fellow is [Cincinnatus](https://www.ancient.eu/Cincinnatus/). He was a nobleman, but a poor one: so poor he had to do his own plowing. But he was also a talented commander, and in a moment of military crisis the Romans made him [Dictator:](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/dictator/) essentially he was granted completely unlimited power to deal with the emergency. Putting aside his plow and taking up the office, Cincinnatus led the Romans to a speedy victory — and a generous peace treaty. He then voluntarily resigned his office and returned to his humble farm, not a penny the richer for his two weeks of absolute power.

Some people think the story is a myth, though it hits many themes that the Romans held dear in their self image. Other semi-legendary heroes of the Roman past were similarly public spirited and upright: perhaps the most famous example is [Camillus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Furius_Camillus), another dictator: a successful general, he was driven out of the city for political reasons. During his exile the city was [burned by the Gauls](https://www.ancient.eu/article/910/the-sack-of-rome-by-the-gauls-390-bce/), and Camillus organized the scattered Roman forces to retake the city — however even in this crisis he deferred to civilian authority, refusing to lead the resistance forces without a legal commission from the Senate, which was barricaded on the Capitol Hill.

The idea of the modest, public spirited man who serves the commonwealth and is able to resist the temptations of power excercised a powerful influence on the Roman imagination. Later Romans — even those like Sulla and Augustus who could hardly be said to be immune to the temptations of power — still regarded such Republican self-discipline as a core Roman virtue. Augustus — a successful coup leader and the richest man in the world — nevertheless devoted his life to creating the illusion that he was just another Senator, only doing more for the people because they asked him to. It took another couple of generations of monarchy to really bury the myth of Cincinnatus. It has had a long afterlife: George Washington dubbed his association of former Revolutionary officers [The Society of the Cincinnati](http://www.societyofthecincinnati.org/), both to boast of their contributions and to pledge their willingness to return to private life.

_PS for no particular reason, here’s an awesome photo of the statue of Cincinnatus in Cincinnati, OH during an Ohio River Flood._

__Here’s the__ ___really___ __most Roman thing of all__ 

The most Roman thing ever was _odor control._

_A_ batillum_, an implement for burning incense._ 

The Romans were nuts about smells — probably because of a candidate that I narrowly rejected in favor of this one, namely _[garum](http://www.coquinaria.nl/english/recipes/garum.htm)_ , the fermented fish sauce that the Romans used obsessively in their cooking. Between the fish sauce, the 57% of houses without running water, and the use of animals for transportation Roman cities were more than a bit… wiffy.

The Romans, therefore, threw themselves into the scent trade with unbelievable aplomb. Every year they burned incense in incredible quantities — for religious rites, for funerals, and for private parties: Pliny estimated the annual value of the smells-and-silk trade at 100,000,000 sesterces a year when a laborer made about 4 sesterces a day. The perfume industry was huge, wealthy, and politically well connected: when Nero’s mistress commissioned a custom perfume, knockoffs flooded the market but the good stuff could cost more than a year’s wages for an ordinary worker. Along with the perfumes were scented unguents (hair oil, in particular: the Romans were the original greasers). There were even heavily scented wines and food: moralists complained that scent-happy Romans would endure the nasty taste (and huge cost) of perfumed wine just to be sure they were fragrant inside and out.

_Roman archeological sites produce a lot of_ unguentaria_: little perfume and oil bottles_ 

Some Roman tombs included siphons so the relatives could offer perfumed wines and oils directly to the deceased:

Not surprisingly, scent was one of the pillars of Rome’s international economy. Nard from Nepal, cinnamon from Sri Lanka, frankincense from Somalia, and myrrh from Yemen commanded astronomical prices. Nard leaf sold in Rome for 75 denarii (two and a half month’s pay) per pound. The Jewish kingdom of Judea maintained the [world’s only balsam plantation](https://www.ft.com/content/24347478-3e34-11e2-91cb-00144feabdc0); the profits of this operation were enough to maintain two full legions. When Vespasian subdued Judea, balsam shrubs were paraded in Rome as part of this triumph alongside the furnishings of the Temple.

_The reach of the Roman spice and incense trade_ 

So, that’s the most Roman thing ever: scented pomade and enough incense to furnish a dorm room stretching from Scotland to Syria.
