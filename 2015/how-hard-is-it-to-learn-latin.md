_Structurally_  it's not too bad if you have a good grasp of the grammar of any modern European language. The way you distinguish between, say, the subject and object of a sentence in Latin is different than in English, French or German -- but the actual concepts map onto each other pretty well. The set of tenses and basic constructions are not too broadly different. The whole study of grammar in the European world was basically invented by people who used Latin as a yardstick, so if you know grammar fairly well you've already absorbed several key ideas.

Like any language there is a lot of _memorization_ . It's made a little harder by the fact that Latin has a fair share of irregular verbs and camouflagued endings: For example words ending in _-us_  are masculine and take masculine adjectives, but then along comes a word like _virtus_  which means "manliness", yet is feminine, and goes with feminine adjectives. It is pretty arbitrary and highly annoying -- but not really any moreso than English spelling rules. 

If you have a strong English vocabulary (or a good higher-education level knowledge of any Romance language like Italian, French or Spanish) you'll have an easier time since many words will be familiar. 

Generally a year will get you able to decipher short prose pieces snippets of poetry. It will will also let you reel off short quotations and spot the structure and basic meaning of inscriptions or phrases but might not be enough to pick up a serious book like Livy or Virgil and start reading, as opposed to just de-crypting. It its pretty hard to get by without a good dictionary but luckily nowadays there are great online resources -- and anything interesting you'd ever want to read is probably just a hyperlink away, complete with notes and vocabulary. The Perseus Project at Tufts is a great resource. If you're a (physical) bookish type the [Loeb's Classical Library](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/collection.php?cpk=1031) offers most of the key works with English on one page and Latin on the facing page, a great tool for slogging through tricky bits.

It's a great exercise and will also teach you a lot about many things besides Rome -- the history of science, for example, is a lot more vivid if you can read Isaac Newton in the original, and much of Shakespeare or Racine will become more clear when you understand the Latin backdrop they were working against.
