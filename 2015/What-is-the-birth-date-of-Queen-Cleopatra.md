She is usually dated to 69 BC, but there is no recorded birthday for her that in aware of. 
The Egyptian calendar did not sync up that perfectly with the roman one -- and the Roman one before it was reformed by Cleopatra's future boyfriend Julius Caesar wasn't particularly reliable either so you could take that plus or minus a year.
