This turns out to be a surprisingly tricky question.

Greeks living in Egypt certainly did — the home of Homeric scholarship in antiquity was the Library of Alexandria, and even the rubbish dumps of Ptolemaic Egypt are full of scraps of Homer on papyrus.

It’s also clear that Greek-educated native Egyptians were familiar with Homer during the Ptolemaic and Romans. [Apion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apion), for example, is most famous today for his anti-semitism but in antiquity he was a renowned commentator on Homer. Homer was the central cultural touchstone of a Greek education, so anybody who wanted to establish their Hellenic credentials would make sure to become familiar with the classics; as an up-and-comer edging his way into the rather snobbish and ethnocentric literary world of Alexandria Apion made a smart choice in becoming a Homerist. However, there’s no unambiguous evidence for Egyptians being familiar with Homer before Alexander’s conquests of Egypt — certainly nothing like a translation of the Iliad into Demotic or anything like that.

There is, however, this _very_ interesting little bit in Herodotus, [book 2, starting at chapter 112](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/2B*.html) (I’m quoting at length because it’s a bit involved; emphases mine)

> When I enquired of the [Egyptian] priests,__they told me that this was the story of Helen__ :

> After carrying off Helen from Sparta, Alexandrus [= Paris] sailed away for his own country; violent winds caught him in the Aegean, and drove him into the Egyptian sea; whence (the wind not abating) he came to Egypt, to the mouth of the Nile called the Canopic mouth, and to the Salting-places. Now there was on the coast (and still is) a temple of Heracles; where if a servant of any man take refuge and be branded with certain sacred marks in token that he delivers himself to the god, such an one may not be touched. This law continues to‑day the same as it has ever been from the first. Hearing of the temple law, certain of Alexandrus' servants separated themselves from him, threw themselves on the mercy of the god, and brought an accusation against Alexandrus with intent to harm him, telling all the story of Helen and the wrong done to Menelaus. They laid this accusation before the priests and the warden of the Nile mouth, whose name was Thonis.

> When Thonis heard it, he sent this message with all speed to Proteus at Memphis: "There has come hither a Teucrian stranger who has done great wrong in Hellas. He has deceived his host and robbed him of his wife, and brought her hither driven to your country by the wind, with very great store of wealth besides. Shall we suffer him to sail away unharmed, or take away from him that which he has brought?" Proteus sent back this message: "Whoever be this man who has done a wrong to his own host, seize him and bring him to me, that I may know what he will say."

> Hearing this, Thonis seized Alexandrus and held his ships there, and presently brought him with Helen and all the wealth, and the suppliants therewith, to Memphis. All having come thither, Proteus asked Alexandrus who he was and whence he sailed; Alexandrus told him of his lineage and the name of his country, and of his voyage, whence he sailed. Then Proteus asked him whence he had taken Helen; Alexandrus made no straightforward or truthful answer; but the men who had taken refuge with the temple disproved his tale, and related the whole story of the wrongful act. When all was said, Proteus thus gave sentence: — "Were I not careful to slay no stranger who has ever been caught by the wind and driven to my coasts, I would have avenged that Greek upon you; seeing that, O basest of men! you have done foul wrong to him who hospitably entrusted you, and have entered in to the wife of your own host. Nay, and this did not suffice you; you made her to fly with you and stole her away. Nor was even this enough, but you have come hither with the plunder of your host's house. Now, therefore, since I am careful to slay no stranger, I will not suffer you to take away this woman and these possessions; I will keep them for the Greek stranger, till such time as he shall himself come to take them away; but as for you and the companions of your voyage, I warn you to depart from my country else whither within three days, else I will deal with you as with enemies."

> This, by what the priests told me, was the manner of Helen's coming to Proteus. And, to my thinking, Homer too knew this story; but seeing that it suited not so well with epic poetry as the tale of which he made use, he rejected it of set purpose, showing withal that he knew it. This is plain, from the passage in the Iliad (and nowhere else does he return to the story) where he relates the wanderings of Alexandrus, and show how he with Helen was carried out his course, among other places, to Sidon in Phoenice.

> _[Homeric quotation omitted]_ 

> In these verses the poet shows that he knew of Alexandrus' wanderings to Egypt; for Syria borders on Egypt, and the Phoenicians, to whom Sidon belongs, dwell in Syria.

> _[A side note about another poem omitted]_ 

> But __when I asked the priests whether the Greek account of the Trojan business were vain or true, they gave me the following answer__ , saying that they had inquired and knew what Menelaus himself had said: — After the rape of Helen, a great host of Greeks came to the Teucrian land on Menelaus' behalf. Having there disembarked and encamped, they sent to Ilion messengers, of whom Menelaus himself was one. These, on coming within the city walls, demanded restitution of Helen and the possessions which Alexandrus had stolen from Menelaus and carried off, and reparation besides for the wrong done; but the Teucrians then and ever afterwards declared, with oaths and without, that neither Helen nor the goods claimed were with them, she and they being in Egypt; nor could they (so they said) justly make reparation for what was in the hands of the Egyptian king Proteus. But the Greeks thought that the Trojans mocked them, and therewith besieged the city, till they took it; and it was not till they took the fortress and found no Helen there, and heard the same declaration as before, that they gave credence to the Trojans' first word and so sent Menelaus himself to Proteus.

> Menelaus then came to Egypt and went up the river to Memphis; there, telling the whole truth of what had happened, he was very hospitably entertained and received back Helen unharmed and all his possession withal. Yet, albeit so well entreated, Menelaus did the Egyptians a wrong. For when he would have sailed away he was stayed by stress of weather; and this hindrance continuing for long, he devised and did a forbidden deed, taking two children of the land and sacrificing them. When it was known that he had so done, the people hated and pursued him, and he fled away with his ships to Libya; and whither he thence betook himself the Egyptians could not say. The priests told me that they had learnt some of this tale by inquiry, but that they spoke with exact knowledge of what had happened in their own country.

> So much was told me by the Egyptian priests. For myself, I believe their story about Helen

The story of the “false Helen,” was not just Herodotus riffing; it had a long afterlife in Greek literature, including most famously the [Helen of Euripides](https://www.ancient-literature.com/greece_euripides_helen.html). Even Greeks who preferred the canonical version were well aware of this variant tradition. Plato, for example approved of the more moral version of the story, here in Phaedrus 243:

> "For those who have sinned in the telling of myths there is an ancient purification, known not to Homer but to [Stesichorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stesichorus); when he was blinded because of his slander of Helen he was not unaware of the reason like Homer, but being devoted to the Muses recognized the cause and immediately wrote,

> _That story is not true.
 You [Helen] never sailed in the benched ships.
 You never went to the city of Troy."_ 

The Roman-era write Dio Chrysostom [claims to have gotten substantially the same story as Herodotus from an Egyptian priest, ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/11*.html)though the echoes of Herodotus, Stesichorus and Plato there make it sound more like a rhetorical flight of fancy than a sober first-person narration.

_This Roman-era illustration (Photo:_ _[Jastrow](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Jastrow)_ _) of the fall of Troy bears the legend “The fall of Troy according to Stesichorus.”_ 

Herodotus is, nevertheless, an ambiguous witness. Even in antiquity there was a cottage industry debunking some of his pronouncements — though [many of his more surprising claims have later turned out to be correct. ](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/mar/17/nile-shipwreck-herodotus-archaeologists-thonis-heraclion)So we can’t simply take Herodotus completely at face value here and assume that your average Egyptian priest could swap quotes with the local rhapsodes.

So, what does this story tell us about how Homer’s stories were received in Egypt two centuries before Alexander?

One thing that’s obvious in this story is the divergence between the version Herodotus puts in the mouth of his Egyptian priests and the canonical text of the Iliad. It’s true that around the time of his visit to Egypt (about the middle of the 5th century BC) may not have yet been edited down to their familiar forms.* However the Egyptian “version” undercuts the entire point of the Iliad, so it seems unlikely to represent a one of the many local Greek versions which Greek scholars would later go to such lengths to unify. Oral traditions — and at this stage the Iliad and Odyssey were still overwhelmingly based on oral performances rather than reading — have a lot of variety. Still radical re-writes of familiar stories are pretty rare in a conservative oral poetic tradition.

However, Herodotus’ story includes a very interesting and telling detail. The Egyptian version is centered on Thonis, the Egyptian coast-guard. Thonis happens also to be Egyptian name of [Heracleion,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracleion) an Egyptian customs post which was also the port of [Naucratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naucratis) — the largest permanent Greek settlement in Egypt before Alexander. It suggests that “port of entry” for Homeric lore into Egypt was really the Greek settlement in Naucratis, where Greeks and Egyptians rubbed shoulders for about two centuries before Alexander added Egypt to his empire. Alexander’s [very clever politicking in Egypt, ](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised/answer/Steve-Theodore)incidentally, shows that Greeks were very familiar with and sensitive to Egyptian ideas and aspirations as well — due no doubt to the long tradition of alliances between Greeks and Egyptians against Persia dating back more than a century before Herodotus asked those priests about Helen.

The existence of that Greek entrepot in Egypt sets the stage for an Egyptian take on the classic Greek tale. It’s not hard to can imagine a mixed Greek-Egyptian population who had some familiarity with both sets of traditions, bilingual people who had a foot in both camps without necessarily being fully educated in either. Creole communities tend to be very good at mashing different stories together and finding ways to make a locally satisfying whole out of disparate parts.

In antiquity you can see this process in Italy, were Romans and Etruscans found ways to insert themselves into a Greco-centric set of stories and traditions. However the flow can go both ways: Greek’s recycled stories about humans like Croesus and Midas (borrowed from Asia Minor) or deities like Aphrodite (who shares some traditions with Phoenician [Astarte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astarte#Other_associations)). Hercules accumulated stories about the Phoenician Melqart — that’s why the Atlas holds up the sky in the Atlas mountains, part of the the Carthaginian hinterland in North Africa, not in Greece.

So here, you can envision (though of course, not _prove_ ) Egyptians and Greeks swapping stories in the alleys of Naucratis, finding points of contact and creating mashups with elements of both traditions. The Homeric characters, of course, are familiar, but the moralistic element in Herodotus’ retelling is very Egyptian; Egyptian literature tends a bit toward sanctimony. The character of Proteus in Herodotus version is a Greek-invented Egyptian king, probably a distorted echo of a real Homeric character, a sea-god of the same name tied to a semi-legendary pharoah with a similar name_**_ . The whole thing feels (to me, at any rate) like what you get when non-elite versions of traditions mix and match in a multicultural environment. Purists on both sides will have sniffed about these kinds of mixings, but they are a part and parcel of cultural interchange in antiquity.

Altogether, it’s not likely that Egyptians “read” Homer. But they knew his stories, albeit at about the same level an American teenager knows about shoguns and the Shao-Lin temple — through the informal cultural interchange that comes along with commerce, politics, migration and war.



_*Traditionally, the first effort to ‘standardize’ and record the texts is ascribed to_ _[Onomacritus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomacritus)_ _about fifty years before Herodotus was in Egypt). More skeptical scholars put the solidification of our current Homeric canon in 4th and 3rd century BC Alexandria._ 

_** In Egyptian_ Prouiti _is “the sublime gate”, another metaphor like the “Pharoah”, which is literally “the great house,” ie, the royal palace. A lot of Egyptian stories involve shape-shifting magicians, and Proteus’ other identity (as the shape-shifting “protean” sea god) would be an easy match._
