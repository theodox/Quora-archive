As far as we are aware — though [the sources](https://sites.google.com/site/alexandersources/strabo/strabo---india) are very scanty — they did not meet in person before meeting on the battlefield. Alexander showed up on the Hydaspes in company with — and, to some degree, at the invitation of — Porus’s local enemy [Ambhi of Taxila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxiles), so it’s unlikely that a first meeting was going to go well.
