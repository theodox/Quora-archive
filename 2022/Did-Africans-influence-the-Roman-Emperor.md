“Africans” in the Roman sense — absolutely yes. There were five emperors of North African descent: [Septimius Severus and his sons, Geta and Caracalla](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/seve/hd_seve.htm); [Macrinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus), and [Aemilianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aemilianus). On top of those, the famous Marcus Aurelius was tutored by, and remained personally very close to [Marcus Cornelius Fronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Cornelius_Fronto) — about as much influence as you could ask for.

However it’s important to remember that the Roman view of the Africa continent didn’t extend much further than a few days inland from the Mediterranean sea — Severus was from [Leptis Magna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptis_Magna), a seaport in modern Libya. Macrinus was [Caesarea Mauretania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherchell) — another coastal town in today’s Algeria. Aemilianus was born on the island of Djerba off the coast of Tunisia. While there was contact with the rest of the continent (what they usually called “Libya”) it was much more limited by the Sahara and by local powers like the [Garamantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamantes) who controlled most of the cross-desert trade or the [Nubian kingdoms of the upper Nile](https://qr.ae/pvCplL). 
Nine times out of ten when you hear of an “African” in the context of the Roman empire you’ll be talking about people from what its today Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia or Libya. Those areas were very well integrated into the Imperial system — the emperors are only the most visible examples, but soldiers, bureaucrats, authors and philosophers from the Maghreb were active all over the old Roman world. On the other hand people from the far side of the Sahara were much common and remained “exotic” in Roman eyes.
