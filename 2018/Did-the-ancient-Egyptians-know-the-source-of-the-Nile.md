No. It was definitely a subject of speculation — there are a number of guesses that have come down to us, but none of them are particularly accurate and some of them are pure speculation.

Here’s what Herodotus, who visited Egypt around 500 BC, had to say:

> as to the sources of the Nile, not one either of the Egyptians or of the Libyans or of the Greeks, who spoke with me, professed to know anything, except the scribe of the sacred treasury of Athene at the city of Sais in Egypt. To me however this man seemed not to be speaking seriously when he said that he had certain knowledge of it; and he said as follows, namely that there were two mountains of which the tops ran up to a sharp point, situated between the city of Syene, which is in the district of Thebes, and Elephantine, and the names of the mountains were, of the one Crophi and of the other Mophi. From the middle between these mountains flowed (he said) the sources of the Nile, which were fathomless in depth, and half of the water flowed to Egypt and towards the North Wind, the other half to Ethiopia and the South Wind. As for the fathomless depth of the source, he said that Psammetichos king of Egypt came to a trial of this matter; for he had a rope twisted of many thousand fathoms and let it down in this place, and it found no bottom.

> By this the scribe (if this which he told was really as he said) gave me to understand that there were certain strong eddies there and a backward flow, and that since the water dashed against the mountains, therefore the sounding-line could not come to any bottom when it was let down. From no other person was I able to learn anything about this matter.

Greek and Roman expeditions only got as far as the giant swamps of the [Sudd ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suddhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suddhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudd)in Sudan. It’s likely that Egyptians, if they ever tried, didn’t get any further. For most of Egyptian history the path southward lay through the territory of the sometimes-friendly, sometimes-hostile rulers of Nubia.
