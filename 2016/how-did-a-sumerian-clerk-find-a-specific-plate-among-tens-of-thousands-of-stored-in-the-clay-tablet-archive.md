We know that in libraries, at least (which might not be organized the same way as private records) the tablets were stored upright at an angle so the first line or two was legible. They were grouped by subject matter as well. Later they added a clay tag with what amounted to ‘summary’ information for better retrieval.

In later, more developed archives they also stored lists of tablets — indices — to make it easier to know what was in a collection.

I believe that private contracts weren’t centrally registered, but stored by the parties under seal. Even in proto-cuneiform there’s evidence of sealed copies for verification of sales and so on.
