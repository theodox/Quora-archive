Hannibal’s family, the [Barcids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcids), had been prominent leaders of the nationalist, expansionist wing of Carthaginian politics even before the war with Rome, having been the driving force behind Carthaginian expansion into Spain. Hannibal’s father, Hamilcar, was a bitter opponent of Rome in the [First Punic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Punic_War), and he passed on his anti-Roman sentiments to his son.

Here’s the ancient version, c/o the patriotic Roman historian [Livy](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/livy/).

> The prime author of the war [between Carthage and Rome] was Hamilcar, [Hannibal’s father]. There was a story widely current that when, after bringing the African War to a close, he was offering sacrifices before transporting his army to Spain, the boy Hannibal, nine years old, was coaxing his father to take him with him, and his father led him up to the altar and made him swear with his hand laid on the victim that as soon as he possibly could he would show himself the enemy of Rome. The loss of Sicily and Sardinia vexed the proud spirit of the man….

> Smarting under these wrongs, he made it quite clear from his conduct of the African War which followed immediately upon the conclusion of peace with Rome, and from the way in which he strengthened and extended the rule of Carthage during the nine years' war with Spain, that he was meditating a far greater war than any he was actually engaged in, and that had he lived longer it would have been under his command that the Carthaginians effected the invasion of Italy, which they actually carried out under Hannibal.
