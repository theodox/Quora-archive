“Reliable” isn’t an easy thing to quantify.

Josephus occupies an interesting place: he’s essentially a Jewish turncoat, whose version of the war is intended to place the blame on the Zealots and to make the Roman response appear defensible. Our edition of the _Jewish War_ — note that Romano-centric name! — was his adaptation of an earlier version written in Aramaic for a Jewish audience outside of the Roman empire.

So, there are excellent reasons for seeing Josephus as an interested witness.

That’s not the same thing as “liar” — it simply means that he has a story to tell and he shapes his account to emphasize things he wants to highlight. These were primarily what he saw as the poor judgement of the Jewish rebel leadership; the tragic inevitability of the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple; and the sterling character of Vespasian and especially Titus — the Romans who saved Josephus after his capture and who remained his patrons-cum-captors after the war.

As s historian, Josephus isn’t famous for precision; oddly, he sometimes messes up details of Judaean geography. His numbers (like most ancient historical numbers) often seem impossibly high. His account of his own survival — he was a commander on the Jewish side early in the war, and was captured after what was supposed to be a suicide pact with his surrounded unit fell through — has been questioned ever since it first appeared.

On the other hand Josephus was a privileged eyewitness to the events he describes. He was a controversialist, and had to write for audiences which (unlike us) had alternative sources of information. And whatever his complicity in the Roman victory, he was clearly and permanently marked by the trauma: he’s not just a paid stooge.

But — more than anything else — he’s _irreplaceable_ .

His account is the primary source for this period. There are scattered bits of alternative contemporary evidence but they are simply less detailed and less comprehensive. There are good reasons to approach Josephus with caution — but there’s no way to write the history of the Jewish War and its climax without him.
