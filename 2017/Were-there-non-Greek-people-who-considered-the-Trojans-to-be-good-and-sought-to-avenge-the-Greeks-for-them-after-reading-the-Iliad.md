The closest thing to that would be the origin-stories that Herodotus recycles in the opening of his histories.

He shows, or at least purports to show, that in the warfare between the Greeks and Persians people from the east were happy to cite the Trojan war as an example of how the Greeks “started it”:

> The Persian learned men say that the Phoenicians were the cause of the dispute…. The Phoenicians came to Argos, and set out their cargo. On the fifth or sixth day after their arrival, when their wares were almost all sold, many women came to the shore and among them especially the daughter of the king, whose name was Io (according to Persians and Greeks alike), the daughter of Inachus. As these stood about the stern of the ship bargaining for the wares they liked, the Phoenicians incited one another to set upon them. Most of the women escaped: Io and others were seized and thrown into the ship, which then sailed away for Egypt.

> In this way, the Persians say (and not as the Greeks), was how Io came to Egypt, and this, according to them, was the first wrong that was done. Next, according to their story, some Greeks (they cannot say who) landed at Tyre in Phoenicia and carried off the king's daughter Europa. These Greeks must, I suppose, have been Cretans. So far, then, the account between them was balanced. But after this (they say), it was the Greeks who were guilty of the second wrong. They sailed in a long ship to Aea, a city of the Colchians, and to the river Phasis: and when they had done the business for which they came, they carried off the king's daughter Medea. When the Colchian king sent a herald to demand reparation for the robbery and restitution of his daughter, the Greeks replied that, as they had been refused reparation for the abduction of the Argive Io, they would not make any to the Colchians.

> Then (they say), in the second generation after this, Alexandrus, son of Priam, who had heard this tale, decided to get himself a wife from Hellas by capture; for he was confident that he would not suffer punishment. So he carried off Helen. The Greeks first resolved to send messengers demanding that Helen be restored and atonement made for the seizure; but when this proposal was made, the Trojans pleaded the seizure of Medea, and reminded the Greeks that they asked reparation from others, yet made none themselves, nor gave up the booty when asked.

> So far it was a matter of mere seizure on both sides. But after this (the Persians say), the Greeks were very much to blame; for they invaded Asia before the Persians attacked Europe. “We think,” they say, “that it is unjust to carry women off. But to be anxious to avenge rape is foolish: wise men take no notice of such things. For plainly the women would never have been carried away, had they not wanted it themselves. We of Asia did not deign to notice the seizure of our women; but the Greeks, for the sake of a Lacedaemonian woman, recruited a great armada, came to Asia, and destroyed the power of Priam. Ever since then we have regarded Greeks as our enemies.” For the Persians claim Asia for their own, and the foreign peoples that inhabit it; Europe and the Greek people they consider to be separate from them.

> Such is the Persian account; in their opinion, it was the taking of Troy which began their hatred of the Greeks.

The notion that the Persians — who, at the time of the historic Trojan conflict,* were half-civilized nomads on the far eastern boundary of the Assyrian empire, almost two thousand miles from the Troad — had some real sense of outrage over the wrongs of the Trojans is of course pretty farcical. If nothing else this account conveniently glosses over the fact (which Herodotus himself will go on to record) that the Persians themselves has conquered, without any particular pretext, the Lydian empire of Croesus where historic Troy actually lay — when it comes to respecting the dignity of northwest Asia Minor, the Persians had little to brag about.

However, considered as the fifth-century-BC equivalent of an internet comment thread it actually makes a certain sense: it’s schoolyard finger pointing and dredging through the past for any stick to beat the opposing side with. This account suggests how porous the borders of culture were — after all, how did those Persian wise men even know about the Trojans, or those Phoenicians about the legend of Io? It might seem absurd that a Persian _magos_ or a Phoenician sea-captain would argue with a Greek by citing Greek myths; in the 19th century, most scholars simply dismissed these paragraphs entirely out of hand for that reason. But you can see quite plainly here on Quora how people from around the world are happy to recycle bits and pieces of half-understood pop culture and history from far, far away as political bludgeons — it’s a tribute to the eternal human need to score debating points.

It’s worth pointing out that Alexander of Macedon used the same trick in reverse: he made a big point of his Persian campaign being a chapter in the ‘eternal struggle’ of east and west, and kicked it off with a visit to the tomb of Achilles on the plains of Troy…. He conveniently skipped over the fact that his great-to-the-fifth grandfather Alexander I was a Persian vassal who marched in the armies of the Great King until it was clear that the Greeks were winning.

* Assuming, for the moment, [that there’s a historical reality to the Trojan war](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-archeologists-think-that-the-Trojan-War-happened) it’s usually dated to the 12th century BC.
