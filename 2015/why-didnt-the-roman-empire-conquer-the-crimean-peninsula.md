The [Bosporan Kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosporan_Kingdom#Roman_client_kingdom) was a Roman client state from the era of Pompey, who defeated the [Kingdom of Pontus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Pontus) in 63 BC. It was actually part of the empire briefly, when Nero deposed the reigning king Cotys and temporarily included the kingdom into the province of Moesia (more or less modern Rumania). However the kingdom was restored in 68 and stayed a client state until it was overwhelmed in the era of the westward migrations, some time in the early 300's. 

Since the Crimea was basically a commodity producer rather than a commercial center, there was little chance of the Romans getting pulled in by commercial activity (as had happened, by contrast, in Asia minor). Since there was no powerful rival state on that frontier, there was no reason for the kingdom to be conquered as part of a great power conflict (as happened with [Palmyra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra)). The peninsula wasn't well suited to defend the Roman possessions in the Balkans, so it was neither strategically valuable (like [Moesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moesia&redirect=no) on the Danube) nor a source of possible trouble (like [Dacia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacia) on the other side of the Danube).

For all these reasons, it was easier to leave well enough alone. The Romans generally preferred tractable client kingdoms to conquest: a stable, friendly neighbor was cheaper than directly incorporating territories. As long as the rulers stayed friendly, this was considered easier than administering and defending the territory directly.
