Once, long ago, a few friends and I went skiing in Quebec. I had recently had a crash refresher course in French for grad school so I thought I’d try to manage the whole thing _a la francaise._ 

Not long after we crossed the border, and stopped to grab something to eat — being grad students all we could afford was a [St-Hubert](http://www.st-hubert.com/index.en.html) — “Quebecky fried chicken”, as it were. But I stammered my way through the ordering in French, more or less getting everything right. I turned to my friends with a triumphant grin while the cashier made change.

And then I turned back to the counter, took my change, as smugly said _muchas gracias._
