As the other answers point out, civilization means different things to different people so the answers can vary. 

The oldest recognizable signs of permanent human habitation and urbanization go back abut 12,500 years -- sites like [Jericho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho) and [Göbekli Tepe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe) both show persistent communities who had the resources to build permanent structures and enough surplus food and labor to support specialists -- however both of those sites also show that hunting remained an important component of the community's way of life. There are certainly other examples of permanent settlements from this same period scattered around, particularly in the region of modern Syria, Turkey, Armenia and Iraq.

 _Göbekli Tepe in Turkey is about 12,500 years old and is the oldest known 'monumental' structure. We can only guess what it was built for_ 

Unfortunately without decipherable written records we can't know much about these places. It's more common to list 'civilizations' based on the availability of written records.

The oldest political or cultural entities which left records we can understand are [Sumer](http://Sumer) and [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_Egypt) . By around 4,000 BC Sumer was organized into city-states (more precisely, [temple states](http://www.ancient.eu/article/37/)) which left a lot of records: first things like tally lists (so many sheep, so many sheaves of grain, and so on) and within a few hundred years actual writing. The unification of Egypt from independent villages into a centralized state, along with written records, started some time before 3200 BC. Scholars have debated the relative priority of Sumer and Egypt back and forth for a long time; because there's no single agreed on line for (a) what a civilization really is and (b) when a collection of tribes and villages crosses the line into a civilization, it's an argument that will probably go on forever

_The_ _[Kish tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish_tablet)_ _is the oldest readable piece of writing we know of; usually dated to the Sumerian city-state of Kish, around 3500 BC_ 

There's not a hard line dividing 'civilized' from 'uncivilized' peoples or time periods: it's clear that early Egypt and Sumer supported a mix of agriculture, and hunting, settled people and nomads for a long time. Writing clearly emerged out of older uses of symbols (paintings and drawing go far, far back before any of this - -but we can only admire, not decipher). A similar evolution into settled living and long-lasting political structures can be seen in the [Harrapan civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization) centered on the Indus Valley, which starts leaving visible traces around 3300 BC. In China the [Xia dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_dynasty) reached a similar stage sometime around 2100 BC.
