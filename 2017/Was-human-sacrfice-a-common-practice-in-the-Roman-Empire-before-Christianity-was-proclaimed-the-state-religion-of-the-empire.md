Human sacrifice was rare in historic times in Rome. But it wasn’t unknown.

The most famous recorded case followed the the stunning Roman defeat at Cannae in 216 BC, where Hannibal destroyed the flower of the Roman legions in a single battle. [Livy ](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy22.html)writes:

> in obedience to the Books of Destiny, some strange and unusual sacrifices were made, human sacrifices amongst them. A Gaulish man and a Gaulish woman and a Greek man and a Greek woman were buried alive under the Forum Boarium. They were lowered into a stone vault, which had on a previous occasion also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings.

A similar sacrifice was made a decade before, in 228 BC, in the face of a Gallic invasion. As [Plutarch ](http://www.bostonleadershipbuilders.com/plutarch/marcellus.htm)describes it:

> The great preparations, also, made by the Romans for war, (for it is not reported that the people of Rome ever had at one time so many legions in arms, either before or since,) and their extraordinary sacrifices, were plain arguments of their fear. For though they were most averse to barbarous and cruel rites, and entertained more than any nation the same pious and reverent sentiments of the gods with the Greeks; yet, when this war was coming upon them, they then, from some prophecies in the Sibyls' books, put alive under ground a pair of Greeks, one male, the other female; and likewise two Gauls, one of each sex, in the market called the beast-market: continuing even to this day to offer to these Greeks and Gauls certain secret ceremonial observances in the month of November.

You’ll note that (writing in he early 2d century AD, he writes “continuing even to this day…”).

The Romans were not consistent on this point — as you can see both accounts include condemnations. [Elsewhere ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0211%3Asection%3D83)Plutarch writes

> When the Romans learned that the people called Bletonesii, a barbarian tribe, had sacrificed a man to the gods, why did they send for the tribal rulers with intent to punish them — but, when it was made plain that they had done thus in accordance with a certain custom, why did the Romans set them at liberty, but forbid the practice for the future? Yet they themselves, not many years before, had buried alive two men and two women, two of them Greeks, two Gauls, in the place called the Forum Boarium. It certainly seems strange that they themselves should do this, and yet rebuke barbarians on the ground that they were acting with impiety.

He goes on to discuss whether the Romans thought there was some vital distinction between sacrificing to the gods and to the “infernal spirits” (the _dii inferi)_  but the truth was much simpler: the Romans disapproved of the practice in theory but fell back on it in moments of acute anxiety. They absolutely made a point of condemning it in others, but sometimes succumbed to temptation on their own.

The Romans definitely used denunciation of human sacrifice to make points against political enemies. They accused the Gauls, the Britons and the Carthaginians, and — with much less evidence —- the Jews, the Manichees, the Christians, and even the devotees of Bacchus. They also accused each other: the infamous [Catiline ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catiline)was accused of sacrificing [Marcus Marius Gratidianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Marius_Gratidianus), although that was probably a routine political murder — and, later, of sacrificing a slave to consecrate the beginnings of his uprising. Much later the unpopular emperor [Elagalabus ](http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/elagabalus.html)was accused of sacrificing small boys to the sun. [Tacitus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D69) reported that Tiberius’ henchman [Piso ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnaeus_Calpurnius_Piso)had resorted to human sacrifice as part of of a magical attack on [Germanicus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanicus)

All of these accusations had one thing in common: whatever their truth they were politically convenient.

Human sacrifice was officially made illegal in 97 BC as part of a larger prohibition on witchcraft and divination. Even so the practice persisted; writing in the middle of the first century [Pliny the Elder](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D30) claimed that _etiam nostra aetas vidit_  (“even our own times saw”) a human sacrifice in the Forum Boarium: right in the middle of Rome itself. The Christian writer Tertullian claimed that the practice was still being prosecuted as a crime in his native North Africa in the late third century — and since he made the claim in a work addressed to the Roman officials who were responsible for prosecuting the crime, it seems unlikely to be a fabrication.

__TLDR__ 

The Romans did not practice human sacrifice on a massive scale, like the Aztecs but it was a real, though marginal part of their world. There are some side questions — do you consider gladiatorial combat a form of human sacrifice, or the way in which a vestal virgin who broke her vows was buried alive ? — but the overall it was a shadowy and at least notionally “un-Roman” thing to do.
