In the English speaking world, anyway, it’s really just a matter of familiarity.

The Thermopylae story has been retold many, many times in most European languages (the first translation into Latin was done in 1474, the first English version just before 1600). So it’s a part of the background noise of a lot of English-language literature even for people who aren’t very familiar with classical history — rather in the same way that most English-speaking people have heard the name “Julius Caesar” even if they have no actual grounding in ancient history.

Most English readers, on the other hand, aren’t very familiar with the campaigns of Muhammad.

I’d assume, though, that the relative familiarity of the stories is different for people growing up in the Muslim world. And I doubt that in Iran, at any rate, the Spartans automatically get top scores.
