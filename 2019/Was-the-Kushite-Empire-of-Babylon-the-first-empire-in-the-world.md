The title of “first empire” is usually awarded to the [Akkadian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire), which included the site of what would eventually become Babylon.

You could make the case for some earlier polities in the same area, since more than one Sumerian city-state before the rise of Akkad had subjugated its neighbors. The best argument for giving the title to Akkad is that the Akkadian empire included not just other cities from within one common culture, but also foreign peoples and states like the Elamites and the Hurrians, but a good deal here depends on what definition you choose to apply.

In any case there was never a “Kushite” Babylon. Babylon had a [Kassite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassites) dynasty, but they aren’t related to the Kushites (who lived in what’s now Sudan).
