__Politics__ 

As far as actual territorial expansion goes, the farthest south was a brief occupation of the city of [Napata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napata), about 200 mikes south of the current border of Egypt and Sudan. That happened in 23BC. Most of the time the southern border of the Roman world was about where the current Egyptian border is. Traders operated along the Indian Ocean coast, probably as far south as Kenya, but not in huge numbers; there was more money to be made sailing east to India.

_Napata is about 200 miles south of the Roman border here_ 

__Exploration__ 

There are a few examples of Roman “exploration” south if the Sahara, but the information is a bit spotty. In those days cross-Sahara travel was very limited; the caravan trade was still far in the future, so the Nile valley was pretty much the only route (with one interesting exception, below).

Under Nero, a small party of explorers tried to find the source of the Nile (the Persians had actually tried the same thing some centuries before). Seneca wrote of it like this:

> I have myself heard from their own lips the story told by the two non-commissioned officers sent to investigate the sources of the Nile by our
good Emperor Nero… The King of Ethiopia [= Meroe] had
supplied them with assistance and furnished letters of introduction to the neighbouring kings, and so they had penetrated into to the utmost.

> "We came indeed," I give their own words, "to huge marshes,
the limit of which even the natives did not know, and no one else could hope to know ; so completely was the river entangled with vegetable growth, so impassable the waters by foot, or even by boat, since the muddy overgrown marsh would bear only a small boat containing one person. There," my informants went on, " we saw with our eyes two rocks from which an immense quantity of water issued."

This is usually assumed to be the [Sudd ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudd)in southern Sudan, although some modern readers try to place it much farther south.

In the west, in the Romans sent a small fleet to reconnoiter the coast of Africa after the destruction of Carthage in 146 BC. The Carthaginians had always jealously guarded their knowledge of the Atlantic seaways and presumably the Romans were looking to see if there were anything of compelling value now that Carthage was no longer a factor. The expedition’s roster included the famous historian Polybius, although sadly the account only exists in the form of paraphrases by other authors. The extent of the expedition is hard to gauge: he may have gone as far as Senegal, but the more conservative estimate puts the turnaround at [Wadi Dra’a ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draa_River)in Morocco.

Roman general [Lucius Cornelius Balbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Balbus_the_Younger) fought the [Garamantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamantes), who lived on the northern edge of the Sahara from modern Morocco to Libya. Some modern readers think he sent scouts as far south as the Niger river, but that’s a modern reconstruction [based on a very sketchy description](https://books.google.com/books?id=qJMTDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=pliny+balbus&source=bl&ots=XznEgpM-4f&sig=tRvr11cOL-OkupTzmHUuoN-2-i8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7tOacqffTAhVBT2MKHb65DoYQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=pliny%20balbus&f=false).

A couple of decades later, in 41, [Gaius Suetonius Paulinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Suetonius_Paulinus),* fighting bandits in Morocco, was the first Roman cross the Atlas mountains. He traveled southwest for an unspecified distance until he hit a forested part of West Africa — unfortunately the surviving account ([Pliny, Natural History 5](http://www.attalus.org/translate/pliny_hn5a.html)) doesn’t let us know how far he really went:

> Ten days' march brought him to this point [the summit of the Atlas mountains] and beyond it to the river called the Ger, across deserts covered with black dust occasionally broken by projections of rock that looked as if they had been burnt, a region rendered uninhabitable by its heat, although it was winter time when he explored it. He states that the neighbouring forests swarm with every kind of elephant and snake, and are inhabited by a tribe called the Canarii, owing to the fact that they have their diet in common with the canine race and share with it the flesh of wild animals.

A lot of modern accounts put Paulinus all the way down in Senegal, but others think he stopped at the Dra’a as well.

Some time after 79, Roman named Julius Maternus accompanied the king of the Garamantes (now friendly) on a military campaign to a place known as “Aegysimba.” The journey ended at a large lake and Maternus returned to Rome with Rhinoceros horns as souvenirs. It’s usually assumed that this trip ended up at Lake Chad, though (since the Sahara was wetter than than it is today) it could have been farther north.

__Geography__ 

There are a few places in the Roman literary tradition that have an approximate location, even though we don’t know exactly how the Romans or the Greeks knew about them. Most of them probably reflect records collected from sailors returning from trading voyages.

The farthest southern point in the Roman records seem to be “Cape Prasum”, which they mistakenly believed to be the place where the coast of Africa turned eastward and eventually hooked up with Asia. This is usually identified with [Cape Delgado ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Delgado)on the border between Tanzania and Mozambique. The island they called “Menuthias” is probably Madagascar. On the west coast of Africa there’s are a bunch of vaguely identified locales which probably extend as far south as Senegal.

I haven’t really verified how accurate [this interactive version of the Roman astronomer Claudius’ Ptolemy’s world map](http://members.casema.nl/h.vandeukeren/histotron/ptol_index.htm) is, but it gives a good general idea of what the Romans knew — or thought they knew — about the world to the south.

* In an indication of just how complex the Roman world of the first century was, the same Paulinus was governor of Egypt and also the conqueror of Boudicca, the rebel British queen.
