It’s a really remarkable piece — a testimony to international trade and cultural cross-currents long before the building of the first Pyramid. It’s somewhere between 5,200 and 5,500 year old.

The knife itself is a about 7 and a half inches long, with an ivory handle and a flint blade, carefully flaked to make a serrated cutting surface. It’s an extremely fine artifact: a pinnacle piece of what you can achieve without metal tools. An archaeologist might say it came from the [Chalcolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic) or “Copper Age,” before the wide diffusion of high-heat metallurgy — but it’s clearly reflective of much older skills. At the time of its making it was already a traditionalist artifact (copper artifacts have been found in Egypt dating back as far as 4,000 BC — centuries before this knife was made). Its archaic design may have had a ritual purpose: the knife blade is so thin that it was probably not of much practical use, but the workmanship and artistry show that it was clearly a prestige item.

The reason it’s famous, however, is the remarkable decorations on the hilt. The materials are indubitably Egyptian but the subject matter shows a very visible mix of Egyptian and Sumerian motifs: clearly, the artist was quite consciously incorporating a Sumerian design. In this closeup you can see the un-Egyptian headgear and hairstyle:

Compare that fellow to this roughly contemporary statue from the Sumerian city of Uruk:

As you can see, the model for the Egyptian knife comes from Mesopotamia, right down to that distinctive Amish-style beard. Yet on the other side of the knife handle you can see characteristically Egyptian motifs as well: high-prowed Egyptian boats and the characteristic “smiting” pose famous from the [Narmer Palette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer_Palette).

In other words, the artist was clearly familiar with both Egyptian and Sumerian art — a fact which provides some headaches for both Egyptologists and Sumerologists (or at least, for their respective cheer squads) because it adds complexity to the usual narratives about the early development of those two civilization. You could even [try to read it as a depicting a Sumerian-Egyptian military conflict](https://sumerianshakespeare.com/748301/748322.html), although the logistics of the time render that scenario pretty fantastic. The fact that the knife dates from the period when both Sumer and Egypt were just beginning to turn their pictographic accounting systems into writing adds an extra layer to the never ending debate about who invented writing first: cuneiform and hieroglyphics both clearly have native antecedents in their home countries, but the level of contact implied by the existence of this piece suggests that it might not have taken long for the idea of recording complete sentences to skip from Red Sea to the Persian Gulf or vice-versa.

The knife doesn’t tell us much about the nature or extent of contacts between the twin fountainheads of ancient civilization — but it’s eloquent testimony to their existence. It raises far more questions than it answers.
