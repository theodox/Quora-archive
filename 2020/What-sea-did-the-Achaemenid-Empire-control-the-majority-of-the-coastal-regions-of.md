It’s a bit of a trick question, really. You can find online maps which support a number of possible answers, but they are typically hand-waved to a large degree. Compare this (which is fairly conservative but pretty good)

and this, which purports to show the same date (500 BC):

The best — though somewhat dubious — candidate would be (appropriately enough) the Persian Gulf. The second map above exaggerates the extent of Persian control of the western shore — we don’t know much about the nature of Persian influence in what’s now Bahrain — but since the eastern and northern shores were under fairly close Persian control, as was the mouth of the gulf, it’s the closest thing you’d find to a Persian lake.

A second candidate is the Black Sea. The Persians did have fairly direct control over Asia Minor and could at least claim Thrace (modern Bulgaria) and Colchis (modern Georgia) as tributary. However the northern shore of the Black Sea, particularly the Crimea, was mostly dominated by semi-nomadic Scythians; you’d have to really start counting the miles along the coast to see if the “majority” were really Persian — the second map above is definitely over-optimistic regarding Persian control of the modern Russian coastline.

Likewise you could make a case for the Aegean, if you include Macedonia and the Greek cities of the Bosporus as Persian tributaries — though again, it would come down to a math question about the relative length of the coastlines of Greece, Asia Minor and the many islands. My guess would be that the islands would tip the “majority” out of Persian control there too. Here again, the second map includes a bunch of territory in Thessaly which was not really Persian in even the attenuated sense that Macedonia was.

So — apart from the Bosporus, wedged between Persian Asia-minor and Persian-dominated Skudra (Thrace) — the Persians’ didn’t really have a _mare nostrum_  to call their own.
