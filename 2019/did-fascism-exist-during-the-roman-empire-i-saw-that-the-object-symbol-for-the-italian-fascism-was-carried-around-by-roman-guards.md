Modern fascism — in its party-political form and not “fascism means any unpleasantly right-wing” form — originated in Italy. Being Italian, capital-F Fascism made use of Roman symbols and graphic motifs in order to wrap its political program in the mantle of lost Roman grandeur.

The word _fascist_  itself includes a sort of pun: in Italian _fasci_  used to be a common word for “league” or “union”. So it was a natural jump to combine the neutral modern political word _fasci_  for “league” and the ancient Latin world _fasces_ which referred to the bundle of rods carried by the guards of Roman magistrates.

Which produces things like this:

So, the ancient Roman symbol of political freedom was perverted into a modern symbol of dictatorship. The Romans had political problems of their own, but they weren’t fascists in any but the “I don’t approve of that” sense.
