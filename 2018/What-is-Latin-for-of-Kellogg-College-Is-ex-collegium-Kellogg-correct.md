[User-9938525219388766718](https://www.quora.com/profile/User-9938525219388766718), as always, has the good stuff.

The only thing I’d add is that if (as in the comments of his answer) you’re referring to a student of a given college you might want to use _de_ rather than _ex; de_ will emphasize current membership, where _ex_ stresses the credential — roughly, the difference between “student at X” and “graduate of X.”

So perhaps _Adam, discipulus de collegio Kellogge_ for Adam the current student, versus _Adam, discipulus ex collegio Kellogge_ for a graduate. If Adam’s a teacher, it would be _doctor_  or _magister_ or _socius_ for “fellow,” rather than _discipulus;_ most likely the _ex_ form.

A 17th or 18th century version for people trying hard to sound classy might be _Adam discipulus collegii Kellogiani_ , using the possessive instead of the preposition and using the _-ianus_  form to sound more like a classical poet dropping allusions.
