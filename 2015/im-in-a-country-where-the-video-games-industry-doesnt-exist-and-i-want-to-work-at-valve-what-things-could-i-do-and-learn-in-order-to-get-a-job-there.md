If you're a technical person, you can pursue advanced studies in computer science: high quality academic work in animation, physical simulation or networking can make you a good candidate. The typical pitfall here is that academic work often focuses on problems that are interesting rather than problems that can be solved in real time: an accurate and elegant fluid simulation technique that runs at 7 fps is unlikely to translate into a games job.

If your not technical, you could look at some of Valve's more unusual hires in the past for inspiration. "__I'm in a country where the video games industry doesn't exist, and I want to work at Valve__ " is a good description of [Yanis Varoufakis](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/economics/it-all-began-with-a-strange-email/), for example.
