Athenian citizenship was highly restrictive even by contemporary standards.

You could _marry_  anyone you wanted, but the children’s citizen status was dependent on having two citizen parents. In fact the technical requirement was for four citizen grandparents— there were cases where people’s status was challenged because of doubts about one of their grandparent’s status.

Slaves could not marry, though an owner could manumit a slave before marriage. However in Athens former slaves did not become citizens, so the children would be “[metics](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100154741)” or resident foreigners even if one parent were a citizen. Legally Athenian women did not have full property rights, so theoretically freeing the slaves would have to be managed by a (male) legal guardian.

After Plato’s day the law became easier to get around — richer people routinely became citizens by doing some kind of service to the city, usually something involving a large amount of money.
