Nothing beats practice, mostly reading. But audio learning is a really powerful supplement to eyes-only Latin — it engages parts of your brain that are often ignored in the usual print-heavy way the language is taught. A good audio course is a great supplement to the traditional textbook and dictionary approach. [Evan der Millner’s](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEekt9eu1g-yEGq6XUlRSIg) Youtube and Patreon are good examples of spoken Latin learning tools that can help move you from a being a decoder to being a listener and speaker.
