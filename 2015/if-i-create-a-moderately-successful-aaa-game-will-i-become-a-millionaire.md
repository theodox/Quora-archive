Nowadays there's almost no such thing as a moderately successful AAA game.

__Success is not a bell-curve__ 
Check out this depressing graph of metacritcs vs sales (it's a bit elderly, but if anything the profile today is worse):

That's almost a power-law distribution, where 10% of the games are making 90% of the sales. As you can see there are quite a lot of decently-rated games selling well under half a million copies.

You might think half a million is a decent number; at $60 a pop that’s a healthy 30 million dollars. However:

__Development budgets are very large…__ 
$20 million is a bargain-basement price; $50 million is more likely for a real "AAA" production (and of course there are behemoths like _Destiny_  or GTA that run upwards of $250 million to make).

__…and developers only get a fraction of the sales.__ 
Platform owners (Xbox, Playstation, Steam) take a big chunk (say, 20%) of that $60. For box sales, retailers take another 20% or so. Once those are paid, the publisher splits the rest with the developer.

However, the publisher won't pass _anything_  on to the developer until they have earned back their initial investment and then some (if it's your first project or you negotiated the deal from a weak position, that 'then some’ could be almost as large as the initial budget). But lets say its a 'mere' 50% premium. So the game needs to make 150% of its budget out of the 60% (= $36 dollars) before the developers will see _any profit at all._ A modest $35 million game needs to sell a million units just to hit break-even!

After a million the devs will get something like 25% of the $36 dollars (that is, $9) per sale. So a 2-million-unit seller will bring in $9 million in royalties: $9 bucks on the _second_ million boxes—bupkis on the first.

__TLDR:__ 
You need to sell about 45,000 copies for every million dollars of dev budget just to break even. A very lean, "just barely AAA" game with a $20m budget can be profitable at 900,000 copies or so, but a bigger title won't turn a profit for you until you hit two or three million. It's _possible_  to do very well in AAA games. But it's also _possible_  to make big money betting on horses, or playing for the NBA. Your odds, alas, are similar in all three cases.
