If you’re looking for real-world connections, find (or start) a local chapter of the [International Game Developers Association (IGDA)](https://www.igda.org/). Full-time devs and many people who on the fringes of the business: students, self-taught hobbyists, and indie developers — use the IGDA for exactly this kind of networking opportunity. Nowadays the IGDA meetings tend to be a bit ‘outsider’ heavy, professional devs — at least where I work, in Seattle — tend to stick to informal social events because it’s a bit exhausting being handed a resume at the end of every conversation. However that may be different in other towns, particularly those with fewer full-timers where the games scene is mostly outside the traditional industry.

[Game Jams](http://archive.globalgamejam.org/wiki/basic-questions) and [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2016/03/02/real-world-gatherings-for-ludum-dare-35/) meetups are a great way to meet people and particularly to evaluate them in a context that is very close to real development, complete with deadlines and pressure.
