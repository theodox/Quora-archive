Self teaching Attic is doable if (a) you have a reasonably good background in formal grammar in one or more in Indo-European languages and (b) you are reasonably patient.

The grammar part is important, because Greek is an inflected language — many important ideas which in English are conveyed by entire words are are represented in Greek by word endings. Among modern European languages German and Romanian are examples of languages that do the same thing — English, on the other hand retains only faint traces of this kind of structure: , such as the difference between “I” , “me” and “my”.

Greek also has a fairly complex tense system: in addition to the distinction between past, present and future, it also expresses different kinds of past action: past action extended over time is familiar in English as the imperfect tense (“he was learning Greek”) and past action completed as the perfect tense (“he had learned Greek”) but Greek also has an extra expression, the [aorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorist#Greek), which covers past action in a way that emphasizes neither of those two options… and can sometimes be used in the present and the future. Most of the time you can read it as something like a simple past tense ((“He learned Greek”) but it’s sufficiently unfamiliar that it can intimidate a self-teacher.

There’s a ton of learning material floating around. You’ll want to check carefully to make sure you are learning Attic — The many Biblical Greek courses teach the Koine Greek of the New Testament, several hundred years after the Athenian golden age and a somewhat different idiom, although there are a lot of commonalities.

This is a good textbook



And the publishers also provide an accompanying independent study guide
