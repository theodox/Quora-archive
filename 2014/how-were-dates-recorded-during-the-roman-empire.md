In the later Imperial era there was also a 'bureaucratic calendar', derived ultimately from the dating of the Ptolemaic kingdom of Egypt which was absorbed into the empire as a quasi-personal property of Augustus. Managing Egypt's grain harvest was probably the largest regular bureaucratic operation in the empire and many bureaucrats worked in the Egyptian civil service at some point, so it became a very common system for legal and bureaucratic documents.

The bureaucratic cycle was oriented around the 'Indiction', which was a mult-year cycle for recurring but non-annual taxes. The period was usually 15 years but varied over time (and depending on how hungry the government was for tax revenue). The indiction system became very widespread in both the Eastern and Western empires around the time that the Roman state began getting heavily involved in micromanaging local economies in the 4th century. Indictions were a common dating system throughout the next millenium of Byzantine history in the east; they eventually died out in the west as Byzantine influence declined. The system is still used for some purposes in Orthodox churches:

The Byzantines also used an 'Anno Mundi' date, based on a calculation of the date of the creation of the world from events in the Greek version of the Bible, similar to the modern Jewish calendar and the chronology of Archbishop Ussher.
