Yes, absolutely. The [Great Egyptian Revolt ](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/files/TheGreatRevoltoftheEgyptians.pdf)(205–186 BCE) is the most famous example of resistance to the Ptolemies, and it came close to upending Greek domination in Egypt.

The Ptolemies fought a century-long series of border wars with the rival Seleucid empire starting in the 270’s. Both empires spent lavishly on efforts to dominate the buffer zones in Canaan and the Levant, but neither could gain a permanent upper hand. The endless drain on the treasury and on the reserves of Greek soldiers in Egypt led the Ptolemies to add native Egyptian troops to their army for the first time since Alexander: the so-called _machimoi_ (“fighters” or “warriors”). At the climactic battle of Raphia (217 BC) the _machimoi_ played a notable role in the narrow Egyptian victory, undermining the stereotype that Egyptians were unwarlike and made poor soldiers. It’s significant that the victory memorials for Raphia include, for the first time, Egyptian as well as Greek version of the text. Although the Ptolemies had always used Egyptian iconography for propaganda purposes this is the first time that Egyptian audiences are addressed directly in a military context — moreover, in the Egyptian texts the Ptolemies are depicted using the traditional pharaonic motifs and references:

> In the year 5, on the 1st of Pachon, he moved out from Pelusium and fought with Antiochus at a city called Raphia, near the frontier of Egypt, to the east of Bethelea and Psinûfer (?). On the 10th of the aforesaid month he conquered him in great and noble fashion. Those of his enemies who were able to come near him in the battle, he stretched out dead before him, even as Harsiêsis slew his adversaries in old time. He compelled Antiochus to fling away his diadem and his royal hat. Antiochus fled with his (?) wife — there being but few that yet abode with him — in pitiful and sorry fashion after his defeat

This led, in turn, to growing self-confidence on the part of Egyptians, both among the _machimoi_  and among the Egyptians who staffed the low ranks of the Ptolemaic bureaucracy. Moreover within a decade of the victory at Raphia Egypt had a new pre-teen king, turmoil in the royal family, and another war with the Seleucids. Taxes skyrocketed as the shaky dynasty tried to finance yet another conflict, leading to widespread resistance in the countryside. In Upper Egypt this quickly metastatized into guerilla warfare. The would-be pharaoh [Horwennefer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horwennefer) and his successor [Ankhwennefer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankhwennefer_(pharaoh)) wrested control of large parts of Upper Egypt away from the Ptolemies for over a decade.

_Year 5 of pharaoh Hyrgonaphor [= Horwennefer] loved by Isis and Osiris, loved by Amon–Re king of the gods, the great god. A graffito written in Greek letters but the Egyptian language on the mortuary temple of Seti at Abydos. This area was mostly under Greek control, meaning this is probably a bit of “resistance graffiti.”_ 

Our sources for the war are very spotty and much of what we know is reconstructed from archaeological evidence rather than narrative accounts but this was a large and well organized attempt to return control of Egypt to Egyptians. It’s interesting to note, however, that some of the documents from the rebel-held areas are still in Greek, the only bureaucratic and legal language known to their authors. There are few hieroglyphic traces of the war: the rebels seem never to have had the resources to undertake the expensive project of traditional temple inscriptions.

The defeat of the Egyptian revolt (duly recorded in [hieroglyphic inscriptions at Philae](http://www.attalus.org/docs/other/inscr_260.html) ) cemented Greek political control over Egypt but it didn’t automatically reconcile Egyptians to Greek rule. There was another, much less dangerous rebellion in the 130’s but for the most part civil strife in Egypt pitted different factions in the royal family against each other, rather than Egyptians against Greeks. It’s actually a testament to the success of the Ptolemaic approach to the native population that they never faced another existential threat despite their addiction to fratricidal civil wars.

Nonetheless, resentments continued to simmer outside the political arena. A good example of how many Egyptians felt is the [Oracle of the Potter](http://www.attalus.org/egypt/potters_oracle.html), an Demotic Egyptian text from the 2d century BC which prophesies the end of “the sons of Typhon” — which is to say, the Greeks. It’s an interesting mishmash of references from both Greek and Egyptian culture (“Typhon” is Greek, although the writer is clearly thinking of the Egyptian deity Set — a traditional standin for “god of the foreigners”) and its written with a figleaf of deniability, nominally coming from the mouth of an ancient pharaoh. Nonetheless it is clearly a wish-fulfillment fantasy centered on the expulsion of the Greeks and that “_The city by the sea” —_ Alexandria _— “will become a drying place for fishermen.”_

_Proof that resentments can last a long time: a copy of the Oracle of the Potter written on a recycled legal papyrus in the year 284, three centuries after Greek domination had long been replaced by Romans. It’s written in Greek! Image:_ _[Oxford Papyrology](http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/VExhibition/introduction/potter.html)_ 

This kind of resentment formed a low-level background radiation for some centuries to come, even though it existed alongside more amicable relations. The privileged strata of Egyptian society were able to assimilate into the Greek sphere, and there were notable examples of native Egyptians who managed to build successful careers on the strength of their Greek educations. But for ordinary Egyptians — most of whom were essentially serfs, tied to the land an unable to move or change occupations — this was not an option. Meanwhile among the Greek settlers the less privileged or the more adventurous gradually assimilated Egyptian mores: the cemeteries of the Ptolemaic period include plenty of Greek mummies and the cult of Isis became a modish cultural export all over the Greek world.

So: the answer to the original question is a definite yes: Ptolemaic Egypt displayed a mix of resistance and accommodation that would be familiar to many colonial societies. That mix ran the gamut from armed resistance to graffiti and from a blanket rejection of foreign ways to enthusiastic assimilation.



> I went to Pysa … on a personal matter. As I was passing by [her house] an Egyptian woman … leaned out [of the window] and emptied a chamber pot of urine over my clothes … she hurled abuse at me … When I responded in king, [the woman] with her own right hand pulled the fold of my cloak in which I was wrapped, tore it and ripped it off me … O king … [do not] ignore my being thus, for no reason, manhandled by and Egyptian woman, whereas I am a Greek …
