I think [Tim O'Neill](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-ONeill-1)'s answer captures the gist of things: after all, not many Medieval painters would have been proud to put this on their resumes:

But -- unless you're a certain brand of Edwardian reactionary that doesn't mean Picasso didn't know how to draw: he was doing something else.

FWIW the modern method of linear perspective was given a systematic footing by [Filippo Brunelleschi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Brunelleschi) in 1425. Brunelleschi one of history's great hackers: he first invented device for maintaining a fixed eyepoint and allowing an artist to check their work against it. Here's a reconstruction:





 
This is a guess, the actual device is not recorded by Brunelleschi in his own words: as the holder of the [first industrial patent](http://patenting-art.com/history/brunel.htm), was obsessively concerned with intellectual property and didn't want to spread the word to competitors. Popularizing perspective fell mainly to [Leon Battista Alberti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Battista_Alberti), who was more of an upper-class literary figure. His mathematical and schematic description, spread by the printing press, enabled perspective drawing to spread very rapidly across Europe. 

One important side point about this is that many Renaissance artists relied on mechanical aids to get their perspective correct: This engraving by Durer shows one example:

The differences in taste and intention explain the important difference between the medieval and renaissance artistic worlds. However the easy availability of teaching materials and mechanical aids certainly made life easier for less-ambitious artists in the 16th and later centuries to create spatially realistic scenes, much as 3d computer animations always have correct perspective where an old-fashioned Disney animation shows many cheats and approximations. And of course, there's a chicken-and-egg question of how much the new tech helped create demand for it's own products -- certainly, it began as a startling technical innovation that carried a lot of prestige, which made it popular and thus created a market that helped in turn to spread the knowledge and skills needed.
