[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey) — anglicized as Pompey — was a very powerful Roman statesman and general in the first century BC. He was an older contemporary of Julius Caesar and, also, Caesar’s son-in-law. In his heyday he was the most powerful man in the Roman world.

Pompey became famous as a military commander, particularly fighting in Spain. He was illegally offered high commands at a very young age — his first battlefield command was at 21; before 30 he was the main Roman commander in Spain. He was a competent, if not a brilliant battlefield leader but he was noted for his superior organization, logistics, and administration. The best example of Pompey in action is really the [Pirate war](http://www.livius.org/articles/people/cilician-pirates/) of 67–66 BC, in which Pompey organized the suppression of piracy throughout the Mediterranean basin — a huge operation combining naval, military, and political actions on a scale unlike anything the Romans had ever contemplated before.

Because of his military triumphs and the wealth they brought, Pompey became the dominant figure in Roman politics from the mid 70’s to the mid 50’s BC. Pompey, Julius Caesar, and [Marcus Licinius Crassus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Licinius_Crassus), the wealthiest man in Rome [formed an alliance which dominated the waning years of the Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Triumvirate). They essentially ran Rome from 60 to 53 BC. Throughout this period Pompey was the the most important member of the trio — he had the most military glory, the largest political following, and a vast network of people who owed him favors.

However the partnership did not last. Caesar’s daughter Julia, whose marriage to Pompey was a public symbol of the alliance (and to whom he was sincerely devoted), died in 54. The next year Crassus was [killed trying to win glory in the Syrian desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carrhae). The relatively stable three-way arrangement was now a two-way race — and Caesar, who was [winning great fame and money conquering Gau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars)l, was clearly catching up to Pompey.

Pompey decided to back the aristocratic party in the Senate, which hated Caesar for a variety of reasons of their own. Pompey’s support emboldened them to try recalling Caesar from Gaul on corruption charges. He returned — but he brought his army with him, [kicking off a civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_Civil_War).

Pompey assumed command of the Republic’s forces — but these were scattered on the frontiers of the empire, not concentrated in Italy where Caesar and his army were. Caesar moved fast, leaving no time for the kind of slow moving, carefully planned campaign at which Pompey excelled. Pompey abandoned Rome, heading east to Greece in hopes of raising more money and men. Finally at [Pharsalus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pharsalus)in 48 Caesar defeated Pompey on the field, even though Pompey had, characteristically, a larger and better supplied army. Pompey fled to Egypt, hoping to rally more support, but was assassinated by an Egyptian faction hoping to curry favor with Caesar.
