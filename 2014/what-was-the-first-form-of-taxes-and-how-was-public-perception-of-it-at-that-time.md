Sumeria in particular was very tax heavy from the dawn of it's history. 

It's thought by some that this originated in the idea that the gods owned all the land, and the citizens were effectively 'tenant farmers' paying rent to the temples and later to kings. However this is mostly conjectural, since we don't have good records for the origins of the system. Other scholars think Sumeria started out as a kind of socialist collective with common property and that 'taxes' were just redistribution. That, too, is mostly conjecture. It's hard to get at the truth.

By the time we get to written records, the picture does look surprisingly modern, right down to the gumbling. History's first anti-tax movement is recorded in the city-state of Lagash around 2350 BC. This includes a listing of some of the many taxes that got reworked after a reformer overthrew the existing government:


> 
1. Since time immemorial, since life began, in those days, the head boatman appropriated boats, the livestock official appropriated asses, the livestock official appropriated sheep, and the fisheries inspector appropriated.... The shepherds of wool sheep paid a duty in silver on account of white sheep, and the surveyor, chief lamentation-singer, supervisor, brewer and foremen paid a duty in silver on account of young lambs. . . These were the conventions of former times!
2. When Ningirsu, warrior of Enlil, granted the kingship of Lagash to Urukagina, selecting him from among the myriad people, he replaced the customs of former times, carrying out the command that Ningirsu, his master, had given him.
3. He removed the head boatman from control over the boats, he removed the livestock official from control over asses and sheep, he removed the fisheries inspector from control....
4. He removed the silo supervisor from control over the grain taxes of the _guda_ -priests, he removed the bureaucrat responsible for the paying of duties in silver on account of white sheep and young lambs, and he removed the bureaucrat responsible for the delivery of duties by the temple administrators to the palace.
5. The... administrators no longer plunder the orchards of the poor. When a high quality ass is born to a _shublugal_ , and his foreman says to him, "I want to buy it from you"; whether he lets him buy it from him and says to him "Pay me the price I want!," or whether he does not let him buy it from him, the foreman must not strike at him in anger.
6. When the house of an aristocrat adjoins the house of a _shublugal_ , and the aristocrat says to him, "I want to buy it from you"; whether he lets him buy it from him, having said to him, "Pay me the price I want! My house is a large containerâ€”fill it with barley for me!," or whether he does not let him buy it from him, that aristocrat must not strike at him in anger.
7. He cleared and cancelled obligations for those indentured families, citizens of Lagash living as debtors because of grain taxes, barley payments, theft or murder.
8. Urukagina solemnly promised Ningirsu that he would never subjugate the waif and the widow to the powerful.



Interestingly Urukagina seems to have managed to cut taxes and increase social spending (another text talks about bread allowances for blind people and widows).

The connection between tax reform and social welfare might look odd according to modern political standards, but in almost all ancient societies, the administration of taxes was the prerogative of the tiny minority of literate people (and the armed power that backed them up). Lack of transparency -- and of course, lack of representative government for the vast majority -- created great opportunities for graft and exploitation of the illiterate masses. This explains another Sumerian proverb:
_"You can have a lord, You can have a king, But the man to fear is the tax collector"_ 

This doesn't mean the taxes weren't useful. Mesopotamian agriculture depended in large part on big irrigation projects too vast for individual farmers, and defense was a perennial problem. But people seem to have had the habit of wanting stuff from government and not paying for it at least 4,000 years.
