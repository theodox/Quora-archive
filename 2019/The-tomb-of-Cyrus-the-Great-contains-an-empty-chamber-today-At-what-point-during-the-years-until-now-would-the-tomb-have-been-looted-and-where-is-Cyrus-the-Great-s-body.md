The tomb was looted sometime between 330 and 324 BC, according to Alexander’s companion [Aristobulus of Cassandreia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristobulus_of_Cassandreia) who saw it intact — and then saw it after it was looted some years later.

After Alexander defeated the main Persian armies and captured Persepolis, he visited the tomb. He generally liked to portray himself as the successor of the Persian kings, and so was usually careful to respect the dignity of the Persian royal tradition. He left the tomb in the care of the [Magians ](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/magians/)who were its traditional guardians

When Alexander returned from his campaigns in India about five years later, the tomb had been looted. Nobody was able to find a culprit.

> [6.29.4] [A](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/aristobulus/)ristobulus relates that Alexander found the tomb of Cyrus, son of Cambyses, broken into and robbed, and that this act of profanation caused him much distress. The tomb was in the royal park at Pasargadae; a grove of various sorts of trees had been planted round it; there were streams of running water and a meadow with lush grass.

> [6.29.5] The base of the monument was rectangular, built of stone slabs cut square, and on top was a roofed chamber, also built of stone, with access through a door so narrow that only one man at a time - and a little one at that - could manage, with great difficulty, painfully to squeeze himself through. Inside the chamber there was a golden coffin containing Cyrus' body, and a great divan with feet of hammered gold, spread with covers of some thick, brightly colored material, with a Babylonian rug on top.

> [6.29.6] Tunics and a _candys_  - or Median jacket - of Babylonian workmanship were laid out on the divan,note and (Aristobulus says) Median trousers, various robes dyed in amethyst, purple, and many other colors, necklaces, scimitars, and inlaid earrings of gold and precious stones. A table stood by it, and in the middle of it lay the coffin which held Cyrus' body.

> [6.29.7] Within the enclosure, by the way which led up to the tomb, a small building had been constructed for the Magi who guarded it, a duty which had been handed down from father to son ever since the time of Cyrus' son, Cambyses. They had a grant from the King of a sheep a day, with an allowance of meal and wine, and one horse a month to sacrifice to Cyrus.

> [6.29.8] There was an inscription on the tomb in Persian, signifying:

> O man, I am Cyrus son of Cambyses,
who founded the empire of Persia
and ruled over Asia.
Do not grudge me my monument.

> [6.29.9] Alexander had always intended, after his conquest of Persia, to visit the tomb of Cyrus and now, when he did so, he found that all it contained except the divan and the coffin had been removed. Even the royal remains had not escaped desecration,note for the thieves had taken the lid from the coffin and thrown out the body; from the coffin itself they had chipped or broken various bits in an attempt to reduce its weight sufficiently to enable them to get it away. However, they were unsuccessful and went off without it.

> [6.29.10] Aristobulus tells us that he himself received orders from Alexander to put the monument into a state of thorough repair: he was to restore to tie coffin what was still preserved of the body and replace the lid; to put right all damage to the coffin itself, fit the divan with new strapping, and to replace with exact replicas of the originals every single object with which it had previously been adorned; and, finally, to do away with the door into the chamber by building it in with stone, covered by a coat of plaster, on which was to be set the royal seal.

> [6.29.11] Alexander had the [Magians](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/magians/) who guarded the monument arrested and put to the torture, hoping to extort from them the names of the culprits; but even under torture they were silent, neither confessing their own guilt nor accusing anybody else; so, as they could not be convicted of any sort of complicity in the crime, Alexander released them.

[Arrian, the Anabasis of Alexander](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/arrian/anabasis/alexander-and-the-tomb-of-cyrus/)

A much later Roman-era account suggests that the robbery was part of the general lawlessness which plagued the conquered Persian territories while Alexander was off campaigning in the east:

> [Aristobulus says] that on a later visit the place had been robbed and everything had been carried off except the couch and the coffin, which had only been broken to pieces, and that the robbers had removed the corpse to another place, a fact which plainly proved that it was an act of plunderers, not of the satrap, since they left behind only what could not easily be carried off; and that the robbery took place even though the tomb was surrounded by a guard of Magi, who received for their maintenance a sheep every day and a horse every month. But just as the remoteness of the countries to which Alexander's army advanced, Bactra and India, had led to numerous other revolutionary acts, so too this was one of the revolutionary acts.

[Strabo, 15.3.7](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/15C*.html)

Of course, given the behavior of many of Alexander’s generals during the civil wars which were about to break out it’s most likely that one of them was the real author of the deed — Alexander’s respect for Persian tradition and what he regarded as his royal kin was rather prim and old-fashioned in the free-booting world of Macedonian adventurers. On the other hand tomb-robbing in Egypt was traditionally a specialty among the artisans and workers who built the tombs (the tomb was on the grounds of a royal palace, which will have had a large staff) so it’s possible that it was local people who helped themselves during an unsettled period. Lastly, the theft of the body might point at a Persian resistance movement, who may have take it to act as a kind of rallying point or symbol.

However all of this is speculation — Alexander was clearly unable to find a culprit despite a ruthless examination. It’s unlikely we’ll ever know for certain what became of Cyrus.

_We believe this is the tomb based on its location and the surviving Greek descriptions. However the epitaph which is reported in the Greek texts has not survived so we cannot be sure. The architecture of the building — with a mix of Lydian and Ionian influences — does seem to date from the early Persian empire.
