In the West, at least, if you had to pick one individual you should go with [Honorius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorius_(emperor)) instead, a petty loser whose only appreciable talent was for self-preservation — usually achieved by murdering or selling out talented and conscientious subordinates like [Stilicho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho).

Romulus was never an emperor in any meaningful sense; his father, [Orestes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orestes_(father_of_Romulus_Augustulus)) was actually in charge and the boy — he was only 12 — was just a way to slightly disguise the machinations of Orestes who, among other things, had worked at the court of Attila the Hun.

As for Constantine? Well, if nothing else his choice for the new capital lasted for more than 1,000 years. The Roman Empire didn’t really fall until 1453. There’s a reason it was called _Constantinople_  before it was Istanbul.
