# Besides the years proceeding the Persian Wars in 479 BC and preceding the Peloponnesian War, was Athens ever in control of Hellas, more than Sparta?

Athens rebounded to a powerful, but not dominant position more than once after the Peloponessian war. The 'natural' state of affairs in Greece was for everyone to gang up on the leader, so the periods when Athens and Sparta were dominant were both short and unusual (see [How did the Spartan empire fall?](https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Spartan-empire-fall)) Thebes also had a brief spell as the hegemonic power, but again the pile-on-the-leader problem meant this did not last long ([more in this question](https://www.quora.com/Between-431-and-362-B-C-Athens-Sparta-and-Thebes-each-tried-to-impose-hegemony-over-the-city-states-of-Greece-but-none-succeeded-except-for-a-short-period-of-time-Why-did-each-state-fail-What-are-the-components-of-successful-rule)).

Athens remained wealthy and powerful (by local standards) down to the final Roman annexation of Greece in 146 BC. Her most significant political achievement was organizing opposition to Phillip of Macedon both politically and militarily. However the Athenian-led forces were defeated at [Chaeronea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaeronea) in 338, which marked the end of Athenian status as a 'great power' - after that the main actors would be Hellenistic kingdoms or Greek federations like the [Aetolian League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetolian_League) and the [Achaean League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaean_League): the day of city-states was over.
