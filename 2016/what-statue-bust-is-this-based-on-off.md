My first instinct is to say it’s a modern person’s idea of a classical bust, not really copying anything very old.

The first thing that makes me suspicious is the proportions. The depth from the base to the chin is very shallow. In most Roman busts with shoulders, the chin is well above the halfway mark from the base to the crown of the head: here it seems to almost right at 50%:

The rigid alignment between the head and shoulders also seems off— most full-bust ancient portraits are deliberately off-axis to add some expression and asymmetry:

The column capital does not look very authentic either: capitals are almost always symmetrical around columns in all directions whereas this one is easily twice as wide and not as deep as the column it sits on. Moreover the column is just grooved: the usual style for these would be to have scalloped beginnings and endings to the fluting along the sides.

Lastly the way the cape is rendered is also suspicious: In real Roman stuff it’s almost always pinning a military cloak with a hood, and you can usually spot the extra folds over the left shoulder making it a bit baggy under the chin.

This figure on the other hand has a very symmetrical abstracted cloak, more like a fantasy robe than the somewhat boxy military gear you see in classical statues.

So… I don’t think it’s very closely based off a Roman or Greek original (the heavy cloak would not be very Greek in any case)
