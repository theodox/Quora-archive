A good place to start for ancient warfare illustrations are books from Osprey Publishing, which caters to military history buffs with an academic bent. You might want to start with [The Army of Alexander the Great](https://amzn.to/2RiQIQj) or [Macedonian Warrior](https://amzn.to/3898tbM). Osprey also has several related titles covering contemporary Greek and Persian armies too.
