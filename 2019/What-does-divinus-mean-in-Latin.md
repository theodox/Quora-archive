It’s the adjective for “divine” or “god-like” or “belonging to a god.” Like most Latin adjectives you can also use it as a substantive (ie, as if it were a noun) — in which case it becomes something like “the supernatural.”

The full range of uses is well documented [here.](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=divinus&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059)
