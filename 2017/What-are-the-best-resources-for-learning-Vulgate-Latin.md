[The Mere Bones of Latin ](http://amzn.to/2yi4bh7)(aka _Ossa Latinitatis Sola_ ) is an unconventional textbook, aimed more at adults than at secondary school or college. It’s great — in more ways than one, it must weigh five pounds! But that’s mostly because its full of example texts that are not the usual recycled bits of Ovid, Vergil and Caesar — part of the theme of the book is to look at the whole long stretch of Latinity with medieval and renaissance sources given more prominence. Jerome gets a few shout-outs (and a couple of scoldings).

Evan Der Milner’s [Latinum Latin Language Audio Course](https://www.patreon.com/latinum/posts) also brings in a lot of post-classical Latin sources, including the Vulgate bible, the Latin mass, and medieval and renaissance authors.
