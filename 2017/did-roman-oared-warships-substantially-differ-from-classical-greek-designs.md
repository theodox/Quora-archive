From _classical_  Greek designs, yes. The ships that fought the Persians at Salamis or carried Alexander’s men across to Asia Minor were on the whole much smaller and lighter than the ships which fought the Carthaginians or at Actium. After about the first century, the Roman navy tended to atrophy since there was basically no one to fight; however there was a lot of evolution in the civilian world that gradually made its way into military use as well.

The Romans didn’t really innovate in naval architecture; the basically extended and exaggerated the trends that were present in the Hellenistic navies. The classical trireme was built almost like a racing shell: long and slender and light (among other things, they were designed to be beached at night — the crew had to be able to haul it them onto a beach). After Alexander’s time, the growing popularity of catapults lead to heavier, beamier ships which had the structural strength to handle the increased weight and tophamper of the weapons and provided a stabler firing platforms.

An Athenian trireme of the Peloponessian war period was about 35 meters long and about 3.5 meters wide, a slender aspect ratio of about 10:1. Estimates for the displacement vary from a low of about 35 metric tons to a high of around 100, though the usual figure given is around 70. Crews seem to have been was something like 150 sailors and 40 marines.

The Hellenistic navies favored much larger ships; quadriremes (with four banks or rowers to the trireme’s 3), quinquiremes (with 5 banks) and even hexaremes (with six) , all the way up to octoremes (8) and decaremes (10); There was even an infamous [Tessarakonteres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessarakonteres), a monstrous “forty” bank ship with a crew of 4,000. That was a white elephant prestige project, rather than a serious piece of military engineering — but it illustrates [the trend of the times](http://www.hellenicaworld.com/Greece/Technology/en/GiantShips.html). A monster which actually fought, however, was the [Leontophoros —](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leontophoros) an “eight” with 1600 oarsmen and 1,200 marines.

The size race seems to have had a as much to do with prestige and bragging rights as with practicalities (not unlike [the elephant arms race](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-historical-fact-you-know-off-the-top-of-your-head/answer/Steve-Theodore), which went on at the same time) , because it settled down by the mid 3rd century. The main battle ship classes after that point were the more practical quadriremes and quinquiremes, which were still notably bigger than classical triremes. A quinquireme carried about twice as many rowers and twice as many marines as a trireme, and the displacement was correspondingly greater. A quinquireme was in the ballpark of 45 x 5 meters, an aspect of 9:1, although they usually sported more pronounced outriggers which gave them more deck space.

_Relative (estimated) ship sizes. Check the dashed lines under the hulls for displacement and crew counts. This uses the Greek names_ tetreres_,_ penteres _and_ hexares _for_ quadrireme_,_ quinquereme_, and_ hexareme_._ 

The Punic Wars between Carthage and Rome were fought primarily with quadriremes and quinquiremes, though larger ships were also involved. Polybius, writing after the Second Punic War, said

> If we take into consideration the superior size of the quinqueremes, compared with the triremes employed by the Persians against the Greeks, and again by the Athenians and Lacedaemonians in their wars with each other, we shall find that never in the whole history of the world have such enormous forces contended for mastery at sea.

The tactics changed too. As ships got heavier, the classical era ram declined in importance: these bigger ships were designed to soften up enemies with missile fire and then to grapple, not for the delicate fencing maneuvers of [Phormio ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phormio). The Carthaginians — better sailors, in general, than the Romans — retained more of the old style but even they built bigger and heavier than the earlier eras and their ships were according less maneouverable. The classic Roman shipborne weapon wasn’t the ram — it was the [corvus](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/corvus/), a crane with a spiked 8-meter boarding ramp which was dropped onto enemy decks to provide both an inescapable grapple and an easy entry for the Roman boarders. Naturally, this kind of arrangement was topheavy and required a broader, heavier ship than the trim triremes of three centuries before.

Smaller ships — usually known as [Liburnians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liburna) — were always in use as courier and patrol vessels. Lumbering quinqueremes were useless against pirates or for scouting, so these smaller vessels were always common. A Liburnian was about the size of a classical era _pentekonter_ , a 50-oared, single decked galley.

[Actium ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium)(in 31 BC) was the last important fleet action for almost 500 years — the next big battle was the [Battle of Cap Bon ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cap_Bon_(468))in 468. With peace on the seas, naval architecture didn’t advance much in the intervening years. At some point between the first and eighth centuries the lateen sail began to appear on civilian shipping, which made a big improvement to windward sailing. However it’s not clear how widespread this was before the Arab-Byzantine conflicts, and adoption seems to have been spotty. Over the same long interval, ship construction shifted to the skeletal system in which hulls were built up over a timber frame — before that ships were built “shell in”, which made them lighter and more flexible but prone to catastrophic failures. The adoption of skeletal construction accelerated the decline of the ram, since tougher ships tended to lock together rendering ramming as dangerous to the attacker as the defender.

The ultimate product of Greco-Roman shipbuilding is the Byzantine [Dromon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromon), which emerged at some point around the sixth century. This was a smaller, faster and handier ship — owing more to the Liburnian than to the big battleships — with a only one or two banks of oars and lateen sails.

_A Byzantine Dromon. While similar in size to a classical ship it has a deeper draught and three masts. The “ram” bow is not really for ramming, being wood rather than bronze or iron._
