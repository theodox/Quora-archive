Yes. “Byzantine” was [coined in the sixteenth century](http://www.hellenicaworld.com/Byzantium/History/en/ByzantineEmpire.html) (by German legal scholar Hieronymus Wolf) to distinguish between the western empire, whose legal code he used as the basis of his work, and the eastern which he wanted to treat separately. It was originally a more-or-less neutral term to distinguish neatly between the Greek-language heritage of the east and the Latin-language heritage of the west, but almost from the start it developed [negative connotations](https://www.quora.com/Was-the-Byzantine-Empire-actually-byzantine-If-so-how). Nowadays most English-speaking scholars use “East Roman” as a more neutral term.

In older contexts (typically before the year 330) “Byzantium” [can also refer to the old Greek city of Byzantion](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Byzantium-and-the-Byzantine-Empire), which was absorbed into Constantinople.
