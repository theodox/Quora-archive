Zenobia (~240 - 275) was the queen of [Palmyra](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-significance-of-the-city-of-Palmyra-in-history), a rich trading city in the Syrian desert. It was also a [key strategic location](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Romans-attack-Palmyra) on the Roman/Parthian frontier as well. She’s a famous warrior queen who briefly challenged Roman power in the Near East and became a popular figure of romantic legend.

__Prelude__

_Shapur takes Valerian into custody, 260_ 

In 260, emperor Valerian was captured by the Parthians, triggering a series of crises all over the Roman world. The Palmyrene king [Odaenathus ](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/odaenathus/)— Zenobia’s husband — organized the defense of the Roman east more or less on his own initiative, fighting off the Parthians and supporting Valerian’s son [Gallienus](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/gallienus/) against rival claimants to the imperial throne. Gallienus was in a very weak position: in the wake of Valerian’s death Gaul and Britain had become [effectively independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Empire) and Gallienus was highly dependent on Odaenathus and Zenobia to stave of the Parthians and to put down rival Roman generals.

As a result, Gallienus had to look aside as Palmyra became more and more powerful. Nominally Palmyra was playing the part of a loyal Roman ally, but in practice the kingdom was pursuing a more and more independent course. In his native Aramaic Odenaethus started styling himself _mlk mlk’_ or “King of Kings” — the same title as the Parthian emperor used. He was however more discrete in his Latin inscriptions where he remained a regular _rex._ 

__Zenobia takes charge__ 

In 267 Odenaethus was assassinated. In the turmoil that followed his widow seized power. She claimed to act as regent for her young son, but in fact she was the sole ruler of the fledgling Palmyrene empire.

She was a remarkable woman, famous for her beauty, her culture, and her ruthlessness.

She claimed (on what seem to be dubious grounds) to be a descendant of Cleopatra, of Dido, the foundress of Carthage, and more plausibly of [Julia Domna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Domna) the redoubtable matriarch of the Severan dynasty in Rome. We’re not sure who her ancestors really were but she’s probably a member of the mixed Arab-Syrian aristocracy of Palmyra (here family were of course also Roman citizens; her Roman name was Julia Aurelia Zenobia). “Zenobia” is a Greek name; her given name in Aramaic was Bat-Zabbai.__ As an aristocrat, she was well educated — she evidently spoke Greek, Latin, and Coptic in addition to her native Aramaic. Her court included both local intellectuals and Greek philosophers — including [Cassius Longinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassius_Longinus_(philosopher)), who is sometimes credited with convincing her to finally break with Rome.

Court life, however, is not what she is famous for. A later Arabic tradition claimed she ran her families flocks as a young woman, learning to live in the saddle and also acquiring the habit of command. She was reputed to keep up with the hardest-riding cavalry and to follow her armies on campaign through any hardship. In any event she had a lot of riding to do: shortly after assuming power she began seizing Roman territory, leading her armies in person into Asia Minor, the Levant, and finally, fatally into Egypt.

__A step to far__ 

In the chaotic world of late 3rd century Roman politics, even a little local empire building might be tolerated: other important Roman magnates had fought each other with depressing regularity and been brought back into the fold with titles and ex-post-facto recognition. Even while her armies were seizing Antioch and Jerusalem she continued to issue coins with Roman emperor’s profile on the obverse:

_A coin of Vabalathus (Zenobia’s son and nominal co-ruler). Vabalathus on the face but emperor Aurelian on the obverse. Not that Vabalathus is in a toga and wears a laurel fillet._ 

However Zenobia’s ambitions led her to make an irrevocable break with Rome: in 269 she invaded Egypt.

_A more honest coin: ZENOBIA AUGUSTA (ie, “empress”) and on the reverse IUNO REGINA, “Queen Juno” — A Latin name, but the goddess is the Palmyrene version of Astarte._ 

Unfortunately for her, Rome had finally found a capable emperor after a decade of chaos: [Aurelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian) assumed the throne in 270 and quickly began to weld the shattered empire back together. He quickly re-absorbed Gaul and Britain and swatted down two major barbarian invasions, earning his title _Restitutor Orbis,_ “Restorer of the World”

He might have been willing to cut a deal with Zenobia if she were merely another regional power-broker, but Egypt provided the irreplaceable grain shipments which kept the city of Rome from starvation: no Roman emperor could allow it to remain out of his direct control for long. In 272 Aurelian’s army marched on Palmyra and broke Zenobia’s forces; her short-lived empire collapsed in a single quick campaign.

The sources don’t agree on what happened next. In the more popular and romantic version of the story, Aurelian brought Zenobia in triumph to Rome. When some Romans were scandalized that an emperor would deign to lord it over a woman, Aurelian defended himself thus:

> "I have heard,Conscript Fathers, that men are reproaching me for having performed an unmanly deed in leading Zenobia in triumph. But in truth those very persons who find fault with me now would accord me praise in abundance, did they but know what manner of woman she is, how wise in counsels, how steadfast in plans, how firm toward the soldiers, how generous when necessity calls, and how stern when discipline demands. I might even say that it was her doing that Odaenathus defeated the Persians and, after putting Sapor to flight, advanced all the way to Ctesiphon. I might add thereto that such was the fear that this woman inspired in the peoples of the East and also the Egyptians that neither Arabs nor Saracens nor Armenians ever moved against her. Nor would I have spared her life, had I not known that she did a great service to the Roman state when she preserved the imperial power in the East for herself, or for her children. Therefore let those whom nothing pleases keep the venom of their own tongues to themselves.

Afterward she was allowed to retire into comfortable exile in Rome (in some tellings, Aurelian married one of her daughters, though that seems a detail too novelistic to be true). There is however an alternate version in which she killed herself rather an allowing herself to be dragged to Rome in chains, and a later Arab tradition says she was killed trying to escape the vengeance of a bedouin chieftain.

As for the city itself, Aurelian originally spared it but it rose up in rebellion a year later and was brutally sacked. It never regained its famous wealth and importance, and until last year it was primarily a picturesque ruin until the modern-day barbarians of ISIS [attempted to destroy the city](http://www.reuters.com/news/picture/palmyra-before-and-after-isis?articleId=USRTSCQPG) and[ callously murdered its chief archeologist.](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/aug/20/militants-behead-mr-palmyra/)

It’s not entirely clear what Zenobia was really up to. Some have seen her as the leader of an independence movement, others think she aspired to rule the entire Roman empire (she apparently obliged her sons to speak Latin in preference to Aramaic, and dressed the whole family in imperial purple). She has however always enjoyed a reputation as a daring and formidable woman, and has been a favorite subject of artists and writers for the last seventeen centuries

> When Aurelian had taken her prisoner, he caused her to be led into his presence and then addressed her thus: "Why is it, Zenobia, that you dared to show insolence to the emperors of Rome?" To this she replied, it is said: "You, I know, are an emperor indeed, for you win victories, but Gallienus and Aureolus and the others I never regarded as emperors. Believing _Victoria [the Roman goddess of Victory]_  to be a woman like me, I desired to become a partner in the royal power, should the supply of lands permit."
