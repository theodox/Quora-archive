Although [Al Stewart](https://alstewart.com/) is mostly famous for late-hippie classic _The Year of the Cat_ , he’s always been a history buff and his [back catalog](https://alstewart.com/music) — which is pretty long these days — includes a ton of historical material, often very obscure.



__Roads to Moscow__  covers the entire Eastern Front, from 1941 to 1945



__The Palace of Versaille__  covers the French Revolution

But that’s pretty 101 level stuff. Among some of his more esoteric ones:



__Warren Gamaliel Harding__ , a surprisingly boppy tune about the years between the wars and the dubious president.



__Hanno the Navigator__  follows a Phoenician expedition around the coast of Africa from Morocco to Cameroon



__Old Admirals__ , about the end of the British sailing navy and its replacement by steam.



__Joe The Georgian__ , a balalaika tune about how Bolshevism became Stalinism



__The Coldest Winter in Memory__ covers the Great Northern War between Sweden and Russia in 1709. I did say “obscure.”



__Shah of Shahs__  covers the Iranian Revolution



__Peter on the White Sea__  covers the Russian Czar’s travels in the west.

_This isn’t a complete list by any means._
