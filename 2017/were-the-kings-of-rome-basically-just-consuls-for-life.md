The pre-republican kings of Rome were kings in the usual sense for the time. That’s not exactly the same as your average medieval king (among other things, they were “elected” by the citizen assembly — that is, by the city militia — rather than inheriting the throne. However they played the same priest-king / warlord role that you might see in the _Iliad._ They had some ritual functions in the Roman religion, they led armies in wartime, and functioned as lawgivers. They ruled for life but didn’t automatically pass on their role to their sons.

Looking back at the period later, the Romans saw it through the lens of Greek political theory and drew a distinction between “legitimate” kings like [Numa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numa_Pompilius) or [Servius Tullius](http://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/servius-tullius-last-benevolent-king-rome-002849) on the one hand and “tyrants” like [Lucius Tarquinius Superbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus). Essentially a “tyrant” ruled in defiance of (vaguely defined) customary law using military power to bolster his reign, where a “king” respected traditional rights and ruled more or less by the consent of the citizen body.

The consulate was created [after the revolution that created the Republic](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/junius-brutus-lucius/) with the express purpose of preventing future tyrants from arising in Rome. The two consuls were there to keep an eye on each other, so no individual could monopolize the executive power. The annual rotation of office (and a customary, though not legal, taboo about the same person holding office too soon after their last term) made sure that the executive was not a threat. Some of the king’s powers — particularly the power to accept or expel members of the citizen body — was given to the [censors ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_censor)as a further way of keeping the consuls humble.

For many centuries, institution of monarchy was seen as extremely ‘un-Roman’ — so much so that sole rulers like Marius, Sulla and above all Caesar and his imperial successors pretended not to be “kings” even though they had full monarchical powers. The only allowable use for _rex_ , “king,” was for a priestly office which inherited some of the special religious duties of the old monarchy. The title didn’t really re-enter official Roman usage until the eastern empire switched to Greek and used _Basileus_  — the ancient Greek word for “king” — to describe emperors.
