There are a wide variety of cosmologies out there, they don't all resemble each other very closely. Some are highly anthropomorphic, with human like creators or gods who behave like humans; others are highly abstract, such as Hesiod's Gaia emerging from Chaos. Some groups didn't see a 'creation' at all, but regarded history as an eternal cycle with no beginning and no end. 

There may be some similarities across broad groups: the "order from chaos" story in Hesiod has parallels in other Indo-European cultures from Norse to Hindu, but all of these shared a common linguistic ancestry so the similarity is not surprising -- and of course the details vary a great deal. 

The [Creation myth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth) wiki page identifies five or six broad types, but within those there is a lot of diversity.
