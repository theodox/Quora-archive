I haven’t heard that exact term before - but it’s almost certainly referring to a ‘demo reel’ — that is to say the samples of you past work that you provide to possible employers when you are job hunting.

The term goes back to the days of film production in movies, when you actually brought a reel of film to a job interview. Nowadays you are almost certainly providing a link to your website, or maybe a thumbdrive full of movie files, but the idea is the same.

So — assuming I’m right about the term! — there’s nothing special about “reel work” — it’s simply samples of your work that you’re using to find an job or a new client. As such you should pick and choose your best work very carefully: it’s very common for beginners to feel like they have to pad out their portfolio with extra stuff so it looks more complete. Don’t! The first thing that a screener or potential client will notice is the quality of the work and not the volume!

Here’s a couple of examples of how people in the business talk about reels:

As you’ll see the basics are always the same: have good stuff, showcase it well, call out any work that is not your own, and don’t overdo it on the extraneous production values.

Also: do take the time to make sure your videos play well; if your beautiful work is streaming from an overloaded mac mini in your basement, people will just move on to the next candidate.
