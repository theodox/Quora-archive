The odds definitely favor the Zulus — particularly since the a Roman legion fielded only about 5000 men (the number varied over time, but that’s a reasonable ballpark). At[ Isandlwana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Isandlwana) the Zulu army was about 20,000 and that was not the entire strength of the zulus nation.

Man for man the Romans would have an advantage due to their armor — unless of course it was a very hot battlefield. A Roman legion also had significant artillery support in the form of stone and bolt throwers. At even numbers the Romans would therefore have the edge— but the question proposes wildly uneven numbers.

On the other hand the Zulu would have a significant advantage in mobility — Roman legionaries could not match the astonishing mobility of the Zulu impis; that between their armor and their various equipment they’d be lucky to make twenty miles a day, rather than forty or fifty.

If nothing else, the discipline and tactics of the Zulus would probably earn the same grudging praise from the Romans that the Romans themselves got from Pyrrhus of Epirus : “these barbarians certainly don’t carry themselves barbarously.”
