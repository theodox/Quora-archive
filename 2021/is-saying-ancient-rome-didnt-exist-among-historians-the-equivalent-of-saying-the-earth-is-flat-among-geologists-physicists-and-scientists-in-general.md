# Is saying Ancient Rome didn't exist among historians the equivalent of saying the Earth is flat among geologists, physicists, and scientists, in general?

Pretty much, yes.

I wouldn’t limit it to just historians. I’ve gradually, and somewhat reluctantly, come around to the theory that crankery of these sorts is not really about subject matter at all — you pretty much can not reach these kinds of conclusions through the standard practices of deductive reasoning. This stuff _looks like_  argument, but only superficially. It bears about the same relationship to the pursuit of truth that a shambling zombie does to human being.

Or, to borrow from wiser heads than mine, _not everything pretends to be an argument really is one:_ 



The reason I would not limit the discussion to professionals is that cranks of all kinds _don’t really care about their subject matter at all._ 

They may appear to be obsessively concerned with it but if you end up tangling with them — not a pastime I’d recommend! — you will generally find that their knowledge of their own hobby-horse is often shockingly limited: there’s a robotic repetitiveness to the worst of these cases that’s usually incredibly _boring._ People who nerd out on a given subject tend to groove on the details even when they can’t agree on how the picture fits together: whether it’s two academics having a long footnote war over a disputed passage in Josephus or two comic fans having a knock-down-drag-out over the relative strength of Thor and the Hulk , the natural dynamic of a true subject-matter-lover’s argument is to pull in more and more detail.

But the crank simply repeats himself. Any data which doesn’t serve to vindicate that one central piece of gimcrackery might as well not exist. Having discovered a vast trans-temporal conspiracy to fabricate an entire civilization spanning a million and a half square miles., the crank seems oddly incurious as to why, for example, these faux-Romans would have such a ruinous fixation on expensive spices or why the conspiracy would go to such lengths to invent such an elaborate vocabulary for oral sex. Surely, the conspiracy needs to be appreciated as a vast and audacious work of art!

But no — “winning” is the only thing the crank cares about. With ten million factoids to choose from, it’s only the five or six that can be tortured into fitting into the preferred outcome that matter. The rest of it might as well not exist.

There’s a lot of theories about the psychology of crankery. Is it mere trolling? Is it a mild form of mental illness? Is it an expression of social dislocation? I dunno. But what I do know is that it seems weirdly _joyless._ Cranks may think they are are in battle with the professionals — they think that doing something for a living means you’re in on the con. However their true opposites are the amateurs: the people who love a given subject without making a living from it. Amateur, after all, means _lover._ 

But haters gonna hate. Might as well get used to it, it’s not going anywhere.
