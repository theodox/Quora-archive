Carthage is the original Phoenician colony city in modern Tunisia. [Carthago Nova](http://www.ancient.eu/Carthago_Nova/) is what the Romans called the Carthagjnian colony in Spain that is now modern Cartagena.

It's slightly confusing because the Carthaginians were not given to poetic names — both cities were called [Qart Hadasht](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qart_Hadasht) or “New city” in Punic. In Latin though the usage was more consistent.
