They were bit-players. It became obvious fairly quickly that the city-state was no longer the fundamental unit of power in the Greek world. During the first set of civil wars, the various successors tried a variety of tricks to gain support in Greece; sometimes this took the form of supporting local proxies, sometimes the imposition of Macedonian garrisons, and sometimes of “liberating” the various cities from proxy rulers or garrisons established by a rival successor.

The dream of independence died hard, but the reality was the the vast resources of the big successor states dwarfed those of individual cities. As time went on the creation of federal states like [Achaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaean_League) and [Aitolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetolian_League) helped to preserve some degree of Greek liberty — but traditional Greek leaders like Athens, Sparta, and Thebes tended to be more interested in the hopeless pursuit of former glory than in cooperative defense. The one city-state which really survived and prospered as an independent polity in the Hellenistic age was [Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes), which managed to retained its independence down to the Roman period.

The relationship between the city-states and the successor kingdoms resembled the relationships between third-world nations and the Cold War superpowers: it wasn’t a match of equals in any sense. Lip-service appeals to “freedom of the Greeks” were a hallmark of Hellenistic diplomacy — but in practice, the big Hellenistic kingdoms were always willing to use the traditional city-states as tools. For their parts different cities found ways to play the big powers off against each other. The result was a long period of continuous low-grade conflict which did not seriously alter the balance of power and in which local autonomy was repeatedly crushed by larger forces.

__Athens__  attempted to regain its freedom of action after Alexander’s death. The [Lamian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamian_War) of 323 was (depending on how you look at it) a brave or foolhardy effort to reassert the traditional freedoms of the Greeks against Macedonian hegemony, represented by Alexander’s viceroy [Antipater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipater). Despite some early successes, however, the effort collapsed — the anti-Macedonian coalition was to sluggish and too fragile, and the arrival of powerful Macedonian reinforcements from the east doomed the whole affair.

In the immediate aftermath of the war, the Athenian statesman [Phocion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocion#Confrontation_with_Macedonia) used his personal relationship with Antipater to soften the terms of the capitulation, but they were still very harsh: more than 12,000 citizens were exiled, Athens was given a Macedonian garrison, and prominent anti-Macedonian leaders like Demosthenes were executed. Phocion ended up as a kind of Athenian Petain — the local face of an unpopular foreign occupation.

Antipater died in 319, and the Macedonian forces split between the legitimists (supporters of [Polyperchon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyperchon), who was regent for Alexander’s son) and Cassander, Antipater’s estranged son. The struggle soon escalated into open warfare, with both sides seeking support from different factions in Greece; Cassander tended to side with populist factions, and Polyperchon with aristocrats, though both sides were not particularly picky in their search for supporters. When Cassander eventually triumphed, he installed friendly regimes everywhere in Greece — in Athens, he installed [Demetrius of Phalerum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_of_Phalerum) who ruled the city until 307. Demetrius was driven out by [Demetrius Poliorcetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_I_of_Macedon), the son of Cassander’s rival successor-king Antgonus — the aftermath of this “liberation” set the pattern for many successive events in Greece, with Athenians falling over themselves to pay honor to their liberator (Demetrius was installed in the Parthenon, and offered sacrifices alongside Athena) while quickly realizing that they had just exchanged one master for another.

__Boeotia__  was effectively irrelevant, because [Alexander had destroyed Thebes in 336](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/diodorus/the-sack-of-thebes/), removing the most powerful Boeotian state. The city was restored by [Cassander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassander) in starting in 315 — his one and only good deed — but the conditions of its restoration made it a Macedonian satellite rather than a fully independent state for some generations.

Eventually the Thebans had enough local autonomy to try shopping around for allies; at various times they worked with the Aitolians, the Achaeans and the Macedonians, finally settling into a long-term alliance with the Macedonians in the 236. As a key part of the Macedonian system the Thebans suffered heavily during the Roman-Macedonian conflicts and the city was occupied by the Romans in 197.

__Sparta__  had stayed aloof from Alexander’s adventures — even while Alexander was fighting in the Near East, the[ Spartans had taken Persian money to attack the Macedonians in Greece](https://www.quora.com/Would-Alexander-the-Great-have-conquered-Sparta-if-he-invaded-it). However they were [summarily defeated by Antipater in 331](https://www.quora.com/Neither-Philip-II-nor-his-son-Alexander-the-Great-attempted-to-conquer-Sparta-itself-Why); Alexander’s decision to spare their city was greeted with great surprise by the rest of Greece.

Sparta was seriously hobbled in the post-war settlement, with territory parcelled out to traditional rivals which kept the Spartans engaged in low-grade local conflicts from then on. The Macedonians were eager to stir the pot, and the Spartans would end up persistently opposed to the Achaean League, their Peloponessian neighbors down to the Roman conquest, with Macedon playing the two sides off against each other.

Sparta’s fabled military never really recovered from the defeat at Megalopolis. The greatest Spartan victory of the Hellenistic era was [driving off Pyrrhus of Epirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sparta) in 272, an unconventional victory won mostly by women, boys and reservists in the streets of Sparta itself — but the victory would have gone for nothing if Macedonian rescuers had not arrived to chase Pyrrhus off.

The last serious threat to Macedonian hegemony in Greece was the __[Chremonidean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chremonidean_War)__  in the 260’s. This saw an alliance of Athens and Sparta sponsored by Ptolemaic Egypt. Spartan king [Areus I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areus_I) was killed on the field of Corinth, leaving the Athenians isolated in Greece, and the Ptolemaic fleet was destroyed at [Cos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cos), rendering further reinforcements impossible. Athens was permanently reduced to a Macedonian protectorate and Sparta spiraled into social conflict which would preoccupy the city for much of the next century. The Spartans would again be beaten by the Macedonians (with help from the Achaeans, illustrating the see-saw principle of Macedonian rule) at [Sellasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sellasia) in 222, leading to the first-ever foreign occupation of Sparta proper and setting the stage for the strange rule of [Nabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabis), the last Spartan king.
