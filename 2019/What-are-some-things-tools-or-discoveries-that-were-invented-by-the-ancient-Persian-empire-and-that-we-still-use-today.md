It’s important to remember that a “discovery” and a “tool” don’t have to be physical objects: a method of organization is every bit as much of a technology as something more concrete. The most important Persian contributions aren’t tools: they are organizational ideas.

The one most of us interact with on a daily basis is __regular postal service__ _._ This was a creation of Cyrus the Great, who built a vast road network and a network of relay stations to carry messages across his empire. The unofficial motto of the the US Postal Service is a straight crib from the way the Greek historian Herodotos described the Persian courier service around 500 BC.

_The Central Post Office in New York displays a famous quote from Herodotos: “Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds”._ 

The Persian postal service was not an exact predecessor of today’s: it was reserved for government use only (it would take almost 2000 more years before regular mail services were routinely available to the public). Still, this is a big Persian legacy in today’s world.

You could also make the case that the Persians invented __monetary policy.__ Like most empires in the ancient world the Persians regarded precious metals as the primary measure of value: wealth was measured by the weight of gold and silver. The Persians did use coins — but like most ancient people they regarded coins as standard units of weight, not of value. And, like most ancient kings, Persian monarchs were willing to stretch their finances by cheating a little bit on the measures, adding base metal to the coins to keep the same weight while expending less precious silver or gold. However, the Persians had a well developed system to manage the process: Persian kings explicitly controlled the metal contents of their coins and adjusted the amount of gold and silver in circulation, probably in order to favor whichever of the two metals they had on hand at any given time. Pretty much every government since has borrowed a variant on this trick to try to control their economy.
