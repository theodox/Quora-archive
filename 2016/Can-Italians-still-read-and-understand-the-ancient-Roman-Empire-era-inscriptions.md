Not really, Modern Italian is notably farther from Latin than, say, Modern Greek is from ancient Greek (see [Can modern day Greeks understand and read ancient scriptures in ancient ruins (Like this one?)](https://www.quora.com/Can-modern-day-Greeks-understand-and-read-ancient-scriptures-in-ancient-ruins-Like-this-one) for contrast. Some of the vocabulary will be similar but the grammar is quite different.

The Romans made it harder by their fondness for abbreviations and also their lack of punctuation — combined with the grammar changes this makes it a tough go if you don’t know Latin.

Most of this is either abbreviated or proper names — there’s only two spelled out nouns in the first 4 lines which aren’t names or titles. Here’s what you’d need to add to read this. memorial to Appius Claudius Caecus, who built Rome’s first aqueduct:

___APPIUS CLAUDIUS C___ _[AII, “of Caius”]_ ___F___ _[ILIUS, “the son”]_ ___CAECUS,___ __ ___Censor, cos___ _[Consul]_ ___bis___ _[twice], d_ ___ict___ _[ator],_ ___interrex___ _[in charge of calendar adjustments]_ ___III Pr___ _[aetor, an office]_ ___Aed___ _[ile, another office]_ ___Cur___ _[ulis, a version of the office of aedile]_ ___II, Q___ _[uaestor],_ ___Tr___ _[ibunus, ‘colonel’]_ ___Mil___ _[itaris, in the army]_ ___III___ 

… you get the idea. It’s pretty tough with out both the Latin background and the context — even though ‘Censor’ is the same in Italian and ‘filius’ become _figlio._
