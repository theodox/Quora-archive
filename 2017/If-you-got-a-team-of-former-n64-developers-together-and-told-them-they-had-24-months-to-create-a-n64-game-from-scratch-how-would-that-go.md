# If you got a team of former n64 developers together, and told them they had 24 months to create a n64 game from scratch, how would that go?

Besides the practical difficulties — where do you get dev kits for an N64? — you might find that it’s a serious case of _You Can’t Go Home Again._ 

If these devs have been working in games for the last 20 years, they will have gotten used to a lot of modern conveniences — everything from modern IDEs to high quality APIs for things like 3D graphics and audio. Above all, going back to N64 hardware will be pretty difficult. The N64 was rated around 94 million floating point operations per second. Which sounds pretty impressive until you compare it to a modern graphics card with might be rated at 5 _billion_ or so: an N64 can compute at about 0.2% of an GeForce Titan.

_Super Mario 64_

_Super Mario Odyssey. 20 years is a long time in games!_ 

The other thing that’s changed in 20 years is the audience. Super Mario 64 was a triumph in its day — not just technically (though it was very impressive in 1996) but also in terms of game design. SM64 was a brilliant game — many of the ways in which it defined 3d navigation and camera controls are still standards today. But many other things have changed: games tend to be a lot easier today, with more hand-holding and fewer high-failure-rate puzzles. Modern audiences are less tolerant of highly repetitive gameplay too. An authentic 1996 N64 experience will have a hard time finding an audience in 2017 — and a modern game design with 1996 technical performance might feel like it was operating in a straightjacket.

It’s not like it wouldn’t be fun for a certain kind of dev or a certain kind of player. Retro games and archaizing games like [Halo 2600 ](https://www.wired.com/2010/09/halo-2600/)have their place. But trying to bring back the glory days by just resetting the clock never works and is often more embarassing than fun _<insert appropriate political commentary / Hollywood remake / casino rock reference here>._
