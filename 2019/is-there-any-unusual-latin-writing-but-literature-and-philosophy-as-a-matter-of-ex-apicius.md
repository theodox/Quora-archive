If you mean technical or special-interest works, as opposed to the usual literature, history, and rhetoric there’s actually quite a lot — but almost by definition it tends not to be famous in the same way as literature. It’s a lot easier for an academic to write a book about complexities of rhetoric in Cicero than to argue about the correct way to plant windrows in in your farms in Columella.

Here are a few Roman authors who covered non-literary subjects. It’s a partial list covering mostly the big names — there are dozens or hundreds of lesser authors, although sadly many of them are known only in fragments or quotations :

Probably the biggest name in Roman non-fiction is Pliny, whose [Natural History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_History_(Pliny)) was a kind of Roman encyclopedia of science. It’s got a vast amount of information (some of it eminently practical, some if it a bit cockeyed) about everything from medicine to metallurgy.

[Vitruvius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius) is most famous for his work on architecture — when this book was rediscovered in the Renaissance it had a tremendous impact on architectural fashions all over Europe, but it also offers a lot of insights into the nuts and bolts of Roman civil engineering. Less well known is the engineer [Frontinus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontinus) whose work on the Roman aqueducts is key to our understanding of how these were built and operated.

[Columella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columella) wrote on agriculture, which included everything from how to manure the soil on your farm to the right way to treat your slaves. Other Roman agricultural writers included [Cato the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Elder#Writings) (who, incidentally, was apparently treated _his_  slaves quite badly if you read his book) and [Marcus Terentius Varro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Terentius_Varro) , a prolific writer who covered all sorts of non-fiction topics.

[Vegetius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Flavius_Vegetius_Renatus) wrote on military matters, not as a historian but as the author of a 3rd century training manual. Experts today differ quite a lot about whether his book is an accurate picture of the Roman military of his day or if it.

[Charisius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisius) is less famous, but his work on Latin grammar was influential both for Latin readers and for Greeks, who used it to help learn Latin.
