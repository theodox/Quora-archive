There’s no evidence to find: the “theory” in question is a crock.

Because the only way one could reach such a conclusion is by simply ignoring textual evidence that they find inconvenient (for example the Roman historian [Tacitus](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/tacitus/tacitus-on-the-jews/) and the Greek historian [Diodorus](http://attalus.org/translate/diodorus40.html), just to stick with those who were contemporary to or earlier than the revolt) we can stick with archaeological evidence. This has the nice additional property of not having to [lecture people on the way manuscript transmission in antiquity actually works](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-scholars-use-Greek-sources-like-Homer-and-Herodotus-when-studying-ancient-history-even-though-not-a-single-manuscript-has-been-found-that-was-actually-written-by-them/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=342e2b4a&srid=zLvM).

Even with that constraint, it’s _trivially_ easy to demonstrate the existence of the Jewish Revolt. The most inescapable testimony is the [Masada Ramp](https://www.ancient.eu/image/3682/the-masada-ramp/), the product of the Roman siege of Masada in 72. It’s more than a hundred meters high, and is large enough to be [easily picked out in satellite photos.](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/CORONA-KH-4B-satellite-photographs-of-Masada-Israel-313-N-353-E-acquired-by-the_fig6_233457247)

At the foot of the ramp are the remains of eight fortified Roman camps, laid out in the typical Roman rectangular grid, and the entire area is surrounded by a circumvallation. This is [the best-preserved example of a classic Roman siege](https://popular-archaeology.com/article/the-siege-of-masada/), left largely intact by the arid conditions.

There are certainly [differences in detail between the story unfolded in the archaeology and the account in Josephus](https://forward.com/news/382132/exclusive-new-archaeology-shows-refugee-camp-not-just-rebels-atop-masada/). He was not an eyewitness, and more important;y he was a Jew who had thrown in his lot with the Romans, so he typically attempts to draw a very stark distinction between “ordinary” Jews and the Zealots who animated the revolt. Archaeologists have never found evidence of the dramatic mass suicide which Josephus claims ended the siege. Josephus is far from infallible — no historical source is, and Josephus, [trapped between his Roman captors and his Jewish enemies](http://None of this means Josephus is infallible — no historical source is, and Josephus, trapped between his Roman captors and his Jewish enemies, certainly slanted his presentation. ), certainly slanted his presentation. Nevertheless, the existence of the fortress, its siege by the Romans, and the Jewish character of the defenders (whose remains [include a synagogue](http://cojs.org/the_synagogue_at_masada/)) are incontrovertible. The idea that the entire history is simply some kind of forgery is absurd.

If Masada is not enough there are also the [remains of the Roman siege of Jerusalem](https://www.livescience.com/56580-ancient-roman-battlefield-uncovered-in-jerusalem.html#:~:text=Archaeologists%20say%20they've%20found,Israel%20Antiquities%20Authority%20(IAA).). Catapult ammunition, sling stones, and spearheads mark the focus of the Roman attack on the city’s northern wall, today buried under the neighborhood known as the “Russian compound” but partially unearthed in 2016.

There’s also the very obvious problem of this:

That’s on [The Arch of Titus](https://www.ancient.eu/article/499/the-arch-of-titus-rome/), the Roman emperor who completed the defeat of the Jewish revolt and sacked Jerusalem. The arch is dated to the year 81 or 82, and has been sitting in the middle of Rome in public view ever since. To this day Orthodox Jews refuse to walk under the arch which celebrates their defeat and humiliation.

And of course, there’s also this:

The dedication of the shows up in two inscriptions: one from 71 when it was begun:

> Emperor Caesar Vespasian Augustus ordered a new amphitheatre to be made from spoils

And a second from 80, when it was completed and Titus had succeeded Vespasian

> Emperor T. Caesar Vespasian Augustus ordered a new amphitheatre to be made from spoils

We can date the inauguration of the amphitheater to the year 80/81 since it was celebrated in Titus’ coins. Where did the money come from? Well, the only spoils Titus won were from the campaign in Judea:

Vespasian, Titus and Domitian_ _[thought this victory important enough to record in 48 different coin issues over 25 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaea_Capta_coinage)_ _. Thousands of examples survive._ 

The short-lived Jewish rebel government also issued coins of its own. Typically these follow the pattern of older Jewish coins: no human or animal representation, and inscribed in Hebrew:

Some of these coins are [found in locations where refugees hid from the war](http://www.sci-news.com/archaeology/great-revolt-bronze-coins-jerusalem-05895.html)

There is of course also abundant archaeological evidence for other figures in Jewish history prior to the revolt as well. To pick an easy target, one of Josephus’ main villains in the early part of his history of the Jews is [Alexander Jannaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Jannaeus), a high priest and self-appointed king in the early first century BCE. His coins are somewhat hard to come by (his local rivals despised him, and often defaced them) but they do exist:

More, unfortunately, there’s also evidence Jannaeus’ [mass executions of political enemies.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/mass-burial-site-uncovered-in-jerusalem-evidence-of-holy-kings-bloody-reign/)

These examples were chosen mostly for accessibility: there’s an entire academic field devoted to the archaeology of ancient Israel, and it does not support anything remotely like the whole-cloth invention of Judaism or the revolt.

In general, any “history” which begins with the idea that sinister forces have conspired to deceive people is bunkum. History is if nothing else an ego-driven discipline — no story stands unchallenged for long. It’s entirely worthwhile to see if the evidence we have can be put back together in new ways — but given the contentious nature of the discipline, it’s ridiculous to assume that massive frauds have gone unchallenged for millennia. Historians argue with each other all the time: any reading that makes it into the usual textbooks has been heavily tested. [It’s always subject to further argument and revision. But it’s not just some kind of con job.](https://theeducationalblog.quora.com/The-Evaluation-of-Historical-Evidence-A-Manufactured-Roundtable-Discussion)

This “hypothesis” is another example from that sad genre.
