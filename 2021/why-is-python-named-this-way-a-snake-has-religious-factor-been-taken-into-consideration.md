# Why is Python named this way (a snake)? Has religious factor been taken into consideration?

The tagging makes the question a bit hard to parse.

Apollo, mythologically, slew is said to have slain the serpent known as Python , which etymologically relates to πυθώ, the Greek word for “decay.” Although a lot of mythology-for-kids books will tell you Apollo was a wisdom deity, or a “god of light,” many Greek authors believed [his name derived from the word for “destroy”](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CF%80%CF%8C%CE%BB%CE%BB%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B9). Apollo was strongly connected with ritual purity, hygiene, and healing; he’s a kind of divine antiseptic, and thus it makes sense for him to kill a monster embodying _decay._ You can see the opposition in the [3rd hymn to Apollo,](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0013,003:372&lang=original) where the god taunts the dying monster:

> Now rot here upon the soil that feeds man — You at least shall live no more to be a fell bane to men… Against cruel death neither Typhoeus shall avail you nor ill-famed Chimera, but here shall the Earth and shining Hyperion make you rot.



Python the programming language — the other tag in the question — is named for [Monty Python’s Flying Circus](https://pythoninstitute.org/what-is-python/). Apollo, incidentally, a famously uptight deity, was almost certainly a curly-brackets person. Python is a much more Dionysian language.
