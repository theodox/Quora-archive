If you're looking for a 'greatest hits' list:

Virgil, if your taste runs toward the epic and the formal
Horace and Ovid for lyric, particularly if you're into love (or maybe more accurately 'lust') poetry. Catullus for the same with a bit more post-modern authorial posturing.
Martial and Juvenal for social satire. 

Tibullus is an interesting contrast to the other lyric poets, not as sharp but maybe more likeable.
