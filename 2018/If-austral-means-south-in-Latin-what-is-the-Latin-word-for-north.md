The cardinal direction is [septentrio](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/septentrio). The Romans observed the rotation of the seven stars we call the Big Dipper going around the pole star and referred to them as the ‘plough of seven’ — _septem trio._ So _septentrio_  is the direction proper.

If you’re a fancy Roman the general idea of “the north” is _[Boreas](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/boreas)_ from name the Greek god of the north wind. If you’re less pretentious its _[Aquilo](http://latin-dictionary.net/definition/4355/aquilo-aquilonis)_ _,_ the Italic god who handled the same winds. Following Greek usage the ‘far north’ is _Hyperborea_ , “the country beyond the north wind.”

In modern English usage the adjectives are _boreal_  or _septentrional ._ Usually boreal implies a northern climate and septentrional implies a northerly direction.
