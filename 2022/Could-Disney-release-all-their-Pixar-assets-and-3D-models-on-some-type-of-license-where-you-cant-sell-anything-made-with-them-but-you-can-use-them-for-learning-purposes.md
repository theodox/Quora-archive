Disney already has a very comprehensive license that covers various kinds of reuse:



and the essence is “yes, you made that fan art, but really, we own it.” They tend to ignore small players who are not profiting on a commercial scale but legally they have very expansive rights over their content and they work hard to keep things that way. They live in fear of what happened to early comic characters like Betty Boop and Felix the Cat, who both lost their trademark status and became, essentially, public domain characters.



That said, Disney does in fact contribute to a industry open source technology efforts and sometimes donates assets — almost never recognizable characters! — to those projects. This year for example they donated the 3-d data set from Moana’s island to support the USD data interchange standard. You can get it here:



However it’s huge and complicated, just getting it to load is likely to be an education in itself. The same site has other open source data sets here:



Just make sure to check the included license terms.
