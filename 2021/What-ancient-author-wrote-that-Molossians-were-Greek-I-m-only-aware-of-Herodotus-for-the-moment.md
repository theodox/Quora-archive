# What ancient author wrote that Molossians were Greek? I’m only aware of Herodotus for the moment.

[Strabo](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/strabo/7g*.html) puts them among the tribes of Epirus. But he’s not using group names the way a modern nationalist does:

> And even to the present day the Thracians, Illyrians, and Epeirotes live on the flanks of the Greeks (though this was still more the case formerly than now); indeed most of the country that at the present time is indisputably Greece is held by the barbarians — Macedonia and certain parts of Thessaly by the Thracians, and the parts above Acarnania and Aetolia by the Thesproti, the Cassopaei, the Amphilochi, the Molossi, and the Athamanes — Epeirotic tribes.

Which certainly sounds non-Greek. But he he also says this

> The Amphilochians are Epeirotes; and so are the peoples who are situated above them and border on the Illyrian mountains, inhabiting a rugged country — I mean the Molossi, the Athamanes, the Aethices, the Tymphaei, the Orestae, and also the Paroraei and the Atintanes, some of them being nearer to the Macedonians and others to the Ionian Gulf […]

> In earlier times these peoples were ruled separately, each by its own dynasty. For instance, it was the descendants of Cadmus and Harmonia who ruled over the Enchelii; and the scenes of the stories told about them are still pointed out there. These people, I say, were not ruled by men of native stock; and the Lyncestae became subject to Arrabaeus, who was of the stock of the Bacchiads (Eurydice, the mother of Philip, Amyntas' son, was Arrabaeus' daughter's daughter and Sirra was his daughter); and again, of the Epeirotes, the Molossi became subject to Pyrrhus, the son of Neoptolemus the son of Achilles, and to his descendants, who were Thessalians.

Which seems to put the Molossi into an ambiguous ‘ruled-by-Greeks’ category as far back as the era of the Trojan War — and of course in historic times Molossia was the primary sponsor of the pan-Hellenic (but also popular with Thracians and Illyrians) shrine at Dodona.

This entry is rather elderly but gives a good overview of the sources. The overall conclusion could be boiled down to __“it’s complicated”__ .
