There was no permanent one. [The idea of joint rulers predates Constantine — and even Diocletian](https://www.quora.com/Who-divided-the-Roman-Empire-in-half/answer/Steve-Theodore) — but it was only after Diocletian’s creation of the formal [tetrarchy](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/tetrarchy/), with co-equal pairs or rulers and lieutenants for each half of the empire, that the need for something like a new, permanent capital in each half became apparent.

Diocletian used [Nicomedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomedia) as his eastern capital for the same reasons that Constantine would later choose Byzantium: it had excellent land and water communications with both the eastern frontier and the Danubian legions. [Sirmium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirmium) was the ‘junior’ capital for the second-ranking leader in the east.

In the west, the situation was more fluid: generally [Mediolanum (Milan) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediolanum)was the senior capital and [Augusta Treverorum (Trier)](http://www.livius.org/articles/place/augusta-treverorum-trier/) was the junior but other cities including Rome, [Arles ](http://www.livius.org/articles/place/arelate-arles/)and [Ravenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenna) were temporary capitals.
