The version typically taught in high school classes is not exactly _wrong —_ it is, however, a bit misleading.

The usual story (the one, to be clear, I’m going to say is _inadequate_ !) looks like this:

> With the breakup of the Roman empire into two parts, and the collapse of the Latin-speaking empire in the west, Europe became a politically fragmented and economically backward society. The urban culture and wealth which sustained ancient science and philosophy decayed.

> However the new Arabic empires, which came to power in large portions of the former-Roman world were wealthy and commercially well-connected; they inherited the Greek libraries of Egypt, the Levant, North Africa and Spain and were eager to translate the best of Greek thought into Arabic. It was this vibrant Arabic culture which reintroduced classical Greek works to Europe, in Arabic translation or in Arabic commentaries on ancient works.

Occasionally the above will be embroidered with some side commentary on churches not being interested in science, or Europe being mired in superstition and theocracy, etc. — the usual tedious baggage of the myth of “dark ages,” best left for another day.

The _correct_ part of the story above is that many of the key texts which drove the first big revival of European* interest in Greek texts really did arrive via Arabic intermediaries. This is most famously true with regards to the works of Aristotle: the Latin-language philosophical tradition of medieval Europe got a huge jumpstart around the end of the 11th century in large part thanks to Latin translations of the works of [Avicenna](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-sina/) and [Averroes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-rushd/). Both of those authors made extensive use of Aristotle (in translation — neither of them read the originals) so their prestige played a significant role in reviving interest in Aristotle, whose works had been mostly forgotten in the west.__†__ 

Though today they show up in histories of philosophy, in medieval Europe Avicenna, Averroes and many other Arabic writers were famous for more practical reasons: Avicenna, for example, wrote what became the [standard medical textbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canon_of_Medicine) for medieval Europe. But, thanks to the prestige of writers like Avicenna and Averroes who used and commented on older Greek works, Europe quickly developed an interest in the Greek thinkers who their Arab contemporaries found useful. [Gerard of Cremona ](https://historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=230)alone is credited with 87 books between about 1150 and 1175, mostly from Arabic language texts in the libraries of Toledo, which had been retaken from the its Muslim rulers in 1085. His work is indicative of the tenor of the times including as many Arabic works as Greek ones — both [Euclid ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid)and [Al-Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi).

Here, though, is where the traditional version of the transmission story begins to get complicated.

The new interest in Greek works also spurred _other_ channels of transmission. Jewish communities in Spain and Sicily often had their own Hebrew translations of Greek originals, for example. The Norman conquest of Sicily (in 1130) added a large number of Greek speakers to a nominally Latinate kingdom. There, translators like [Henricus Aristippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Aristippus) worked with both Arabic renderings and Greek originals.__‡__  Later the Crusades would add more sources of texts and translators— both from the libraries of the Holy Land and those of Constantinople.

So, though Arabic intermediaries played a vital role in the first wave of transmission of Greek texts to medieval Europe there were other ways for Europeans to get their hands on Greek texts. In many ways the true Arabic contribution to the process was to lend their contemporary prestige to ancient works, reviving interest in antiquity in general.

A second layer of complexity in the story, however, concerns _which_  ancient authors were to be revived. [Those Arabic scholars and their European audiences both took a fairly pragmatic approach to the Greek heritage](https://www.quora.com/Where-and-how-were-the-ancient-Greek-texts-preserved-between-the-period-of-their-writing-and-the-time-when-they-were-found-and-translated-by-the-Arabs/answer/Steve-Theodore). They focused on medicine, astronomy and mathematics — subjects which had been frequent targets for translation for a long time. It’s worth remembering that Greek science., medicine and math were also translated in the [Sassanid Persian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Gondishapur) , by the [Syriac-language Christian communities the Near East ](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/syriac-translation-of-galen), and in [Armenia](https://www.livius.org/pictures/a/other-pictures/manuscript-of-an-armenian-translation-of-euclids-elements/). The practical value of medicine, math and astronomy was obvious to many people, even those with no Greco-Roman heritage. Despite their critical historical importance the ancient philosophical ideas which became so influential in first Arabic and later Latin debates were really side-notes to the very practical, informational content that drove the book trade.

Moreover — and here’s another key correction to the usual narrative! — Greek literature and poetry were of little interest to the literary culture of the Islamic world (or, consequently, that of early medieval Europe). No one tried to translate the plays of Aeschylus, the history of Herodotus, or the poetry of Sappho from Greek into Arabic. The great [Hunayn Ibn Ishaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunayn_ibn_Ishaq), the “sheikh of the translators” did essay a translation of the _Iliad_ into Arabic_—_ but it wasn’t popular enough to survive. He was more sought-after as an ophthalmologist than an expert on Homer.

Against that rather businesslike background, Greek _literature_ — as distinct from more practical texts — would not become widely available in the west until the a second wave of translations which crested in the 16th century. Italian scholars began searching for Greek literary texts as early as the 1350’s; Petrarch [famously owned a manuscript of the Iliad, the gift of a Greek friend](https://threader.app/thread/1230924631672000513) — but he couldn’t read it: “Your Homer lies mute by my side while I am deaf by his and often I have kissed him saying: _Great man, how I wish I could hear your words!_ ” However [the fall of the Byzantine empire in 1453 brought a wave of emigres who had both the language skills and the precious original texts with them. ](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-fall-of-the-Byzantine-Empire-lead-to-the-flourishing-of-arts-politics-and-the-sciences-which-became-the-Italian-Renaissance/answer/Steve-Theodore)This second wave of Greek texts includes the works of poets, dramatists and historians. Equally important it brought direct familiarity with the Greek language into the mainstream of European scholarship: instead of trying to puzzle out a saying of Plato from the Latin version of an Arabic translation of what might have been a Syriac epitome, a European scholar of the 16th century could likely read the original.

So to sum up:

Arab influence, Arab book-collecting, and the Arab philosophical tradition all played key roles in interesting Europe in Greek works of medicine, math, and astronomy — mostly for very practical reasons. The Arab world of, say, 1000 was richer and more literate than its European counterpart. A European who wanted the best sources on medicine, astronomy, or mathematics would go to contemporary Arab authors. But those authors in turn were heavily influenced by Greek works: Arabic culture was just as deferential to ancient authority as Renaissance Europe would prove to be. That meant “modern science” in the 10th or 11th century included a hefty does of Greek and Roman material.

The practical popularity of this mix of Arabic and ancient material reignited a lot of philosophical arguments which had lain pretty dormant in poor, divided Europe for almost five hundred years. That led Europeans to develop broader appetite for ancient culture and history in general: first the revival of secular Latin literature, and then the recovery of Greek literature in the 15th and 16th centuries.

The first wave of translations from the 10th to the 12th century included a lot of Arabic to Latin translations of both Greek originals and Arabic commentaries on the originals. However it also included other translations — particularly from Norman Sicily and the short-lived Latin states in Greece and the Holy Land. The second wave of translations came from the libraries and monasteries of the Byzantine empire, both before and after its fall. Nowadays, the actual Greek texts we read are — with a handful of exceptions — translated directly from Byzantine version.

* “European” implies, of course, that the Byzantine / Orthodox world doesn’t count as “European” — which of course is not true, for reasons that will be clear farther on in the answer. For simplicity’s sake though I’m not going to insert “Western” or “Latin” or “Catholic” in front of “European”, but you can assume it. In the Orthodox world, the Greek texts were never lost although many of them were marginalized. Greeks scholars generally preferred Plato (who, among other things, was a much more elegant writer) and only rarely cared for Aristotle. But a Greek scholar who wanted to lay his hands on a manuscript of Aristotle could probably find one.

__†__  Only the first two sections of the [Organon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organon) were available in Latin before the 12th century. Aristotle’s philosophical reputation had been pretty low in the late Roman period.

__‡__  Somewhat ironically, Aristippus’ direct translation of the Greek [Almagest ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest)was less popular than Gerard of Cremona’s Arabic-originated version.
