Generally speaking paleontology was not a topic of first importance in antique science.

The most famous examples are really mythological, rather than scientific. It’s widely believed (we can’t prove it, but it certainly suggestive) that the legend of the Cyclops began with the femurs, ribcages and skulls of mastodons. There may be an earlier source for the hypothesis but my favorite is the marvelous [Adventures in Unhistory](http://amzn.to/2CJ45AK) by the inimitable Avram Davidson.

A similar origin has been proposed for stories of the legendary griffin, which was supposed to inhabit the steppes of Central Asia. That’s been tentatively connected to the remains of Protoceratops or similar ceratopsians which are found in that region. There’s a fun fictionalized account of a Greek merchant who finds a triceratops skull and wants to earn fame as a natural philosopher by bringing it to Athens in Harry Turtledove’s [The Gryphon’s Skull](http://amzn.to/2FhR6aQ).

Probably the most “scientific” fossil mention that is frequently cited is a remark by [Xenophanes of Colophon](http://www.iep.utm.edu/xenoph/) (died ~480 BC).

> Xenophanes believes that once the earth was mingled with the sea, but in the course of time it became freed from moisture; and his proofs are such as these: that shells are found in the midst of the land and among the mountains, that in the quarries of Syracuse the imprints of a fish and of seals had been found, and in Paros the imprint of an anchovy at some depth in the stone, and in Melite shallow impressions of all sorts of sea products. He says that these imprints were made when everything long ago was covered with mud, and then the imprint dried in the mud. Farther he says that all men will be destroyed when the earth sinks into the sea and becomes mud, and that the race will begin anew from the beginning; and this transformation takes place for all worlds.

We owe the preservation of this story to a text called [Philosophumena; or, The refutation of all heresies](https://archive.org/stream/philosophumenaor01hippuoft/philosophumenaor01hippuoft_djvu.txt) found in the Greek Orthodox monastery on Mt. Athos in the 1840’s. Fossil sea-shells were well known; Herodotus noted them in his trip to Egypt, and later there was a lively argument around the origin of sea shells in the Egyptian desert and the highlands of Armenia. Scholars all agreed this was evidence of lands once under water, but they disagreed on how things had changed — whether stranded seashells were evidence of an ancient flood, of earthquakes changing the landscape, of climate change and so on.

There’s a [large fossil bed on the island of Samos,](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Uwe_Ring/publication/250275770_Samos_Island_Part_II_Ancient_history_of_the_Samos_fossils_and_the_record_of_earthquakes/links/566ec81208aea0892c52a8e4/Samos-Island-Part-II-Ancient-history-of-the-Samos-fossils-and-the-record-of-earthquakes.pdf) which led a natural philosopher named Euphorion to speculate that at some point in the past the island had been dominated by large, fierce beasts he called [Neades](http://www.theoi.com/Thaumasios/Neades.html). Some of these bones were displayed in a temple sanctuary on the island. The fierce roars of the Neades were said to have split the ground since the area displays visible fault lines. Other writers believed that the island sported the bones of Amazons, possibly a reference to a large number of proto-horse fossils in the island that may have been mistaken for the woman-warriors’ mounts.

Notable collectors of fossils included emperors[ Augustus, Tiberius, Hadrian and Constantine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drsarahbond/2016/06/29/roman-emperors-monster-bones-and-the-early-history-of-fossil-hunting/#3a5f2b8e7f05). St. Jerome also relates that Constantine traveled to Antioch to see a “satyr” preserved in salt — probably a fake, although a small number of salt-preserved bodies have been found in the region, As late as the Byzantine era, visitors to the city of Beneventum in Italy saw the ‘tusks of the Calydonian boar’ — which, at 26 inches or more, must have been those of an immature mammoth. While these bones attracted interest, it tended to be more on the order of erudite curiosity than sober inquiry. [Phlegon of Tralles,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlegon_of_Tralles) who documented several other finds of large bones, did so in the [Book of Marvels](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/phlegon-of-tralles-book-of-marvels-9780859894258?cc=us&lang=en&) — a kind of ancient Ripley’s Believe-It-Or-Not.

There’s a book-length treatment of Greco-Roman paleontology in [The First Fossil Hunters: Dinosaurs, Mammoths, and Myth in Greek and Roman Times](http://amzn.to/2Dj97UX)
