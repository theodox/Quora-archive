A handful of collectors did collect what we’d call remains — sometimes fossilized, sometimes newer bones rather than fossils — but they there was no real systematic effort to build that observation into a coherent theory about the past. The most common responses were to fit the findings into the rough outlines of mythical history — so, for example, a Roman era collector in southern Italy used to show a set of 26-inch tusks (probably, those of an immature mammoth) as the tusks of the [Calydonian Boar](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Monsters/Calydonian_Boar/calydonian_boar.html).
