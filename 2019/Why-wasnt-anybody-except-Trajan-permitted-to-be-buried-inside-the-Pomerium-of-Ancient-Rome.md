# Why wasn't anybody, except Trajan, permitted to be buried inside the Pomerium of Ancient Rome?

The pomoerium marked an exclusively civilian and religious space. As such, it was hedged around with a bunch of taboos. For Romans a _templum_  was not a building, but the properly laid out ritual enclosure where the a temple building stood. The pomoerium marked a kind of super-_templum,_ and it had more or less the the same kinds of ritual prohibitions as a temple.

The lack of burials within the pomoerium relates to this idea. Generally human blood and things closely tied to it were regarded as ritually impure — weapons and corpses but also childbirth, menstruation and sexual intercourse were all supposed to ritually insulated from sacred spaces. In the case of the pomoerium this translated into things like a prohibition on capital punishment (inside the pomoerium a magistrate could order a beating, but no an execution) and a taboo on weapons (even lictors had to remove the axes from their fasces within the pomoerium).

In the case of burials, the ritual tradition held that_sua morte extincta omnia funesta sunt,_ “everything that dies on its own is impure,” so that corpses did not belong within the sacred space of the pomoerium. You can get a sense of the distinction from Plutarch’s account of _pomoeria_ in _[Roman Questions](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0211%3Asection%3D27)_ _:_ 

> __Why do [Romans] regard all the city wall as inviolable and sacred, but not the gates?__ 

> Is it, as Varro has written, because the wall must be considered sacred that men may fight and die with enthusiasm in its defence? It was under such circumstances, it seems, that Romulus killed his brother because he was attempting to leap across a place that was inviolable and sacred, and to make it traversable and profane.

> But it was impossible to consecrate the gates, for through them they carry out many other objectionable things and also dead bodies. Wherefore the original founders of a city yoke a bull and a cow, and mark out with a plough all the land on which they intend to build; and when they are engaged in tracing the circuit of the walls, as they measure off the space intended for gates, they lift up the ploughshare and thus carry the plough across, since they hold that all the land that is ploughed is to be kept sacred and inviolable.

All that said, it’s not strictly true that Trajan was the only person buried within the pomoerium.

The most famous exemption is for the Vestal Virgins, who lived and were buried within the pomoerium, presumably because their vows kept them free from ritual impurities. But the Vestals could also be buried in the city another way too — those who who violated their oaths were buried alive behind the Colline Gate. That was inside the pomoerium, but — for ritual purposes— without bloodshed.

There were also a handful of famous statesmen who were buried within the city. Cicero’s dialog _[On the Laws](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/cicero-treatise-on-the-laws)_ __ includes this exchange:

> —How is it, that notwithstanding this law of the Twelve Tables, so many of our great men have been buried in the city?

> —I believe, my Atticus, that this privilege was granted before this law was made, to certain heroic worthies, as Publicola and Tubertus, on account of their virtue, and that their descendents have succeeded to this privilege, though it is an exception to the law. Some others may since have gained this privilege, like Caius Fabricius, whose virtue has in some sense made them free of the laws. The civil law, in all other cases, forbids burials in the city, and the Pontifical College has decreed that it is unlawful to raise a sepulchre in the public places.

An [imperial era writer ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+11.205)echoes the same idea: “emperors and vestal Virgins, on whom the laws have no hold, have their tombs within the city” — although in fact, we don’t know how many emperors were buried within the city. Many of the Julio-Claudian emperors, along with Titus and Vespasian, were interred within the mausoleum of Augustus which was outside the pomoerium but well within the Aurelian walls, so it’s also possible that he’s just a bit confused. However it could be that he only meant Trajan and Julius Caesar whose ashes interred in his temple in the forum.
