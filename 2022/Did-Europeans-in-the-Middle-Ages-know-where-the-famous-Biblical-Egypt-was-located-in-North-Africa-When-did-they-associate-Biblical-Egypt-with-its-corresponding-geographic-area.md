Literacy and general knowledge were of course unevenly distributed — but any educated person will have seen something like this:

It’s not very precise as a representation of the globe — this style of map has more in common with a modern subway map than with Google Earth — but it shows the set of relationships that were commonly recognized.

East (“__Oriens__ ”) is at the top. In a small label at top center you see __gens Seres__ , that is, “the nation of the Chinese.” Just below and to the right of that is a more detailed view of India, with the Ganges and the Hypanis draining “up” into the surrounding Ocean. The three large horizontally oriented rivers in the top-right quarter are the Indus, the Tigris, and the Euphrates.

Europe is to the lower left, divided from Asia by the Bosporus and a very truncated Black Sea. Interestingly, the Adriatic is quite visible, separating Italy from “__Acaia__ ”, that is, Greece — but the Western Mediterranean totally schematic and does not appear visibly in between Spain and Italy). __Roma,__ Rome, is visible in the middle

In this map Africa is at the lower right. “Africa” has it’s old Roman meaning, that is, the coastal regions of Libya, Tunisia and Algeria — that’s why the label is smaller. The continent of Africa is labelled __Libia__ , which is what a Roman author would have used as well. Egypt is visible (as __Egipt__ , a mis-spelling of the proper Latin _Aegyptus)_ and you can see the Nile leading towards __Aethiopia__ ; however this again is the Roman Aethiopia which corresponds to our Sudan, not to the modern nation of Ethiopia. The Red Sea is visible to the far right, colored red, separating Egypt from Arabia. And __Judea__  is visible above and to the left of Egypt.

This map — known as the [Beatus map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatus_map), after its original author, a monk named Beatus of Liebana — dates from around the year 1000 and is a good example of a mid-market map. It reflects the information that was commonly available through standard medieval texts (Beatus based a lot of his work on information provided by a fellow Spaniard, [Isidore of Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville) — one of the most common medieval reference books. It makes a good proxy for what an educated but non-expert person would know about the world.

More geographically precise works were available, though they were not common; less specific, even more highly abstracted ones were available widely but tended to be used for decorative rather than practical purposes. There were also very practical [handbooks for traders, crusaders, and pilgrims](https://www.quora.com/How-did-people-on-crusades-from-Europe-know-which-route-to-use-to-get-to-Jerusalem-Were-roads-mapped-out-or-signs-in-place-that-said-Jerusalem-this-way/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=299960438&share=cbda9c17&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer), the medieval equivalent of travel books.
