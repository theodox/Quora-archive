There‚Äôs no hard and fast date ‚Äî the transition was part of a millennia-long evolution of the Egyptian language, rather than a dateable government decree. Coptic gradually becomes dominant between the second and fourth centuries as the older language traditions faded out rapidly.

The [last known hieroglyphic inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffito_of_Esmet-Akhom) is a graffito on the temple at Philae from the year 394. Interestingly it‚Äôs not actually for one of the classical Egyptian gods: the writer prays to [Mandulis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandulis), whose cult originated south of the border in Nubia. Mandulis gained popularity in Egypt during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods.

However most ordinary Egyptian writing had used other media for a long, long time before the Hieroglyphic script petered out. The [Hieratic script](https://omniglot.com/writing/egyptian_hieratic.htm) emerged very early in Egyptian history as an easier way to write on using a brush pen on papyrus or clay ‚Äî examples go back all the way to the first dynasty. Although it includes a few shortcuts, Hieratic began as just a visual simplification of the hieroglyphic system ‚Äî it retained the very complex mix of phonetic and ideographic writing that makes Hieroglyphic so challenging. Nonetheless Hieratic was the real dominant Egyptian writing system for two and a half millennia ‚Äî hieroglyphics were mostly reserved for formal settings: temples, tombs and so on. Most texts, particularly those on papyrus, were Hieratic until around the time of the Persian conquest.

However the Egyptian language continued to move on. By around 2000 BC the Egyptian language had evolved into what‚Äôs known as Middle Egyptian, the classical form of the language and the one you‚Äôll typically learn if you take a college course on hieroglyphs. Over the course of the next millennium and a half, the spoken language continued to evolve but the written forms ‚Äî Hieroglyphic and Hieratic ‚Äî remained closely tied to formal Middle Egyptian ‚Äî and thus, they became increasingly unfamiliar to ordinary people. You can roughly analogize this to the Italy of 1600 where educated people would recognize and be familiar with Latin, but where everyone spoke a vernacular language distantly descended and quite distinct from it.

As a result a new script emerged that was better adapted to the realities of contemporary Egyptian speech. The [Demotic script](https://omniglot.com/writing/egyptian_demotic.htm) first emerged around the end of the Nubian occupation of Egypt (circa 650 BC) as a simplified version of Hieratic used to record everyday speech. Demotic retained a lot of the complexity of Hieratic and Hieroglyphic ‚Äî it had a mix of syllable, ideographic, and conceptual signs ‚Äî but over time it became more and more of a consonantal abjad (more about the details of this process [here](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Ancient-Egyptians-use-their-own-alphabet-for-writing-Coptic-texts-If-so-why-did-they-also-use-Greek-letters/answer/Steve-Theodore)).

Demotic was the written medium of everyday from around the end of the Nubian occupation all the way into the first few centuries of the Roman era (so, roughly 650 BC to 300 AD). Throughout that period Hieroglyphic and Hieratic remained in use for formal purposes, but they were increasingly relegated to purely ritual and literary uses. Spoken and written Demotic was the real language of Egypt. Even under the Greeks, Ptolemaic courts recognized Demotic for legal purposes ‚Äî when the Rosetta Stone was carved, almost all of the Egyptians who read it read the Demotic version.

Although Demotic flourished under the Ptolemies, the prevalence of Greek began to affect the attitudes of many literate Egyptians. The lower ranks of the Ptolemaic bureaucracy were staffed by Egyptians who were bilingual in Greek, and the relative simplicity of the Greek alphabet was an appealing contrast to Demotic with its inherited complexities. Around the first century of our era an increasing number of informal texts [show efforts to record the Egyptian language (by now , becoming what we‚Äôd call ‚ÄúCoptic‚Äù) using Greek characters](https://www.quora.com/What-factual-evidence-do-novice-and-professional-linguists-give-to-show-against-evidence-from-Jean-Francois-Champollion-that-Coptic-is-derived-from-Greek/answer/Steve-Theodore). This didn‚Äôt happen over night, but by around the third century a standard Coptic alphabet had emerged, borrowing a few characters from Demotic for uniquely Egyptian sounds. ‚Äî this led to a rapid explosion of Coptic texts as popular literacy took off.

Over the next couple of centuries ‚Äî say, the years from 100 to 300 ‚Äî the remaining elements of Hieratic and Hieroglyphic writing traditions faded out. As the traditional Egyptian religion declined, the scribal traditions which were linked to the temples also went into decay, and by this point Egypt had been governed in Greek for more than half a millennium. By the end of the third century very few Egyptians could read either Hieroglyphic or Hieratic, and Egyptian popular literacy was focused almost exclusively on Coptic. As early as the fourth century ‚Äî while pilgrims from Nubia were still visiting the Pharaonic temples in southern Egypt ‚Äî there seems to be almost nobody in Egypt who could make sense out of the older writings. When the fifth century Alexandrian writer Horapollo tried to write a guide to Hieroglyphic inscriptions (one which would be the only guide to the ancient writings for more than a thousand years) he had nothing to offer but impressive-sounding nonsense.
