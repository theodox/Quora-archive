Yes, although the difference between "requesting asylum" and "invading" is perhaps a somewhat subtle one to modern eyes. 

The Goths, in particular, wanted to get away from the Huns so they entered into agreements -- with a mix of diplomacy, intimidation, and combat -- which let them settle in the Danube provinces. The first big migration was under [Fritigern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritigern), who was allowed to settle one the Roman side of the Danube by [Valens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valens). The agreement quickly broke down, resulting in the first [Gothic War (376â€“382)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_War_%28376%E2%80%93382%29). 

For the next few generations the relations between the Goths and both empires teetered back and forth between cooperation and warfare in a variety of confusing ways (see [What were the sackings of Rome in the year 410 by the Goths and Vandals like? Were they organized or did they just ride through the city slashing, burning and pillaging?](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging)).

The porous border was not new, various groups had been allowed in to strengthen the frontiers and reduce pressure on the border armies since at least the time of the [Marcomannic Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcomannic_Wars), but since the Romans had long relied on subsidies and close relationships with the peoples just across the border the shift from employing them as allies to inviting them in as citizens was not too dramatic.
