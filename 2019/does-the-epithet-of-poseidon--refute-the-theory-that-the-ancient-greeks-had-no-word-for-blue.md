Not exactly. [The “no-Greek-blue” theory is dubious for other reasons](https://www.quora.com/Did-ancient-people-perceive-less-colours-than-us/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=b8bb2fce&srid=zLvM); you don’t need to pull Poseidon in. However its true the root word [κυανός ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dku%2Fanos)is definitely connected with blue: as a noun, κυανός can refer to lapis lazuli or to azurite: a naturally occurring mineral that most of us would describe as blue:

On the other hand, one the uses that you can put azurite to create a “blacking enamel” for bronze: if you heat azurite the right way it turns nearly black and makes a good enamel protectant. Even today you can, apparently, order a BMW today in a shiny blue-black “Azurite black” finish. Agamemnon's’ armor in the Iliad had δέκα οἶμοι μέλανος κυάνοιο, “ten stripes dark with κυανός” for decoration.

So, most classicists think κυανοχαίτης just refers to very dark hair, rather than “blue hair” per se — in fact, the word also appears in reference to a horse’s mane in Homer and Hesiod.

That said, it’s possible that κυανοχαίτης is a self conscious pun in which the “blue” meaning of κυανός and the “black” meaning of κυανός are deliberately conflated. Eventually — in the Roman era — κυανός was explicitly used for the color of seawater. However we don’t know how far back that usage goes.
