Traditionally the aeacid dynasty in Epirus traces its origin to Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles (he also used the nickname “Pyrrhus” or “Redhead” which is why that name is very common among Epirote royalty.

We don’t know a lot about the first three or four centuries between the time the Homeric stories formalized — around 800 BC, at a rough guess — and the point at which the Molossians started claiming Achilles as an ancestor in their dealings with the rest of Greece. The fact that the line starts with “Molossus”, a son of Neoptolemus who does not show up elsewhere in early sources makes the genealogy rather suspect— making up ancestors with an ethnonym for a name was practically the national sport of every peripheral group that wanted to pass for “civilized” in Greek circles. On the other hand there’s a lot of linguistic evidence pointing to the northwest as the the ancient cradle of the Greek language. So, it’s very hard to be sure.

Our limited data could be made to fit a rough-and-ready backwater part of the Greek world, living on as a kind of historical reenactment of the Bronze Age world depicted by Homer — or it could also be made to fit a non-Greek community, Illyrian or something very similar, that adopted Greek language sometime before say the 8th century BC and gradually assimilated itself into the cultural world of the city states over the next four centuries or so. Lacking better evidence we have to lean towards being tentative.

We do know that in historic times Epirote royalty, like their Macedonian neighbors, practiced polygyny and married, at least occasionally, with their Illyrian and Thracian neighbors (Pyrrhus himself spent a chunk of his boyhood in Illyria at the court of [Glaucias of Taulantii](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucias_of_Taulantii) , who himself had a Molossian wife from Pyrrhus’s family). So it is safe to assume that there was a good deal of intermixing among the upper classes: diplomatic marriages seem to have been common in this region, helped along by endemic low-grade warfare and polygamy. So, Pyrrhus might have bragged about being a descendant of Achilles but he was unlikely to fit any definition of “pure blooded”
