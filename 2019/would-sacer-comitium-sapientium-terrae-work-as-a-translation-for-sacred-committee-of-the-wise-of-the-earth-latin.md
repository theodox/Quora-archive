A bit depends on what you really want here.

_Sacra comitia sapientium_ is pretty close to “sacred committee of the wise”, but _comitia_  has a pretty precise meaning in Latin which is rather different from its bureaucratized meaning in English: If you said _comitia_ to a Roman they’d be imagining a big public assembly, like the _[comitia centuriata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centuriate_Assembly)_ __ which elected the consuls — not a few wise heads sequestered in a meeting room thinking things over.

If you don’t need a precisely classical feel, _curia —_ which means any kind of deliberative grouping — works well. By the middle ages this was the word used for the close advisors of the king or the Pope, the “cabinet” so to speak. Even today the Roman Curia is the top administrative bureau of the church.

Another alternative would be _[collegium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegium_(ancient_Rome))_ _—_ a college was one of the few corporate entities in Roman law; most of them were things like groups of priests entrusted with the care of a particular shrine, which sounds like it might be what you’re seeking. In that case _collegium sacrum sapientium_ .

The other element is _terrae._ It’s OK, though I’d consider _[Telluris](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dtellus)_ __ as well. “Tellus” is as close as Latin comes to distinguishing our world from others — and it also functions as a religious personification of the world, a kind of male Gaia.

In all of these word order is irrelevant.
