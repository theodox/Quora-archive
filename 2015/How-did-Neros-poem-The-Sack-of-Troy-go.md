We don't have the text: it was a hostile rumor in antiquity and it's not clear whether the "performance", if it actually happened, was an original composition or a recitation of something classical (Homer, or possibly Virgil).

The story about Nero comes mostly from politically hostile sources. [LacusCurtius ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/15B*.html) - not a fan of Nero, but who took his responsibilities as a chronicler very seriously puts it like this:



> Annals XV.[39](http://...) .... as a relief to the homeless and fugitive populace, [Nero] opened the Campus Martius, the buildings of Agrippa, even his own Gardens, and threw up a number of extemporized shelters to accommodate the helpless multitude. The necessities of life were brought up from Ostia and the neighbouring municipalities, and the price of grain was lowered to three sesterces. Yet his measures, popular as their character might be, failed of their effect; for the report had spread that, at the very moment when Rome was aflame, he had mounted his private stage, and typifying the ills of the present by the calamities of the past, had sung the destruction of Troy.


Tacitus (like a lot of other Roman aristocrats) was pretty scandalized by Nero's willingness to appear on stage as a performer - something one step up from being a prostitute in ordinary Roman opinion, and utterly unfitting to the dignity of an emperor. Nero had performed publicly not long before the fire, irritating traditionalists, which is probably the source of the original rumor. 

[Suetonius ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#ref122), a less scrupulous historian, is much more definite. He blames Nero for starting the fire on purpose to give himself an opportunity to rebuild the city in his own image:



> Nero 38.... Viewing the conflagration from the tower of Maecenas and exulting, as he said, in "the beauty of the flames," he sang the whole of the "Sack of Ilium,"in his regular stage costume. [3](http://...) Furthermore, to gain from this calamity too all the spoil and booty possible, while promising the removal of the debris and dead bodies free of cost he allowed no one to approach the ruins of his own property; and from the contributions which he not only received, but even demanded, he nearly bankrupted the provinces and exhausted the resources of individuals


Nero did write things which survived him. Nero's collected works, the _Liber Dominicus_ , were still circulating for a while after his death: the very short lived emperor (and former Nero crony) [Vitellius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitellius) started his brief, unpopular career by having one of Nero's compositions performed in public. But we don't have the text. 

To be fair to Nero, [Seneca ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger)appears to have thought Nero's works were actually pretty good -- though, living in the court of an emperor who had a hair trigger (and eventually obliged Seneca to commit suicide) may have influenced his judgement.
