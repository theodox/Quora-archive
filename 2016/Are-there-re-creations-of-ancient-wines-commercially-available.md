I once found a vintage, supposedly from the slopes of mount Aetna, in Las Vegas of all places. It that was supposed to be "authentic" -- it was supposed to be aged and stored in clay amphora and produced using Roman-era varietals. It was light and a bit sweet, more like a thin rose than either a conventional red or white. I liked it but I have no idea how authentic it was. I think this might be the place:
