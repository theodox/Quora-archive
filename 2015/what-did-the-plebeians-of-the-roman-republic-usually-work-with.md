The plebeians were not really an 'underclass' for most of the Republic's history. The [Conflict of the Orders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_the_Orders) is the fancy modern term for the long struggle between the plebeians (the 'commoners') and the patricians (the 'nobles'). 

Between roughly 500 and 300 BC the plebeians broke the monopoly of the old families on political power, using (among other things) the tactic of simply walking out of the city: essentially [the first general strike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secessio_plebis).

However the main reason this worked was because the plebeians were not uniformly poor and downtrodden: By the 4th century BC in particularly there were many wealthy powerful plebeians who resented being barred from political power solely because of their lack of 'breeding' . In the late republic the ' upper classes' were the _nobilitas_  or the _optimates_  - terms which embraced the wealthy and powerful of both Plebeian and Patrician clans. [Lucullus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucullus), [Crassus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Crassus), and [Pompey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey_the_Great), for example, three of the richest men in Roman history, were all of Plebeian origin.
