This is the oldest known record of slavery:

It records the fact that a Sumerian named Gal-Sal ð’ƒ²ð’Š© (lower left) owned two slaves ð’†³ð’Š© (top left) __, Sukkal-Gir__  (center right) ð’ˆ›ð’„Šand __En-Pap__ (?) ð’‚—ð’‰½(top right, partly unreadable).

This tablet it is from what was then the city of [Shurrupak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuruppak) and is now [Tell Fara ](https://www.aiamilitarypanel.org/profiles/cptraining/iraq05-086.html)in modern Iraq. Itâ€™s around 5,000 years old. Itâ€™s one of the oldest mentions of any named individuals. Since two thirds of these individuals are slaves, itâ€™s a good bet that the institution was already pretty widespread before the dawn of writing.



_Note the cuneiform font here represents the writing of more than a thousand years after this tablet â€”_ _[the archaic versions of the signs are here](https://cdli.ucla.edu/tools/SignLists/protocuneiform/archsigns.html)_ _._
