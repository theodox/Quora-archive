There really was not 'official designation' - its a modern bureaucratic habit that did not really exist in ancient times.

In the pre-republican times -- in most of the Late Bronze/Early Iron age Europe, for that matter -- it was customary to refer to kingdoms using ethnic rather than geographical or institutional names: When Rome fought against Veii or Etruria, the usual Roman expressions would be to say "The Romans fought the Veientines' or 'The Etruscans attacked the Romans" -- our modern habit of using state names ("Rome attacked Veii") was used but not commonly. Royal "titles" were done the same way, so a king of Rome was mostly the _Rex Romanorum,_ "king of the Romans". 

In Republican times, the [ethnonym](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnonym) _Romani,_ ie Romans remained the most normal; way of talking about the Roman people, it's army, and its institutions . _Populus_ , the people, really means something like "the free men of military age", that is, the citizen militia that was the original army of the Republic -- eventually it came to mean 'the voting public', and by extension all Romans. The Populus was technically the source of all laws and offices. The Senate was supposed to be an advisory body that worked _for_ the Populus; in practice, of course, it ran the state but in _theory_  the Populus _was_  the state. The common formula SPQR, as the other answers note, was supposed to underline that both the People and their most respected leaders were endorsing or claiming something.

_Romano (with an implied 'populo': "On behalf of the Roman People"_ 

The actual term "Res Publica' translates literally into several odd phrases: 


 'public thing' 

'publlic treasury'

'public matters'

It is thought the originally have referred to the public treasure housed in the temples, administered by the Senate for the good of the city. It was not really an 'official name' in the same way that the 'official name' of the UK is "__United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"__ , but it was the common way by which Romans referred to the long-term history of their state. _Res Romana_  was also used, it's probably a little closer to what we would mean by "The Roman State", but it was not a title. 

They also used _Urbs_ , "the city" -- by which the really meant __the__  City, that is Rome. This was most common when the geography was a part of what they were discussing, but it could also be used for things like "the mood of the city was ..." and so on. _Roma_ , "Rome" was pretty common on coins (it's impossible to tell when that means Rome the place, and when Rome the goddess, the personification of Rome's fortunes: the distinction may not be meaningful anyway). However it would be quite rare for a writer or speaker to say "Roma did this" -- it would always be "The Romans did this".

_Imperium,_ or "Empire" carries multiple overtones. It can mean military command: the Senate grants _imperium_  to a field commander for the duration of his appointment. It can also mean 'right to lead': the right by which the Romans exercised leadership over their allies and tributaries. _Imperium populi Romani_ , "the power of the Roman people", was a common way of describing what we would call the Roman Empire. It was a way of speaking, though, not an actual institutional name. 

The replacement of the Republic by the Empire changed some of the terms. Because Augustus and his successors were careful to keep permanent military command -- without expecting it to be renewed by anybody else -- they emphasized the _imperium_  as if it were a personal property. _Imperator_ , "Emperor", literally just means "military commander" and in older times was a common title for any successful general: the Emperors hoarded it for themselves until it came to have it's modern meaning. (Ironically, if you find coins issued by Brutus and Cassius, who killed Caesar, these arch-republicans usually plaster _"IMP"_ for _imperator_  all over their coins:

_Front, Brutus Imperator, Reverse: "The Ides of March"_ 

_Dominium,_  English "dominion", is another Latin word for power -- but one which in Latin has a clear implication that the _dominus_  is a slave-owner: the Romans tended not to use that about their relations with subjects, or the emperor's relationship with the public, until pretty late: It became an official imperial title only with Diocletian (in 284), and some historians refer to his intensely centralized system of rule as the _Dominate,_ contrasting it with the _Principate_  of Augustus. 

Throughout all of this, though, the ethonym "the Romans" would remain the most common way of talking about the Roman people, it's instutions, it's army and its territory. The Byzantines and their Greek descendants continued to be Ῥωμαῖοι, "Romans" right down until the 19th century.
