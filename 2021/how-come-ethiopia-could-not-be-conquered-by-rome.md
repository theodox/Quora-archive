For the most part, it was easier to get along than to fight.

If you look at ancient sources you’ll see “Aethiopia” but it’s a much vaguer placename than the modern state of Ethiopia.

In Greek and Roman texts “Aethiopia” sometimes meant the [Kingdom of Kush](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/kingdoms-kush/) — headquartered in Modern Sudan, from the first or second cataract the Nile down to the Sudd — but it sometimes meant “anyplace where dark skinned people lived,” (in some contexts could refer to India or either coast of Africa). The Romans did fight one border war with “Aethiopia”, but never had a conflict with the rulers of what is today Ethiopia.

The kingdom of Kush, immediately south of Roman Egypt, did fight one brief war with Rome. Right after Augustus Caesar conquered Egypt (starting in 30 BC), Kushite armies raided Upper Egypt; in return a Roman army raided as far south as [Napata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napata), near the fourth cataract. However it’s quite hard to carry on a war through the bottleneck formed by the cataracts of the Nile, so both sides ended up back within their original borders and peace was negotiated by around 20 BC. As far as we can tell, this peace lasted as long as the Kushite kingdom did.

The Kushite state began to fall apart in the 3rd century, and in the 4th it seems to have been mostly conquered by a new power from the south, the [Axumite Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum) which was ruled from Axum, in what is today northern Ethiopia. The Axumites had become powerful as part of the vibrant [Indian Ocean trade](https://www.quora.com/I-have-heard-that-ancient-Greece-and-Rome-were-having-trades-with-south-Indian-kingdoms-But-in-history-why-werent-these-given-much-importance-and-not-talked-about/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=13854077&share=70e19e91&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer), which connected Roman Egypt, India, and East Africa in a very lucrative commercial network. They controlled vital ports at the mouth of the Red Sea (often, on both sides: they frequently fought for control of the southern Arabian peninsula).

This situation tended to make for friendly relations: Rome and Axum didn’t share a border, and the Indian Ocean trade made both parties rich but required both to participate. As a result, the Axumites developed close economic and social ties with Roman Egypt and vice-versa. Egypt was ahead of the rest of the Roman empire in embracing Christianity in the late third and early fourth centuries — Axum did so at almost the same time. In fact it was the Axumite king [Ezana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezana_of_Axum) who issued the first explicitly Christian coins in the world (around the year 325) when Roman coins were still depicting traditional Roman deities. The modern Ethiopian Orthodox Church derives ultimately from the close connections between Roman Egypt and Axum.

From around the mid-fourth century to the time of the Arab conquests, Rome and Axum were generally on pretty good terms. In the early sixth century, Roman emperor Justinian [tried to establish a closer alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonnosus_(historian)), but nothing concrete emerged. However in the later sixth century Roman and Axumite armies fought against the Sassanid Persians at the same time — though never on the same field battle. A good account of Roman-Axumite relations can be found in Glen Bouwersock’s [The Throne of Adulis](https://www.amazon.com/Throne-Adulis-Islam-Emblems-Antiquity/dp/0199739323).
