[Mesopotamia: The Invention of the City](http://amzn.to/1eqICj9) is a pretty decent introduction to the area. It leans a bit towards the post-modern / culture studies school. [Babylon: Mesopotamia and the Birth of Civilization](http://amzn.to/1HCtASS) is a decent general account focused primarily on Babylon; it's makes an interesting counterpoint to The Invention of the City and is a bit more 'journalistic' and less academic. [The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character ](http://amzn.to/1RazYan)by Samuel Noah Kramer (as [Suzanne Marie Redalia Sullivan](https://www.quora.com/profile/Suzanne-Marie-Redalia-Sullivan) points out, he was the the biggest name in modern Sumeriology) is good and walks the like between scholarly and readable, with good original source material. [ Treasures of the Darkness ](http://amzn.to/1HCurD9)by Thorkild Jacobsen is another one of the big scholarly names and it includes a lot of source as well. 

I haven't read the [Historical Atlas of Ancient Mesopotamia](http://amzn.to/1LJu37D) but I always get a lot of value out of picture laden coffee-table atlases: good for context if not for detail.

[Empires of the Plain: Henry Rawlinson and the Lost Languages of Babylon ](http://amzn.to/1gfFd8d)is a great account of the translation of Sumerian and Akkadian language. It's more about the 19th century than the -25th but it has a lot of great detail nonetheless.
