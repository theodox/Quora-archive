It might be more correct to say there is archaeological evidence that’s _consistent_  with a Roman kingdom.

There’s not enough space to cover every find in Rome that predates this sixth century BC. Though there are plenty of findings, they tend to come from the realm of “technical archaeology.” As fascinating as post-holes indicating the presence of a wooden wall might be to an archaeologist, they doesn’t tell us much about the political arrangements or the transition to republican government. The kind of epigraphic evidence we would like is, alas, vanishingly rare for this period: although the Rome of the kings and the early republic was literate, it was not exactly wordy. Moreover the destruction of the city by the Gauls in 387 BC entailed both physical destruction and the theft of many valuable artifacts.

Thus, we’ll have to stick to finds that can be plausibly connected to the literary traditions about the regal era (though “plausible” is a bit of an elastic term in this context).

__The King’s cup__ 

On the purely “did they or didn’t they” level here’s one contemporary mention of a Roman king:

This is a fragment of an Etruscan-style [bucchero](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/art-etruscan/before-500-bce/a/bucchero) blackware inscribed REX (king) that was found near the [Regia](https://ancientromelive.org/regia/)— in historic times, the residence of the pontifex maximus but traditionally described as a one-time royal palace. It’s not a slam-dunk “proof,” since the office of _rex sacrorum_  or “king of sacrifices” survived into historic times; the vessel might belong to a republican king-priest, not a real king. Still, the combination of the find site and the Etruscanate style is extremely suggestive. Bucchero style became prestigious in the seventh century BC: traditionally, the last century of the Roman kingdom, when the ruling house were ethnic Etruscans.

__The Lapis Niger__ 

There’s also mentions of the King on the [Lapis Niger](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-oldest-standing-Roman-monument/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=162042380&share=e40d0322&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer), an enigmatic and very old stele which is carefully buried under the modern surface of the forum. It says (as near as we can make out the very, very archaic Latin)

_Graphic: Wikipedia_ 

It’s too fragmentary for a flowing translation but it looks like later formula for a taboo: we can see “whoever” (quoi ho) and “is liable to be sacrificed” (sakros es) and a few lines below we can see that something will be done “by the king” (regei). At least as of today, the [Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_Niger) contains a couple of the competing readings of this mysterious text. In any event, however, this looks like a genuine survival of a functioning Roman kingdom.

__The “Shrine of Romulus”__ 

Not far from the Lapis Niger is the recently discovered underground shrine dubbed — a bit hyperbolically — the “[Tomb of Romulus](https://www.archaeology.org/issues/406-2101/features/9269-rome-romulus-shrine).”

In fact, this dates from right around the traditional date for the founding of the Republic (_not_ from the time ascribed to Romulus, two and a half centuries before) and it might represent an early-Republican cultic center designed to symbolize the new state. While one version or Romulus’ death has him ascending into the heavens, a counter-tradition has him torn to pieces by Roman senators — perhaps, an attractive myth to commemorate in newly-republican Rome. The empty sarcophagus in the “tomb” might be a deliberate allusion to either version Romulus’s mythical disappearance.

_The dense overlay of politically important spaces in the Forum. The Lapis Niger is just below and to the right of the Graecostasis; the “Romulus shrine roughly where the Rostra and the Curia Julia intersect. Image:_ _[Mark Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curia_Hostilia#/media/File:Curia_Hostilia,_Comitium,_Rostra_and_Lapis_Niger_layout.jpg)_ 

The current [Curia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curia_Julia)building (originally commissioned by Julius Caesar in 44 BC) is the third one on or near the spot. In front of its doors was the [Comitium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comitium), the meeting place of the popular assembly. The location of the Romulus shrine — under the stairs of the Curia — was a place of prime religious-political importance for the Romans, which makes it a good candidate for a bit of early-republican nation-building.

[This area was clearly an important public center for at least a couple of centuries before the shrine was placed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/506300). It was deliberately and extensively regraded to make a firmer, better drained surface in what had been, before the 8th century or so, a marshy drainage area. The area of most intense building (home to the Comitium, the Curia, the Lapis Niger, and the [Vulcanal ](https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/wm10YQT_Vulcanal_Roma_Italy)— an outdoor altar which doubled as a speaker’s platform for political assemblies) began as a rocky outcrop of the Capitol hill that overlooked the forum area. Rome’s political center of gravity remained in the same place long after the landscape had been reworked, raising the floor of the forum and reducing the original prominence of the site. The forum was cobbled sometime in the seventh century BC, based on the dating of some foundation deposits.

Another part of the geotechnical reworking of the forum is the [cloaca maxima ](http://www.digitales-forum-romanum.de/gebaeude/cloaca-maxima/?lang=en)the “great drain” — traditionally attributed to [Tarquinius Priscus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Priscus) (the fifth king, circa 616–578 BC). Today it is mostly underground, but when it was built it was an open waterway. The Cloaca was instrumental in stabilizing the marshy lowland that became the forum. It also divided the western, political side of the forum — where the Comitium and the Curia stood — from the residences of the kings and the Vestal virgins at the eastern end. Excavations have shown not only the stone block which lines the channel but even the post-holes and sockets that held railings and bridges around it.

We don’t have an irreproachable way to date this project to the reign of Priscus but the work includes a new layer of cobbling above the seventh century pavement and is generally dated to the sixth century based on materials and techniques. The size and complexity of the work are certainly suggestive of (though not “proof of”) the story told by Pliny ([Natural History, 36.107](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D36))about grueling working conditions and mutinous workers.

__Jupiter Optimus Maximus__ 

Traditionally, the same king Priscus is also said to have vowed the construction of the [Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus](http://www.museicapitolini.org/en/sede/campidoglio_antico/tempio_di_giove_capitolino) on the Capitoline hill. This was completed by [Tarquinius Superbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus) (the seventh and last king) and dedicated in the first years of the republic. This temples was the largest in Rome for many centuries, and was regarded as the most visible symbol in the city: the Roman equivalent of the Parthenon.

The temple itself is long since gone, overwhelmed by the later temple complexes which sprang up on the Capitoline. However the foundations of temple survive beneath today’s Capitoline Museum, along with the evidence of the ambitious geotechnical work needed to create a site capable of hosting such a large structure. The stone and the techniques resemble those of the Cloaca Maxima.



In the last 20 years we’ve found fragments of the original decorations; they fit well with the traditional account, that the temple was adorned by an Etruscan artist using Etruscan-style terra cotta.

A pair of less famous temples from the regal era lie about fifteen feet under the modern church of St. Omobono in the Forum Boarium, the ancient cattle market near the Tiber. [Excavations in the area are extremely tricky](https://www.archaeology.org/issues/132-1405/trenches/1982-reexcavation-rome-earliest-temple), since they are under the modern water table. However we can see similar Etruscanate artifacts and construction techniques, which helps provide context for dating artifacts from the Forum, the Capitolium, and the Palatine. The finds here and on the Capitol show evidence of significant trade with Etruscan and Greek cities in archaic Rome.

__Servian Walls__ 

One of the great debates in archaic Roman archaeology was the long argument about the existence of a city wall dating back to the Roman kingdom. Most of the literary sources attribute a wall to [Servius Tullius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servius_Tullius) (the sixth king, 578–535 BC) though a few attribute it to other kings. The first two centuries of modern archaeology consistently found fortifications which were clearly much later: the clincher was the identification the prime building material for this wall as _tufo giallo_ from the quarries of Veii - not conquered by Rome until 396 BC. The archaeological evidence coincided with a high-water mark in skeptical approaches to ancient texts, leading many 20th century studies to dismiss the regal-era “Servian Walls” as a later myth (as of today, the [Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servian_Wall) repeats this claim).

However, in the last generation the picture has been complicated considerably. The discovery of a substantial 8th century wall at the foot of the Palatine in 1988 undermined the argument that archaic Rome was too small or too poor for substantial fortifications. Since the mid 90’s Italian archaeologists have identified what they see as several fragments of mid-sixth century fortifications interspersed among the more visible, later walls. Their date would be roughly correct for Servius Tullius. The archaic wall sections use a different stone, different construction techniques, and a different standard of measurement. This remains a hotly debated topic among archaeologists, but there seems to be at least _some_ physical reality to the traditional idea of a Servian wall. A recent (2012) survey of the debate [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41725315) suggests a middle ground, positing discontinuous regal-era fortifications on the city hilltops, perhaps connected by earthworks.

__The “Royal Palace”__ 

The conflict over the Servian Walls, however, is just a minor skirmish alongside the most controversial archaeological questions around regal Rome.

[Andrea Carandini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Carandini), the editor of the [Atlas of Ancient Rome](http://atlasofancientrome.com/), has led a series of digs in the forum and the Palatine which have unearthed rare, and hitherto unseen, evidence for the archaic city. Among the most striking finds is what Carandini calls a “[royal palace](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/feb/15/artsandhumanities.arts)” under what is now known as either the [Temple of Romulus or the Basilica of Sts. Cosmas and Damian](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanforum/romulus.html). The area was, in historic times, known as the [Regia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regia) and housed the pontifex maximus, the senior priest of the Roman stare religion. Carandini’s excavations show that the historic regia was occupied by series of monumental buildings dating back to the 8th century; in his view, this is consistent with the traditional date for the founding of the city, 753 BC.

However Carandini is a controversial figure in Roman archaeology. He champions an approach which places a heavy emphasis on the use of surviving textual evidence — something many other archaeologists treat with suspicion (or, occasionally, disdain). Unsurprisingly his [claims about a royal palace have been challenged](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/06/world/europe/some-say-his-digging-up-of-a-legend-is-just-a-myth.html). Carandini’s opponents tend to accuse him of taking myths and unreliable historical accounts literally. His defenders say he uses the texts to help interpret solid, tangible archaeological facts.

You can get your own sense for his rather theatrical approach — and the way it sometimes elides the difference between the provable and the impressionistic — from his less-technical overview of archaic Rome, titled _[Rome, Day One](https://amzn.to/3uMeidy)_ __ in English.

Despite its attendant dramas, however, Carandini’s work has forced a reappraisal of a poorly attested time in Roman history: it was he who found that 8th century Palatine wall, which at least shows that Rome was more than _just_ a huddle of villages in the (supposed) age of Romulus.

_A reconstruction (above) and plan view (below) of the regal-era “Domus Regia” after Carrandini. Image: Atlas of Ancient Rome._ 

You don’t have to accept Carandini’s very literal identifications of structures (“the palace of Tarquinius Priscus”, even “[the hut of Romulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Romuli)” on the Palatine) to make use of the archaeological data that has emerged in the last 30–40 years. That structure under sts. Cosmas and Damian might not be a royal palace; perhaps its dating so close to the traditional founding of Rome is too convenient for confidence. Still, it clearly does date to the two or three centuries before the nominal expulsion of the Tarquins, and it is certainly something unusual — it’s as big as ten ordinary dwellings of the same era. It suggests a Rome capable of significant investments and displaying notable social stratification. The layers above it might not be confidently assigned to a series of particular named kings but they certainly indicate a large and growing complex on the spot which in historic times was known as the “king’s house.”

In a similar vein, the area next door in historic times was the [house of the Vestals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Vestals). This, too, shows layering going back to the 7th or 8th century BC — even if you don’t agree with Carandini that it contains the true, original sacred hearth. The depth of the layering suggests, at the very least, that the twin traditional institutions that defined archaic Roman self-image were physically continuous back to within a couple of generations for the mythical founding of the city. This is a good example of the qualification of data that’s “consistent with,” rather than proving, the traditional histories: we can’t archaeologically confirm the dramatic and mythological elements but the evidence shows a powerful Roman state, able to command very significant amounts of labor and ruled by an elite with definitively Etruscan tastes during the two and a half centuries traditionally assigned to the legendary kings.
