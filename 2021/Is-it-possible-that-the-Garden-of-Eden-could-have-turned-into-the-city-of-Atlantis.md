Atlantis is not in Europe or Africa (“Libya” as the Greeks would have called it) — Plato puts it beyond the pillars of Hercules, ie. the strait of Gibraltar.

Eden , on the other hand, is the source of four rivers: two of whom are the Tigris and the Euphrates. So it has to be in Eurasia.

> 10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

> 11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

> 12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.

> 13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

> 14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
