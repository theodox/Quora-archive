# Israel was poor, but its kings were rich. Jerusalem is depicted as large, well-defended, and with a massive and ornate Jewish temple rising above it. Where did the money for all this come from?

The easy answer is [balsam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balsam), which was a [tremendously sought-after aromatic in the Hellenistic and Roman eras](https://people.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/Shokel/050120_Balsam.html). In a [scent-obsessed world](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-Roman-thing-ever/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=30ac9386&srid=zLvM) (one which, let us recall, was a bit short on both indoor plumbing and non-animal forms of transportation) balsam was an incredibly lucrative monopoly. The Hasmoneans had[ balsam plantations in the vicinity of modern Ein Gedi](https://www.ft.com/content/24347478-3e34-11e2-91cb-00144feabdc0) which brought in a lot of cash. When Pompey conquered Judaea in 63 BCE his triumphal procession included balsam shrubs. When Marc Antony was based in Egypt he handed king Herod’s balsam plantations to Cleopatra as a lavish gift.

You can get some idea of how profitable they were from the fact that Herod leased them back from Cleopatra at 200 talents per year, something like the salaries two Roman legions. Balsam resin sold for twice its weight in silver; even the excess cuttings from the balsam gardens — recycled to make cheaper perfumes — brought in about 800,000 sesterces, the equivalent of about 3200 days worth of skilled labor.
