Good answers all!

Prometheus also has some elements of the 'trickster' in his background (teaching humans to sacrifice the fat and bones to the gods, since that smelled nicer but left the real meat for the worshipers, for example). And as [Sam Eilertsen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Sam-Eilertsen) points out plenty of the Greek gods were not exactly renowned for being straightforward. 

Athena is closely associated with stratagems and deceptions; mythologically, she is the daugther of Zeus and _[Metis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metis_%28mythology%29)_ _,_  which is incorrectly translated as 'wisdom' but is really 'cleverness' or 'slyness' of the kind that Odysseus is famous for.
