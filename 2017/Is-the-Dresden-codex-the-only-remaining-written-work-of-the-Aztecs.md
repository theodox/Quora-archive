As [Matt Riggsby](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matt-Riggsby) points out, no. Thereâ€™s a pretty good list here [Colonial and Aztec Codices](http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/mexcodex/aztec.htm). Many of these are authentically Aztec but post-conquest: the most famous one is the [Florentine Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentine_Codex), which was edited by a Spanish priest but is written in Nahuatl as well as Spanish and was illustrated by Aztec artisans. There are several pre-conquest ones as well, like the [Codex Borbonicus](http://www.famsi.org/research/graz/borbonicus/thumbs_0.html) and the [Codex Borgia](http://www.famsi.org/research/graz/borgia/thumbs_0.html).
