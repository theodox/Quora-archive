I'm pretty sure that number is bogus. The figure cited comes from what looks like a misreading of a single, unatttributed sentence in a 1980's computer magazine, which quotes $7 billion but somehow appears in the table in the linked page as '20-35 billion estimated'. It's way off .

A more usual number for the size of the industry in the early 80's is closer to 3 billion for US home consoles, another 3 for US arcades, and 4-5 billion for Japan (see [North American video game crash of 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_video_game_crash_of_1983) or [The Great Video Game Crash](http://thedoteaters.com/?bitstory=the-great-video-game-crash) or [1983 in video gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_in_video_gaming)
) 
I'm pretty dubious about the charts on that site as as well: I don't know the sales figures for sure but the years 2008-2012 were not generally boom times in the Japanese industry (which struggled pretty hard to adapt to the content demands of PS3/XB360 era consoles) -- the graph implies that 2008/9 was something like twice as big in revenue terms as 2006/7 or 2010/11 -- I don't remember anything going on that would explain a spike like that. I'd guess somebody screwed up their spreadsheet somehow.
