The name comes from the notorious Roman nobleman, [Lucius Sergius Catilina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catiline) — “Catiline” is the common English version of his family name.

Catiline was an aristocrat, but also an infamous adventurer. Besides the conspiracy which took his name, he was indicted for bribery, brought to trial for seducing a [Vestal Virgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestal_Virgin), tried (though acquitted) for a grisly political assassination — he was even accused of murdering his own first wife and child, though that was never brought to trial.

In the heated political atmosphere of 1st century BC Rome, outrageous slanders were very common; Catiline may not have been quite as outrageous as that track record makes him appear. However he was increasingly desperate: being a blue-blooded patrician did not mean Catiline was rich, and his legal misadventures cost him a fortune (in bribes to jurors, according to his enemies).

In the year 64 BC, Catiline tried to restore his fortune by running for the consul, the highest office of the Roman state. He had some influential friends (including, importantly, Julius Caesar) but his reputation was tainted and he lacked the deep pockets to fund a winning campaign. He lost soundly, and was left bankrupt — like many Roman politicians he borrowed money to campaign, expecting to make up the costs from the perks of office. Having failed to win he faced personal and political ruin.

Desperate, he decided that he would take by force what he could not win at the ballot box. He collected a band of supporters including other political also-rans, social radicals, and veterans who wanted support from the Roman state.

Rome in the mid-60s’ BC was politically fragile — political power and money were concentrated in few hands, but the traditional system of patronage which helped to redistribute wealth was breaking down and Roman society was atomizing. The peasants in the countryside were losing their land, the political class was losing the ability to compromise, and the streets were becoming increasingly violent. The army was increasingly willing to follow ambitious generals instead of the legitimate government. So, Catiline had at least some reason for thinking he could make himself master of the Roman state, as Julius Caesar would show 13 years later.

In the summer and early fall of 63 BC, the plot began to take shape. One of Catiline’s supporters began raising troops in Etruria, north of Rome, while Catiline registered for another run at the consulship, hoping he could possibly retrieve his fortunes without a coup. However Catiline lost again, setting the stage for an uprising.

In late October, letters from the conspirators fell into the hands of a few important Romans, in particular [Marcus Licinius Crassus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Licinius_Crassus), the richest man in Rome. These were turned over to the sitting consul, the famous orator [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero), who had an intense dislike for radicals of all kinds and for Catiline in particular. Cicero began loudly denouncing Catiline to anyone who would listen and demanding a [Senatus consultum ultimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senatus_consultum_ultimum), an emergency decree which granted the consuls broad powers in a crisis

At first, this was met with a lot of skepticism — many people, particularly on the populist side of Roman politics, thought this was just fearmongering or political name-calling. There were rumors of violence in the countryside, but the news was slow to arrive and confusing.

On the morning of November 7th, plotters planned to assassinate Cicero. However the plan was betrayed: The mistress of one of Catiline’s conspirators wanted to leave her lover, who (like Catiline) was a penniless ex-politician. He, however, told he that soon his money troubles would be over — thanks to Catiline. The mistress was a friend of Cicero’s wife, and warned the consul who avoided the attack.

Despite all that was going on, Cicero could not simply arrest Catiline: Rome had no full-time police. Instead he delivered a [series of public denunciations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catiline_Orations), dreaded by Latin students for the last two thousand years. Catiline fled the city to join the rebels in the countryside on November 8th.

Shortly thereafter another aspect of the plot was uncovered: one of Catiline’s lieutenants tried to bribe an embassy from the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe, to attack Rome in support of the rising. The ambassadors, however, denounced the traitor to the Senate. Several of Catiline’s associates were now rounded up and arrested.

The Senate debated what to do with the captives. Cicero and the majority were in favor of a drastic punishment: execution, a penalty which was almost impossible to impose on a Roman citizen legally. Cicero (and the future aristocratic spokesman, Cato) argued that a harsh penalty would break the back of the rebellion. Populists, led by Julius Caesar, argued for a more traditional legal process. However the combination of fear and war-fever won the day and the conspirators were executed on December 5.

When the news reached the rebel army in the countryside, desertions began almost at once. At the same time the government forces were finally began to push back against the rebels. However in Rome the populist party was beginning to make political capital out of the executions. Cicero was denied an official farewell address on the grounds that he had executed Roman citizens without trial. Riots broke out over a proposal to recall Pompey to finally defeat Catiline’s army.

However events on the battlefield outstripped politics. In mid-January of 62 BC, Catiline’s army was caught between two government forces and destroyed in the foothils of the Alps. The arch-conspirator and his closest allies died on the battlefield, ending the threat once and for all.

The conspiracy was not, by itself, an existential threat to Rome — at least, not unless the rumors that the plotters planned to set fire to the city to cover their attack were true.

However, it was the forerunner of a violent turn in Roman politics. Within three years Pompey, Crassus and Caesar [would have begun to rule the city as if it were a private partnership](https://www.ancient.eu/First_Triumvirate/). Cicero would be hounded out of the city by outraged populists, driven into exile in Greece until his main opponent — the rabble-rouser [Clodius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Clodius_Pulcher) — was himself murdered in a street brawl by a rival political gang. Street violence and civil war became regular features of Roman politics. Less than a decade and a half after Catiline tried and failed, Caesar (whom many believed was a silent partner in Catiline’s conspiracy) would destroy the Republic once and for all.
