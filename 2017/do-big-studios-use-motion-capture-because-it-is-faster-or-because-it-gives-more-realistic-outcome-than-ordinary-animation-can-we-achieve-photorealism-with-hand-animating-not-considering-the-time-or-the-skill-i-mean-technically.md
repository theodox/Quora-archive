# Do big studios use motion capture because it is faster or because it gives more realistic outcome than ordinary animation? Can we achieve photorealism with hand animating (not considering the time or the skill I mean technically)?

Generally mocap and hand animation are used for different things nowadays. There are individual exceptions for different aesthetic choices, but on the whole mocap dominates in areas where realistic human movement is needed and hand animation is more important in areas where gameplay needs are paramount.

Economics does factor in to both of those choices. Animator time is expensive, and realistic hand animation doubly so. If you really want the physicality of a person shifting their weight, gesturing with realistic weight in their hands, and making characteristic movements of the head it will take an animator days to achieve what a mocap actor can do in minutes. On the other hand, if you want to mocap a fast, violent or extreme action you can’t just suit up a pudgy out-of-shape game dev and let them go: you need a trained stuntperson, safety equipment, and often custom-made props. So studios tend to rely on mocap more for animations that are close to the realities of everyday life, and on hand animation for the more extreme (or more dangerous) sequences.

A lot of studios use both techniques. Frequently an ingame animation involves both: an animator might start with mocap as reference but rework it meet gameplay requirements, or they might use animation blending to add some of the nice high frequency detail from mocap to an animation that is otherwise done by hand.

[This article ](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132203/postmortem_naughty_dogs_.php)is a bit old, but it gives some insight into the mix hand-and-mocapped pipeline for the Uncharted series; there’s more in this audio recording of [Jeremy Lai-Yates’ 2008 GDC talk](https://archive.org/details/GDC2008Yates).

To answer the last question: yes, a talented animator can produce results that ordinary people could not distinguish from motion capture. But it would be a huge amount of work to get results you can get more cheaply through mechanical means: you can [get a painter to do something this realistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Close):

But once you’ve made the point that it’s possible… why would you?
