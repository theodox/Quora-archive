Almost uniquely, we have about as close to a literal answer for how Augustus tried to justify himself as one could wish for.

The _[Res Gestae Divi Augusti](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/Introduction*.html)_ is Augustus’ first-hand political testament. It was originally composed as a kind of posthumous state-of-the-union address, deposited along with his will to be presented publicly after his death. The prime copy was inscribed on bronze tablets at Rome, but many duplicates were placed on display in temples of the imperial cult across the empire. By a great stroke of good luck, one substantially intact copy survived into modern times in Ankara, Turkey, giving us a nearly complete glimpse of what Augustus thought his accomplishments really were.

The text is interesting is not a piece of stirring rhetoric, nor is it particularly literary — it’s about on the same plane as the stuffier parts of CSPAN. Or perhaps it’s more accurate to think of it as an over-achiever’s resume: a bullet pointed list of achievements:

> __Experience:__ 

> Accomplished civil war victor with excellent administrative abilities and a passion for Roman tradition.

> __Key Achievements__ 

> Two triumphs with ovations

> Three curule triumphs

> Acclaimed “imperator” 21 times

> 10 years triumvir for constitutional restoration

> First consulate at age 19, consul 12 more times

> 37 years of tribunician powers

… and so on, and so on.

This litany of traditional aristocratic kudos is precisely the “justification” Augustus wanted to present. It’s an endless succession of offices, achievements, and public benefactions, any one of which would have marked the pinnacle of an ordinary Roman aristocrat’s career — the greatest list of plaudits any Roman aristocrat had ever achieved. It covers all of the traditional aristocratic bases: success on the battlefield, political offices held, gifts to the public and to the gods, and even that most aristocratic activity of all: refusing ‘un-Roman’ honors and living like a regular Senator:

> when the Senate and the Roman people unanimously agreed that I should be elected overseer of laws and morals, without a colleague and with the fullest power, I refused to accept any power offered me which was contrary to the traditions of our ancestors.

You could probably have a field day trying to deconstruct the text (the complete version is available in the link above). Is there some sly self-conscious game in bragging that you were a consul at 19 but bragging a few paragraphs later that you refused offices “contrary to the traditions of our ancestors” ? After all, those same ancestors set the legal age for consuls at 42.

However I personally don’t feel Augustus is being coy.

The _Res Gestae_  retains his Republican veneer down to the end, even in the stuffiness of its language. Though the his political structure was a monarchy in all but name, his psychology remained eminently old fashioned. Above all, he perfectly embodied the traditional competitive mindset of Republican aristocracy and he knew that his closing statement was all the more powerful because it was made of hard, countable _facts_  and not mere flourishes of language. He offers no abstractions about the public good, no arguments for the efficiency of a central administration, and no claims of special divine dispensation: just the scoresheet of the greatest player who ever played the game.
