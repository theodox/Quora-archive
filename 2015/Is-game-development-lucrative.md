[James Liu](https://www.quora.com/profile/James-Liu-20)'s answer covers the mobile scene well. If anything, it's probably too optimistic.

In the console space, the economics are quite different and in some ways better. Console games are much larger enterprises: even a smallish game will have a budget in the neighborhood of $8 million, while the really big games -- the ones that make the regular media -- can be ten or even twenty times as much. This naturally limits the competition considerably. Occasionally an indie title will get featured as well, but ultimately the console companies keep out many more titles than the IOS and android marketplaces.

The up side of this limited market is that it's much less competitive. The down side is that that you need several million bucks to get started. This is one reason big AAA games tend to be less innovative: risk aversion and big budgets go hand in hand. 

The main problem for console devs is that the platform holders set the prices: Sony, MS and Nintendo decide how much you can charge for a 'box' (even if there's no physical box) and they are more interested in getting people to buy their consoles rather than enriching developers. The $60 unit price of a console game today is less, in inflation adjusted terms, than the $50 price of a console game in 2001 and way less than a 90's catridge game like Mario 64, which would be $75 in today's dollars (see [Steve Theodore's answer to We have bought an Xbox game up to 50 dollars. Isn't it too much?](https://www.quora.com/We-have-bought-an-Xbox-game-up-to-50-dollars-Isnt-it-too-much/answer/Steve-Theodore)) They are also still figuring out how things like in-game purchases and DLC fit into their business model. So, budgets have ballooned but unit prices have not -- which explains why many mid-sized console devs disappeared between 2008 and 2013. 

In the PC space, there are two big hurdles.

Piracy drives prices through the floor. Easily 90% of the games played on PCs are not paid for. In most countries its basically not possible to make money selling games to players. Moreover, pirates in the aggregate make your life worse even without stealing from you: in addition to not paying for your game, many pirates are completely un-selfconscious about demanding tech support or filling up online forums with their complaints despite having stolen your work. 

The rise of both MMOs and free-to-play games are evolutionary responses to the impossibility of just selling copies of games. Microtransactions and subscriptions are harder to rip off -- but they have costs of their own, both in customer service and transaction costs -- which make them less profitable. Plus many genres don't lend themselves easily to those kinds of business. 

PCs also suffer from tech support costs: the incredible diversity of PC operating systems and hardware imposes big costs on developers who have to test against a bewildering variety of setups. At least Steam simplifies distribution -- but now that it's pretty much the only way people buy PC games, it's starting to see rapid price erosion similar to what happened in the App stores. Plus, frequent sales are gradually diminishing player's expectations on price: why pay $50 at launch when you know it will be $25 in a few months? Or $10 in a year? The only bright side there is that the usual pirate BS about "I don't want to waste my precious money on your game before I know I like it" is even more obviously dishonest when the game cost less than a trip to McDonalds.
