There's two very different answers here. 

If you take 'patricians' to mean 'the traditional Roman nobility' -- the collection of clans that gave us Caesar, Brutus and so forth -- it wasn't the barbarians who wiped them out. It was the Romans. The old Senatorial elite was decimated in the bloody last generation of the Republic and the civil wars of the early Empire: the famous names begin dropping out even before Augustus comes to power. The repeated purges under the various insecure emperors of the first and second century (Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Domitian and so on) thinned the ranks even further. 

Undoubtedly some of those families survived physically -- but their social status, wealth, and political importance rendered them even less relevant than the modern European nobility. A related reason was that the Romans didn't practice primogeniture: each family spread its inheritance among its male (and to some degree female) heirs. This meant that old family fortunes and estates were diluted over time. The emperors distrusted aristocrats as possible rivals, so they didn't give them the lucrative governmental or military posts they'd need to continue to build their fortunes. 

More importantly the bad years of the 3rd century -- when civilian government essentially collapsed for more than 50 years -- finally killed off any last nostalgic afterglow of the Republic.  

From Commodus to Constantine, the only power that mattered was military power or an administrative position in the military-industrial complex.. The nobility of the later empire were ultimately descended from the generals and bureaucrats of the age of Diocletian and Constantine. They got their lands and titles for successful service (or because they took them at swordpoint) and not because of inherited privilege. To some decree they tried to imitate the manners and lifestyle of their Republican predecessors -- but only somewhat. The disappearance of the old ruling elite has a lot to do with the changes in art and cultural style which are so obvious during this period.

 _Late Roman statues like this reflect the tastes of a new and very different Roman nobility_ 

Which leads to the second half of the answer. 

This new nobility, which grew up under the Dominate and was always a nobility of highly-placed government apparatchiks, _did_ survive long after the fall of Rome. Charlemagne and his father, for example, were _patricii Romani_  long before Charlemagne became emperor; and many other notables of the 5th through the 9th centuries retained the same title, because the new barbarian rulers of Europe were deeply intertwined with the old Roman system.

_Charlemagne in his role as Imperator Augustus and Roman patrician, 800._ 

The barbarian kings who proliferated in the west needed administrators, and they used Romans with the political savvy, legal experience and administrative know-how to keep society from collapsing: men like [Boethius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boethius) and [Symmachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Aurelius_Memmius_Symmachus) who could negotiate the complexities of what was still a fundamentally 'Roman' society with a new, barbarian ruling class. There was a lot of intermarriage between the barbarians and the Roman elite -- made easier by the fact that many of those 'Roman nobles' had been barbarians themselves just a few generations before: the emperors Justin and Justinian, for example, were literally peasants who rose through the ranks; Emperor Theodosius married his niece to [Stilicho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho), a half-Vandal Roman general; [Galla Placidia, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galla_Placidia)Theodosius' daughter, married [Ataulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataulf) the Goth -- who had been a Gothic commander during the sack of Rome in 410. Much later the German [Otto II ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor)married a "Roman" Byzantine princess. The 'new nobility', unlike the older patrician variety, was much more willing to drop its social prejudices in order to survive. 

Another important destination for many Late-Roman nobles was the church. The church was both a repository of culture (in a time when war and endemic poverty threatened the survival of the Roman literary tradition) and, to some degree, a refuge from the cut-throat politics of the court and the battlefield. One of the reasons medieval monarchs depended so heavily on the Church was that it became such a magnet for the educated classes and was the best place to find bureaucrats and lawyers.
