They’re both fine. As the other answers note, in Latin it’s the word forms, rather than the word order, which conveys grammatical role. Latin split between subject-object-verb and subject-verb-object order almost equally for most uses, but for simple descriptive assertions they usually go subject-adjective-verb, so _vir parvus est_ is more likely if not more “correct”.

And when the only verb is _sum_  or _est_ it’s often left out — so _vir parvus_  would be enough in conversation.
