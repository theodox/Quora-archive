There was no official name.

Informally it would be the _religio romana_ or simply the _mos maiorum,_ “the customs of our ancestors”. If you were focusing on the supernatural aspects (which wasn’t necessarily how most Romans would approach it) it would be _cultus,_ “worship” or _cultus deorum,_ “the worship of the gods” — though in that case there would be nothing necessarily Roman about it.

There were a few official groupings with recognized titles. Mostly these were known as _collegia_  or _sodalitates_ , and they were among the very few legally permissible private associations under Roman law. The most famous of these were the [Vestal virgins](https://www.ancient.eu/Vestal_Virgin/) and the [college of augurs](http://www.classics.upenn.edu/myth/php/tools/dictionary.php?method=did&regexp=1493&setcard=0&link=0&media=0). Generally these groups were responsible for a particular rite or shrine. In general however these were not ‘clergy’ in the modern sense: these positions were at part-time jobs with a certain degree of public prestige. To be a member of a Roman priestly college was more like being the grand marshal of you town Fourth of July parade than like being a rabbi or minister.
