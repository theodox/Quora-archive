In the book of Esther, it’s [Vashti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vashti).

If the biblical Ahasuerus is identified as Xerxes, it’s an outside chance that Vashti could be identified as [Amestris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amestris), the only named wife of Xerxes. If we can believe Herodotus, she was a tough character who took gruesome personal vengeance on her court rivals. However the Persian kings practiced polygamy so even if the Ahasuerus is Xerxes, there’s no guarantee that Vashti is Amestris. In extra-biblical Jewish tradition, Vashti was said to be a descendant of Nebuchudnezzar, the Babylonian king who deported the Jews to Mesopotamia: that detail doesn’t show up in Greek sources about Amestris.
