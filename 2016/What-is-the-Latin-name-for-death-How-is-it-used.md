_mors_ is the unvarnished name. In poetic contexts you can uses it as a kind of personification (like the difference between _death_ in regular English and _Death_  in Terry Pratchett). Like all Latin nouns the form of the word changes depending on how it works in a sentence:

As a subject: ___mors___ _vincit omnia,_ "death conquers all"

As an owner or possessor: _t_ _imor_ ___mortis___ _,_ "fear of death"

As the object of a sentence: _vita aliud nihil quam ad_ ___mortem___ _iter._ "life is nothing but a path to death".

(Since the Romans didn't use our habit of capitalizing proper names there' no way to really tell when they just mean the physical phenomenon and when the personified idea of "Death" except by context).

The actual Roman gods of death are almost never addressed by name. _Pluto_  is the Roman equivalent of Hades, however his name isn't a proper name but a nickname, "the wealthy one" (because he owns all the treasures of the underworld". _Orcus_ is sometimes used interchangeably with Pluto but sometimes seems to be a different mythological figure: he tends to be used for the idea of punishment and  suffering in the afterlife. However the Romans didn't like mentioning even these nicknames out loud, tending to believe in the _speak of the Devil..._  principle.
