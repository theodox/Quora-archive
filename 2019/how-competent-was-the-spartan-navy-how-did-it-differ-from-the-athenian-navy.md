Most of the time Sparta was a third-rate naval power. The Spartans were primarily concerned first with keeping a firm grasp on their helots and secondly on keeping their local rivals in check. Overseas empire building was not their typical pattern. Sparta’s days as a serious naval power can be dated with laconic precision: the dozen years from 406 to 394 BC.

The history of the Peloponnesian war bears this out. The early years of the war at sea were humiliating for the Spartans and their allies, particularly the Corinthians. Early in the war the Athenian admiral [Phormio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phormio), with just 20 ships, defeated two Peloponessian fleets of 47 and and 77 ships respectively. The first significant Spartan victory at sea was at [Eretria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Eretria) in 411, _20 years_  into the conflict. Eretria was something of a fluke, too: the Athenian fleet was refitting in harbor when its condition was betrayed to a lurking Spartan force by sympathizers in the city.

The Persians — who were nervous that the Athenians might actually succeed in uniting Greece and then turn their sights eastward — showered the Spartans with money, enabling them to build a large fleet. This they staffed mostly with professional mercenary sailors — including, it should be said, plenty of veterans of the Athenian fleet. While the Athenians relied on citizen rowers for the most part, they could and did pay for professionals as well.

With Persian money, the Spartans were able to recruit veteran rowers and build ships. The Persians also allowed the Spartans to build their new fleet at Ephesus, under the protection of the Persian army. Not only did the new fleet pose a threat, the higher pay offered by the Spartans created morale problems for the Athenians as well.

The newly enlarged fleet was still tentative — the rowers had to practice in the harbor or Ephesus or even on land, and as long as the Athenian admiral Alcibiades was on hand the Spartans would not come out to fight. However when Alcibiades was away on business his second in command, Antiochus, deliberately provoked a battle in defiance of his orders, leading to a legitimate Spartan victory at at [Notion ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Notium)in 406.

When the Athenian assembly dismissed Alcibiades, the initiative passed to the Spartans, who conquered a number of Athens’ island possessions. But even here, the Spartans were not eager for a full confrontation — in the last campaign the Athenians repeatedly tried to lure the Spartans into an open fight, but the Spartans refused to leave their bases. The naval war ended not with a clash of arms but due to Athenian frustration: after five days trying and failing to lure the Spartans out, the Athenians themselves were caught unprepared and destroyed while foraging for food and water on the beach at [Aegospotami.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aegospotami) Bereft of its fleet — and the control of the sea-lanes vital to feeding the city — Athens surrendered within a year.

The Persian alliance which created the Spartan navy frayed quickly. Spartan admiral Lysander — the architect of the Persian alliance and the godfather of the new fleet — took to piracy and raids in Persian waters. By 396 — the Spartans were at war with Persia. The Persians bankrolled a new fleet, this time under the command of the Athenian [Conon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conon), the loser at Aegospotami. This new armada (manned by a mix of Athenian exiles, Cypriots, Phoenicians and Egyptians) defeated the Spartans at [Cnidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cnidus) in 394, ending the short heyday of Spartan naval power forever.
