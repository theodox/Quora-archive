# If Josephus wrote Wars of the Jews in Aramaic first, and the Greek version in 75CE, after the war ended in 73 CE, when do scholars think he actually wrote the Aramaic version? How could he write the first version if the war hadn't even finished?

The date of 75 is ultimately a modern guess at the date of the publication. This offers a good example of how ancient historians try to pin down dates for things which don’t come with timestamps.

The latest dateable events in the book are the siege of Masada (73 or possibly 74), the defeat of guerilla activities in Cyrenaica (same), and Josephus’ vindication when accused of anti-Roman agitation (74 or 75, in Rome). This is what old-fashioned historians would call the _terminus post quem_ , or “point after which” — 75 is the earliest date the Greek text could have been published, but not necessarily the year it actually appeared.

In his [autobiography](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/autobiog.html), written 20 years later, Josephus says this about his work:

> I offered my books to the Emperors themselves, when the facts were almost under men’s eyes. For I was conscious to my self that I had observed the truth of the facts: and as I expected to have their attestation to them, so I was not deceived in such expectation. Moreover, I immediately presented my history to many other persons, some of whom were concerned in the war; as was King Agrippa, and some of his kindred. Now the Emperor Titus was so desirous that the knowledge of these affairs should be taken from these books alone, that he subscribed his own hand to them, and ordered that they should be published.

Vespasian died in 79, so that’s close to the latest year in which it could have been published (the so-called “_terminus ante quem”)._ 

Since Josephus says, somewhat casually, that the publication of the _Jewish War_ was written 20 years earlier, the date of the _Jewish War_  really depends on the date of the autobiography. If you assume the autobiography was always included in his larger [Antiquities of the Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquities_of_the_Jews) (more or less securely dated to 94) then the date becomes 74 or 75. However, the autobiography also assumes the death of Josephus’ friend and fellow-collaborator [Herod Agrippa II](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/herod-agrippa-ii/) — which is dated to the third year of Trajan, that is, to 100. That pushes the publication forward to around 80. The manuscripts we have usually combine the autobiography and the _Antiquities_  into one volume there’s no way to know if they were actually released together. Thus, we’re still stuck with roughly the same range of possible dates from ~ 75 to ~ 80.

As for the original in Josephus “native tongue” (probably Aramaic, not Hebrew) — that was probably a somewhat different book and might have been some years earlier than our Greek text. It was very deliberately directed to Jewish communities abroad. In our version he says:

> I have proposed to myself, for the sake of such as live under the government of the Romans, to translate those books into the Greek tongue, which I formerly composed in the language of our country, and sent to the Upper Barbarians

“Upper barbarians” is a characteristically awkward Josephan way of referring to the Jews of Mesopotamia — a large and influential community within the rival Parthian empire, whose attitude was of intense interest to the Romans, especially to Vespasian and Titus, Josephus’s captors-cum-patrons. Some of these foreign Jews had fought to defend Jerusalem, and the Mesopotamian communities would eventually go on to support to several subsequent Jewish revolts against Rome into the second century. It made eminent sense for the Romans to sponsor Josephus’ account — which generally blames the war on Jewish radicals and portrays the Romans as reluctant destroyers — as a way of conciliating foreign Jewish opinion in a traumatic time.

Thus it’s entirely possible that the Aramaic version was even a couple of years earlier, at a time when foreign Jews were still processing the destruction of Jerusalem. Possibly it was even written before the siege of Masada.

Only the seventh and final book of the Greek version covers events after the end of the main military campaign — and it covers many issues which were vital to Josephus’s friends in the Flavian dynasty and to himself personally but not necessarily of burning interest to the Jews of Babylonia. At the time of Masada Josephus was living in Rome under the watchful eye of Vespasian. He was embroiled in a series of low-grade court intrigues, particularly among other emigre Jews at Rome — he survived then all, but those conflicts might have encouraged him to secure his own position by issuing a Greek version of his book which would circulate around the court, unlike his foreign-oriented Aramaic text.
