There are something between 85 and 100 or so, assuming you stop counting with the fall of the western empire in 476.

Why so vague?

The problem is that the [Roman succession was extremely irregular.](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires) Only about a quarter of Roman emperors died of natural causes. In the bad years from 235 to 285 the average emperor reigned about two years. It was a rough job. The sudden death of an emperor might lead to two or three or even four rivals proclaiming themselves the next in line, followed by a war or perhaps a little poisoning to move things along. Most of the third century was one long multi-way civil war (at one point the empire was split into 3 — for a couple of years the most powerful ruler in the Roman world was actually Queen [Zenobia of Palmyra](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-Zenobia/answer/Steve-Theodore)).

So, getting to a more exact number requires paragraph upon paragraph of special casing to explain exactly why so-and-so is an emperor but somebody else is a ‘usurper’ or ‘rebel’.

The longest (and thus most inclusive) list I’ve found is this one: [List of Rulers of the Roman Empire](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/roru/hd_roru.htm) but I’m not sure it’s complete; like most lists it does count 4 names for the year 69, known as “the [Year of the Four Emperors](http://www.unrv.com/early-empire/year-four-emperors.php)” — but like most lists it omits the _fifth_ claimaint of that year, [Julius Sabinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Sabinus).

This graphic misses many less well-known claimants, but it gives you some good idea of the ups and downs of emperorship:
