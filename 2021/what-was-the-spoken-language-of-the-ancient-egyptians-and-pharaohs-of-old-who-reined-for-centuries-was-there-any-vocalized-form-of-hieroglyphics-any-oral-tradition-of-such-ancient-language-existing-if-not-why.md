# What was the spoken language of the ancient Egyptians and Pharaohs of old who reined for centuries? Was there any vocalized form of hieroglyphics? Any oral tradition of such ancient language existing? If not, why?

The modern descendant of the ancient Egyptian language is [Coptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language), which survives as the liturgical language of the Coptic church in Egypt — about 10% of the country’s population. You can hear it any Sunday in a Coptic church service:



Coptic is/was the last stage in the 5,000 year evolution of Egyptian languages. We usually divide the long history of Egyptian into five periods: [Old Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_language#Old_Egyptian) (before around 2100 BC), [Middle Egyptian](https://isaw.nyu.edu/library/blog/getting-started-with-middle-egyptian) (~2100–1500 BC), [Late Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Egyptian_language) (~1500 - 700 BC), [Demotic ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian))(~700 BC - 400 AD) and finally Coptic. While they are all related they represent thousands of years of evolution and are not interchangeable.

Most hieroglyphics are written in Middle Egyptian: in very conservative Egypt, scholars and priests continued to use Middle Egyptian for official inscriptions long after the language of daily life had changed.
