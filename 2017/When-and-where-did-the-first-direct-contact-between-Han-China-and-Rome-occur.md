“Direct contact” isn’t quite the right word. Depending on how you choose to count, it was either a bunch of Roman jugglers in 97, or a self-appointed goodwill ambassador with a load of cheap souvenirs in 166, although maybe it was a Chinese representative sometime in the first decade of the first century.

There was never an unproblematic, regular route for diplomatic communications between China and Rome. The intermediates along the way (particularly the Parthians and Sassanians) had a powerful interest in maintaining their monopoly on the lucrative trade between east and west, so they went out of their way to prevent any developments that would erode their position. So the Rome-China relationship, such as it was, was never a military-political competition; the distances involved were so great, and the overland communications so poor, that actual military cooperation was impossible.

__Chinese records__ 

We have better records from the Chinese than the Roman side — but they definitely indicate that the Chinese didn’t even really grasp this difference between the Roman province of Syria and the Roman Empire as a whole; there are pretty good descriptions of Roman Syria and at least a mention of Alexandria — but there’s not even a clear example of a Chinese effort to write the name “Rome”.

The classic Chinese records are collected in [China and the Roman Orient](https://archive.org/details/chinaandromanor01hirtgoog), along with a very detailed discussion of how to map the Chinese names onto western places. The relevant portion (repeated down the centuries in many variations) is this:

> During the 9th year [of Yung-yuan, 97 C.E.] the barbarian tribes outside the frontier and the king of the country of Shan [Armenia], named Yung-yu-tiao, sent twofold interpreters, and was endowed with state jewels. Ho-ti [Emperor, 89-106 C.E.] conferred a golden seal with a purple ribbon, and the small chiefs were granted seals, ribbons, and money. During the 1st year of Yung-ning [120 C.E.] the king of the country of Shan, named Yung-yu-tiao, again sent an embassy who, being received to His Majesty's presence, offered musicians and jugglers. The latter could conjure, spit fire, bind and release their limbs without assistance, change the heads of cows and horses, and were clever at dancing with up to a thousand balls. They said themselves: "We are men from the west of the sea; the west of the sea is the same as Ta-ts'in [Roman Syria]. In the south-west of the country of Shan one passes through to Ta-ts'in."

A bit later the same text adds this story of some Parthian sailors discouraging the Chinese from trying the trip on their own:

> In the 9th year of Yung-yüan of Ho-ti [97 C.E.] the _tu-hu_  [governor] Pan Ch'ao sent Kan-ying as an ambassador to Ta-ts'in [Roman Syria], who arrived in T'iao-chih [Babylonia], on the coast of the great sea [Persian Gulf]. When about to take his passage across the sea, the sailors of the western frontier of Ar-hsi told Kan-ying: "The sea [Indian Ocean] is vast and great; with favorable winds it is possible to cross within three months---but if you meet slow winds, it may also take you two years. It is for this reason that those who go to sea take on board a supply of three years' provisions. There is something in the sea which is apt to make man home-sick, and several have thus lost their lives." When Kan-ying heard this, he stopped.

And finally, there’s an account of Roman envoys who showed up in China:

> [Roman] kings always desired to send embassies to Zhongguo [China], but the Ar-hsi wished to carry on trade with them in Han silks, and it is for this reason that they were cut off from communication. This lasted till the ninth year of the Yen-hsi period during the emperor Huan-ti's reign [166 C.E.] when the king of Ta-ts'in, An-tun [Marcus Aurelius Antoninus], sent an embassy who, from the frontier of Jih-nan [Annam] offered ivory, rhinoceros horns, and tortoise shell. From that time dates the direct intercourse with this country. The list of their tribute contained no jewels whatever, which fact throws doubt on the tradition.

The story — which gets repeated down the centuries in Chinese sources — doesn’t have a direct match on the Roman side. The fact that the envoys only brought gifts that could be purchased along the way, in Burma or India (the Romans wouldn’t send Rhino horns to China, having no domestic source!) has made many historians suspect this wasn’t an ‘embassy’ at all, but rather a Roman trader deciding on his own initiative to pose as a representative of Rome.

__Roman Records__ 

The only Roman record is a sentence in Florus ( around the time of Trajan) which indicates that Augustus, a century before, had received embassies from the Seres — that is, the Chinese — and the Indians. However it’s not very informative:

> For the Scythians and the Sarmatians sent ambassadors seeking friendship. Likewise the Seres and the Indians who live immediately beneath the sun. Though they gems and and pearls and elephants among other treasures they regarded nothing more impressive than their long journey of four years. Indeed their complexion proved that they came from beneath another sky.

This would put some kind of contact in the last years of Augustus, so probably in the first decade of the first century. However this may be another case of a self-appointed “ambassador,” since the envoys — if such they were — showed up with goods (elephants, gemstones, and pearls) from India, rather than China (though the four-year journey is rather longer than the fairly regular Indian Ocean trade of the times). Moreover the Chinese records definitely say that the abortive effort in 97, above was the first mission to the far west.

__TLDR;__ 

There are a few possible dates, but none of them is clearly and unambiguously official. The “relationship” was mostly notional, even though it was a economically important.
