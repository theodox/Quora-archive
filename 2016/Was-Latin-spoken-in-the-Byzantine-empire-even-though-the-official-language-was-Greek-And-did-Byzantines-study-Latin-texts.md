Latin was the 'official' language of the empire until reign of [Heraclius (reigned 610-641), ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclius)despite the fact that he himself seems to have come from a Latin-speaking background*. The Byzantines retained some knowledge of and use of Latin for several hundred years after, but it was essentially a 'foreign language'. Bits and pieces of Latin remained technical vocabulary (particularly in the military and the law).

For more details see [Were the medieval Byzantines familiar with the famous figures of Roman antiquity, like Cato the Elder, Scipio Africanus, or Cincinnatus?](https://www.quora.com/Were-the-medieval-Byzantines-familiar-with-the-famous-figures-of-Roman-antiquity-like-Cato-the-Elder-Scipio-Africanus-or-Cincinnatus) 

_* It's often asserted the Justinian was the last 'native Latin speaking' emperor. Heraclius' family were probably Armenians. The main reason for supposing he spoke Latin familiarly is that some (Latin) addresses to him during his reign presume familarity with Latin Roman history. The family may have been fluent in Latin simply by virtue of being tied to Roman society through the army, rather than civilian politics._
