Yes. This is the whole job of shaders, which are micro-programs inside the rendering engine that control the final appearance of rendered objects. Most shaders are efforts to create a pseudo-realistic result, modeling the behavior of light and various kinds of materials. However, shaders can do pretty much anything else too: cartoon-style flat shading, matrix -style text crawl effects, or just plain psychedelia. Textures are just one one of the many factors that a shader can use to create visual results, although they are one of the most common.

The best introduction to the huge range of what shaders can do is the website [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), which showcases the incredible variety of effects that are possible. Unfortunately Quora wonâ€™t run their samples inline inside and answer, but here are a few images to give you an idea of how varied the results can be (click on the links below to see the shaders running live in 3d):
