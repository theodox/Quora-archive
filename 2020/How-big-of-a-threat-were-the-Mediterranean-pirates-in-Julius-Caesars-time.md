In the _early_  part of Caesar’s life they were a tremendous threat. Caesar knew this first hand: as a young man[ he himself was captured and ransomed by pirates.](https://www.quora.com/Was-Julius-Caesar-really-captured-by-pirates/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=5d515bf7&srid=zLvM)

But Caesar was far from the only person to suffer from their hands. Nowhere within reach of the sea was safe during the pirate heyday (roughly 90–68 BC):

> the ships of the pirates numbered more than a thousand, and the cities captured by them four hundred. Besides, they attacked and plundered places of refuge and sanctuaries hitherto inviolate, such as those of Claros, Didyma, and Samothrace; the temple of Chthonian Earth at Hermione; that of Asclepius in Epidaurus; those of Poseidon at the Isthmus, at Taenarum, and at Calauria; those of Apollo at Actium and Leucas; and those of Hera at Samos, at Argos, and at Lacinium. They also offered strange sacrifices of their own at Olympus, and celebrated there certain secret rites, among which those of Mithras continue to the present time, having been first instituted by them.

During their heyday the pirates were major drivers of the Mediterranean slave trade: the monstrous slave market at Delos, their primary clearing-house, could handle ten thousand victims at a time.

__The scale of the problem__ 

You may recall — just as an illustration — how in the movie _Spartacus_  the slave-rebels tried to cut a deal with Cilician pirates to escape from Italy. The original sources put it a bit differently: his plan was evidently to transport around 2,000 soldiers across the straights to Sicily where he hoped to spread the revolt.

Nonetheless, two things stand out about this if you ponder for a moment. First, that the pirates had the logistical capacity to transport the equivalent of a Roman legion — that implies at several hundred ships, since a typical pirate galley in these days could carry fewer than 50 people in addition to its own crew. Second, this fleet is operating in Italian waters, on the direct route connecting Rome to the grain supplies of Sicily and North Africa, on which the city was rapidly becoming dependent. The notorious pirate havens were located in Cilicia, near what today is the border between Turkey and Syria. So this enormous fleet has the ability to operate hundreds of miles away from its home bases.

This is, essentially, a naval power rather than a criminal gang. The pirates repeatedly defeated naval squadrons sent out to combat them In fact they destroyed two different Roman fleets in daring raids on Roman harbors in Italy itself. Here’s Cicero talking to a Roman audience after the final defeat of the pirates:

> Need I mention, how Cnidus, and Colophon, and Samos, most noble cities, and others too in countless numbers, were taken by them, when you know that your own harbours, and those harbours too from which you derive, as it were, your very life and breath, were in the power of the pirates? Are you ignorant that the harbour of Caieta, that illustrious harbour, when full of ships, was plundered by the pirates under the very eyes of the praetor? and that from Misenum, the children of the very man who had before that waged war against the pirates in that place, were carried off by the pirates? For why should I complain of the disaster of Ostia, and of that stain and blot on the republic, when almost under your very eyes, that fleet which was under the command of a Roman consul was taken and destroyed by the pirates?

[On Pompey’s command, 35](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0019%3Atext%3DMan.%3Achapter%3D12%3Asection%3D35)

__The end of the pirate era__ 

The infamous peak of piratical power was Cicero’s final lament: the destruction of the Roman grain fleet and its naval escort at Ostia, only 20 miles from Rome itself.

Food prices spiked and the terrified populace demanded immediate action. In response, the Romans appointed [Pompey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey) to a [completely unprecedented command in 68 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Gabinia_de_piratis_persequendis). He was given the most powerful command in Roman history to date: a fleet of 270 ships, 120,000 soldiers, and overriding authority over every inch of Roman and allied territory within 50 miles of the sea.

Pompey’s campaign was a remarkable example of his often underrated powers as a leader. His martial reputation tends to suffer because he lacked Caesar’s battlefield flair, but Pompey was a master of operational warfare. He quickly organized a vast grid system which isolated the various pirate havens. While his main fleet steadily swept the main sea-lanes his armies denied the pirates places to land and refit. He cut a series of deals with various pirate factions, using the offer of merciful treatment to find out the locations of other pirate bases. All told, he swept the seas of pirates in just three months: an astonishing outcome which no Mediterranean power had ever contemplated before. The sea lanes of the Mediterranean would be largely safe for most of the next half-millennium. Small-scale piracy, like banditry, was never completely eliminated — but until the fall of the Roman empire in the west Pompey’s campaign put an end to specter of pirate flotillas sacking entire cities.

Caesar had, of course, his own private anti-pirate adventure. He personally recruited and led a force which attacked the pirate’s nest where he had once been held captive. At least, that’s what our only source tells us. However, it’s not impossible that the story as we read it was embellished later as a way to give him a small part in the great achievement of Pompey, his most important rival.

_This is probably the only existing portrait of a Cilician pirate._ _[Tarcondimotus I](http://dbpedia.org/page/Tarcondimotus_I)_ _ended his days as a Roman client king but he did not inherit a throne: he’s believed to have become a local Roman proxy after submitting to Pompey. Cicero liked him and thought him a most loyal and dependable Roman ally. Despite his respectable later career, however, it’s quite likely his got his start as a corsair.
