She was Macedonian (whether that's 'Greek' is a modern-day political question -- she was from the same ethnic group as Alexander the Great. 

Here's her family tree in great detail, going back to Ptolemy -- the Macedonian general who ruled Egypt for Alexander and then in his own right after Alexander's death.

the famous Cleopatra is Cleopatra VII down at the bottom. If you look at the tree you'll notice several brother-sister marriages: The Ptolemies borrowed that Egyptian custom to keep the crown in the family. 

A few people think that maybe [she had an ethnic Egyptian female ancestor](http://blog.oup.com/2010/12/cleopatra-2/) but that's an outlier view: it assumes that Cleopatra's grandmother was not Berenice III but an unnamed concubine who was also Egyptian. It's pretty unlikely in view of the very exclusive attitude the Ptolemies generally took to family matters.
