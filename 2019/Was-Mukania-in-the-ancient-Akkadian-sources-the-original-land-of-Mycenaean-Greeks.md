It’s rather unlikely. [Tiglath-Pileser III](https://www.ancient.eu/Tiglath_Pileser_III/), for example, brags about besieging a king of Mukania “like a bird in a cage”:

> The people of the land of Mukania saw the approach of my army and . the city of Ura which is in Musurni [MISSING] That one fled alone to save his life and [MISSING] like a mouse (?) he entered the gate of his city. His nobles I captured alive with my (own) hands and hung them on stakes and let his land gaze on them. 45(?) soldiers of my camp [MISSING] for the [MISSING] of his city I selected and like a bird in a cage I shut him up

but Tiglath-Pileser ruled in the 8th century BC, when Mycenae in Greece was a sleepy provincial town. Mycenae went into terminal decline in the 13th century BC and was an insignificant force in Tiglath-Pileser’s time. He will have encountered Greeks — he dealt with _Iamanaya_  , Ionian pirates — but he certainly never campaigned in the Peloponessus and nobody in the 8th century would have used Mycenae as shorthand for “Greeks”.
