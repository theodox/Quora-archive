You would rarely refer to any god or goddess by their ‘job title’ — that’s a modern simplification of the incredibly complex, unsystematic, and flat-out confusing world of Greek belief. Our tendency to treat gods and goddesses as cosmic bureaucrats with clearly defined responsibilities is not very accurate

Aphrodite was absolutely associated with “love” in a generic sense but that took a lot of very different forms. In Corinth, for example, Aphrodite’s temple was a famous tourist destination [because it was, basically, a brothel.](https://thesmartset.com/article11210701/)

> There, on account of the multitude of courtesans, who were sacred to Aphrodite, outsiders resorted in great numbers and kept holiday. And the merchants and soldiers who went there squandered all their money so that the following proverb arose in reference to them: 'Not for every man is the voyage to Corinth

In Sparta, on the other hand there was a temple of Aphrodite with her image wearing fetters — she symbolized the bond of faithfulness between husband and wife (presumably a big concern to Spartans, off on campaign). There was even — despite the fact that most of the time the Aphrodites are depicted naked — an Aphrodite Aidos, who was the patron of modesty.

Part of the confusion comes from the fact that Aphrodite also was how the Greeks described Near Eastern goddesses like [Ishtar, Inanna and Astarte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna). The worship of Aphrodite in Greek-speaking lands seems to have spread from Cyprus, close to Phoenicia (“Kypris”, or “Copper” was one of Aphrodite’s most common titles). Ishtar and her alter-egos had a fierce side as well as a lovey-dovey side — Ishtar, for example, had a thing for getting her former lovers dismembered,* and was a patroness of war and revenge as well as of fertility. Some of this may be reflected in the mythological relationship of Aphrodite and Ares, since Ares was the patron of reckless destruction and rage.

The Greeks were aware of the tensions in the image of this goddess. In later times they tended to distinguish between two different faces of the same goddess. [Aphrodite Urania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite_Urania) — “heavenly Aphrodite” — represented dignified, spiritualized romantic love; something like what we’d call “Platonic” love. On the other hand [Aphrodite Pandemos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite_Pandemos) — “Aphrodite of everyone” — was the physical side of love and passion. Of course in Athens, anyway, “heavenly” love was primarily homosexual while “everyone’s” love was heterosexual.

When Ishtar/Aphrodite began to merge with the Roman goddess Venus in the Roman era, her character became more domesticated and family oriented. The [Veneralia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneralia), a Roman festival associated with Venus, was more or less a festival devoted to public propriety. Ironically, the Veneralia was celebrated on what for us is April Fools Day.

The Caesars claimed descent from Aphrodite/Venus though [Aeneas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneas), so they liked to portray her in a respectable light. However Venus as was also the patroness of gambling —for example the best roll of the dice in the Roman version of craps was “the Venus throw.” When Caesar crossed the Rubicon and said “the die is cast” he was probably thinking of his great-to-the-Nth grandmother Venus.

So — It’s true that Aphrodite was associated with love in a variety of forms. It’s also true that this was neither a simple hearts and flowers goddess of romance nor sleazy goddess of raw sexuality. __Relationship status: It’s complicated__ .



* Gilgamesh to Innana:

> Listen to me while I tell the tale of your lovers. There was Tammuz, the lover of your youth, for him you decreed wailing, year after year. You loved the many-coloured [Lilac-breasted Roller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilac-breasted_roller), but still you struck and broke his wing [...] You have loved the lion tremendous in strength: seven pits you dug for him, and seven. You have loved the stallion magnificent in battle, and for him you decreed the whip and spur and a thong [...] You have loved the shepherd of the flock; he made meal-cake for you day after day, he killed kids for your sake. You struck and turned him into a wolf; now his own herd-boys chase him away, his own hounds worry his flanks.
