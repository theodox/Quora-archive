This is a broad question, because the two systems differed quite substantially, and they both changed over time. I'm going to simplify a lot.

In Athens, all questions were ultimately decided by the _direct vote_  of the _Ekklesia,_ or Assembly, which included all male citizens. [Carlos Rodrigo S치ez-Mu침oz](https://www.quora.com/profile/Carlos-Rodrigo-S치ez-Mu침oz)'s answer correctly points out how limited that was, however this a literal _democracy_ : the entire _demos,_ or citizen population, was the final authority on all legislation, questions of war and peace, and in theory any matter of goverment. This is, of course, a very unusual arrangement with few parallels in modern times. [Democracy Ancient and Modern ](http://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Ancient-Modern-Lectureship-Series/dp/0813511275)by M.I. Finley is a good, in-depth discussion of how radically different that is from modern democracy.

There were also rotating magistracies (the board of generals, the Council of 500 or [Boule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boule_%28ancient_Greece%29), and the [Areopagus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagus)) to handle day-to-day affairs. The generals were elected, which provided some degree of continuity in security policy. The councillors were usually chosen by lot from the whole citizen body, although there were some ways to be disqualified. Councillors provided some bureaucratic continuity and helped to prepare complex legislation such as treaties or new taxation schemes for presentation to the assembly, however any citizen could introduce a bill. All elective officers were effectively "tried" at the end of their term (the _euthunai_ or 'checking of receipts') to make sure they had been honest and just; while this was usually a formality, misbehavior, incompetence , or unpopularity could be punished with death.

There were some other magistracies as well, some of which predated the democracy; these were very limited in scope and frequently pertained only to religious matters (throughout the democratic period Athens had a "king archon" who handled religious duties that had once been the prerogative of the monarch).

In Rome, citizens (again, limited, though as the other answer points out much less limited than in Athens) could vote for laws and for executive officers, but access to office was strictly limited by property qualifications. The Roman system was very complex, evolving over time to reflect social and political changes in the city. In general it had three very different features from the Athenian version:

1) Collective voting: Citizens voted in groups, rather than as individuals. There were two different groupings: by 'centuries', a grouping based on property qualifications, or by 'tribes', a geographical grouping. The [Century Assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_Assembly) was very heavily tied to property qualifications -- the votes of the rich, grouped into many smaller centuries, counted more than the votes of the poor who were grouped into a small number of large centuries. The [Tribal Assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_Assembly) was less biased towards the rich (but residential segregation kept it from being fully egalitarian). Both bodies could enact laws, however there were many ways in which legislation could be prevented from reaching a vote: tribunes could prevent a law from being proposed, and other magistrates could postpone a vote based on auguries or other religious considerations (a rule notably abused on several occasions).

2) Magistracies. Both assemblies voted for magistrates: the top executive officers (Consuls and praetors) were elected by centuries , while the junior magistracies (aediles and quaestors) were elected by the tribes. After one-year terms the magistrates automatically became members of the Senate, which managed the day-to-day business of government and issued instructions to the magistrates. Roman magistrates were much more powerful than their Athenian counterparts; the Senate, since it directed the magistrates, had a permanent influence on the daily running of the state which the Council of Athens did not have (it also had far more institutional knowledge, since Senate membership was for life).

3) Tribunes. Tribunes were not ruling magistrates - they didn't have executive power but they could block the decisions of the magistrates -- our _veto_  is the Tribune's official announcement "I forbid". Tribunes could also introduce legislation to the assemblies. The tribunes were elected by the tribal assembly (some of the tribunal positions were limited to the [Plebs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebs), ie non-nobles citizens). There was no analog to the tribunes in Athens.

Overall the Roman system was much more complex and less directly tied to the mood of the people -- the officers were more powerful and influential, and the role of the popular mood much less important than in Athens. Most modern systems tend to be far more Roman than Athenian.
