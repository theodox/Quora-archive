Not exactly. You’ll see a lot of ancient sources that refer to “Ethiopians” but the Greek word (which the Romans picked up) was more general than a reference to the modern Ethiopian nation — it basically meant “dark skinned people”.

When the ancient sources talk about an Ethiopian state, they usually mean the region we call [Nubia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubia). Ancient Nubia had a long history of interaction with Egypt — Nubians used hieroglyphic writing, built pyramids, and followed many Egyptian religious practices. A [Nubian dynasty ruled Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt) in the eighth and seventh centuries BC. The kingdom of [Meroë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB), which was located in the modern Sudan, is the Nubian state we know best — however, because of the vagueness of the Greek vocabulary, it is usually described as “Ethiopia”.

Between the first and fourth centuries of our era Meroe was supplanted by the empire of [Axum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axum), which expanded northwards from it’s homeland in modern Ethiopia. Modern Ethiopian culture is heavily influenced by the history of Axum. It was a powerful kingdom with a strong trade relationship with Egypt, though it was the Egypt of the Roman Empire, not the Egypt of the Pharaohs. The modern symbol of that relationship is the [Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church) which is closely related to the [Coptic Orthodox Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Orthodox_Church_of_Alexandria) of Egypt; Axum converted to Christianity before the Romans did, under the influence of Egyptian Christians.
