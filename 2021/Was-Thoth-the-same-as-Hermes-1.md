Depends on who you want to listen to. The Greeks certainly thought so.

Granted, it’s easy to say no. Here’s Thoth in a pretty typical pose:

And here’s Hermes:

You could be forgiven for not spotting the family resemblance. But in antiquity the business of matching gods across cultural boundaries was complex and not very systematic. Thoth’s appearance and stories are one thing, but his big appeal in later Egyptian culture was as a patron of literature and of various kinds of esoteric knowledge — you’ll note that in the image above, Thoth is carrying a rolled up scroll in his left hand. Hermes had a lot of different jobs: guiding souls to the underworld, bringing good luck to merchants (and sometimes, con-men or petty criminals), running messages for Zeus to name a few.

Hermes was also associated with writing — that’s the basis of the connection. Greeks living in Egypt (or possibly, Egyptians talking things over with their Greek immigrants) decided that Hermes and Thoth were effectively the same god. This equation dates back to at least 500 BC or so, since Herodotus takes it for granted (he refers to the mummification of ibises, Thoth’s sacred bird, in [Hermopolis,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermopolis) the “city of Hermes” — which Egyptians would know as _Ḫmnw)._ 

Once that connection was made, it took on a life of its own which had a long and interesting afterlife, including the origins of Masonry and the reason we have a day called “Wednesday”,
