# Was the idea of neutrality one that would have made any sense to the Ancient Greeks?

"International Law" in general was not a strong suit for the Greeks. There were a lot of international norms (see [How much were the rules for not killing messengers adhered to in olden times?](https://www.quora.com/How-much-were-the-rules-for-not-killing-messengers-adhered-to-in-olden-times)) which were much admired in principle but ignored in practice. This was particularly true in the Hellenistic period, when several large powers battled for influence and propaganda victories across the Greek world: they simultaneously proclaimed the universal right of Greek cities to mind their own affairs without hindrance while constantly subjugating them by force with little or no pretext, The classic example in this period would be the [Siege of Rhodes (305 BC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Rhodes_(305_BC)) which was widely regarded as a completely baseless act of aggression brought on by the Great Power games between Ptolemy and Demetrius the Besieger.

The underlying, amoral reality is best documented by Thucydides in the [Melian dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melian_dialogue), an exchange between Athenian commanders demanding the surrender of the neutral but Spartan-descended island of Melos; the bone-chilling arguments are well dramatized in this video presentation, translated of course but faithful to the original:






A somewhat related aspect of this take-no-prisoners attitude is the [law of Solon](http://apaclassics.org/sites/default/files/documents/abstracts/vantwout.pdf) which allowed for amnesty to the losers in civil warfare -- but imposed exile on those who remained neutral in times of strife. Greece was a highly contentious place and neutrality was often looked on a weakness or double dealing.

Even so, the general norm was _supposed_  to be that different cities should leave each other alone unless given some kinds of 'justifiable' excuse. We know about the exceptions because they cluster around the highest power-political crises. 

 The main customary right of neutrals was the idea of [asylum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_(antiquity)): a city, a temple, or even a (noble) family could offer shelter to strangers and that was supposed to be a recognized right, protected by both custom and divine sanction. If you took in a fugitive and offered him asylum you assumed responsibility for him but pursuers were (in theory at least) obliged to respect your willingness to offer that right. This shows up a lot in mythology, which suggests it's a very old custom: Theseus took in [Oedipus](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199672783.001.0001/acprof-9780199672783-chapter-2), for example, and Croesus did the same for [Adrastus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrastus_(son_of_Gordias)). 

In historical times you see plenty of losers in the frequent civil wars of Greek cities being taken in by other cities where they could live free from persecution -- although in the intensely localized Greek world, exile itself was routinely described as a 'fate worse than death'. Particularly after the Peloponessian war Greece was full of exiles, since so many cities had civil strife -- one of the great crimes of the Spartan governor [Lysander](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Lysander*.html) was refusing to recognize the traditional safety-valve of exile and asylum for political minorities.
