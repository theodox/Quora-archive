The Romans did not do serial dating of any kind until quite late. When they picked up the habit, they didn’t pick up the AD/BC system.

__In the Republic and early empire the year was named for the two consuls.__  So, the Roman historian Livy opens every year of his massive account of early Rome with the naming of the consuls, and always uses the consular names to refer to dates. Thus:

> Proximo anno Num. Fabio Vibulano T. Quinctio Capitolini filio Capitolino consulibus ductu Fabii, cui sorte ea provincia evenerat, nihil dignum memoratu actum.

> The consuls for the next year were Numerius Fabius Vibulanus and T. Quinctius Capitolinus, the son of Capitolinus.

__By around the end of the first century it was becoming more common to use the reigning emperor’s ruling year__ , a habit picked up from the bureaucracies of old Hellenistic kingdoms. So for [the author of this contract in Roman Egypt](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Papyrus_793), our 94 AD was “year 13 of emperor Domitian.” This habit took longer to catch on in the Latin-speaking west.

The first Roman Christian calendar originated in Egypt. Like the rest of the empire, Egypt used the bureaucratic calendar based on the emperor’s regnal year. However the bloody persecutions of the emperor [Diocletian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian)(reigned 284–305) had a particularly traumatic impact on Egypt, which at that time had one of the largest Christian communities in the empire. To this day the Coptic Church of Egypt [maintains its own calendar based on what they call “the era of martyrs.” ](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/coptic-calendar.html)It begins in 284 AD with the accession of Diocletian, but it keeps the traditional Egyptian New Year’s day of 1 Thout, our September 11 (or September 12 in a leap year). This is referred to in English as the _anno matyrum_  calendar; this post was written on 13 Mesra, 1738 AM.

The Greek-speaking churches of the eastern empire and spent a lot of energy on straightening out the relationship between the events of secular Greek and Roman history and those recorded in the Bible. This process went on for a long, long time and there were always rival recreations — it was fairly easy to line up events after around what we’d call the sixth or seventh century BC but neither Greco-Roman nor Hebrew sources are very exact about things that happened earlier. Nonetheless, people tried — and, inevitably, they attempted to take things all the way back to Genesis and the creation of the world, which of course is very attractive if you’d like to make a serial calendar.

The source material leaves a lot of room for interpretation, and fixing a creation date it was highly contentious business for several centuries. Many Jewish communities tried the same thing; they came up with a different date in what we’d call 3761 BC. Folks who believe that the world was created in 4004 BC are latecomers to this old debate: they get their date from [the 17th century Anglican theologian James Ussher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ussher_chronology). But in the Roman empire, [the Greek-speaking churches gradually settled on the September 1, 5509 BC as the correct date for the creation of the world](https://orthochristian.com/97046.html).

By the beginning of the 8th century, the Ἔτος Κόσμου__ or “year of creation” dating was dominant in the Greek speaking churches. __Within a couple of hundred years the Roman (or “Byzantine”) state began using EK dates as well.__ These are based on the Julian calendar which loses a day relative to the modern Gregorian calendar every four hundred years. Today (19 August 2022 AD) is August 6, 7530 EK. People living in western Europe were familiar with this system but it never became popular in the Latin speaking world.

_[A Byzantine manuscript from the British Library](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_MS_28270)_ _, It’s hard to read but the third line from the bottom is_ __μηνὶ αὐγούστῳ εἰς τὴν γ ἡμέρᾳ ε΄ , ἐν ἔτει ςχιθ΄,__ _“in the month of August, on the 5th day, in the year 6619. This would equate to our August, 12, 1111. The Byzantine new year started in September, which is why 1111 + 5509 comes out here as 6619 and not 6620, and the old Byzantine calendar had lost a few days due to inaccurate leap year calculations._ 

__TLDR:__ 

The Roman state used a variety of dating systems : consular dates, regnal years, and the EK “year of creation” dates. But it never used either AD or BC during its existence. Around the 17th century the Greek Church adopted the western habit of using AD dating but that was long after the fall of Constantinople.
