# Would a major in classics (with a classical languages focus, not a classical studies focus) allow me to more easily learn other languages later on?

A lot depends on what kind of language education you’ve had so far, in English and other European languages.

If you have gotten a pretty laid back education in English some other western European language — you’re a good reader and a decent writer, but you don’t feel like you really grasp the rule-system underlying your communications and you do a lot by ear — then it can be very helpful. The switch from sentences structured by position to sentences structured by word endings forces you to really grasp the role that different words are playing. The subtle differences between the sense of time in Latin, Greek and modern languages will usually reveal any holes in your understanding of time in your native language. Confronting the reality of things like the [subjunctive ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjunctive_mood)or the [optative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optative_mood), which you may only know from conventional phrases, is a great way to see the bones of any language.

That said — if your education was relatively old-fashioned, with a solid foundation in traditional grammar then the benefits will be less obvious. You’ll still get a lot of value for any European language — the vocabulary is very helpful for any Romance language. If you’ve never learned and inflected language like German or Russian the transition will be much easier if you’ve already learned to deal with inflection in Latin and Greek.

I’m a terrible language student, I completely lack the linguists’ native knack. My ability to pick up new bits and pieces comes entirely from what I picked up (or equally often, failed to grasp right away) in classics.
