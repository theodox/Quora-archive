The dating for Jesus’ birth was already traditional by Dionysius’ time. Tertullian, Irenaeus and Origen, writing in the late second and early third centuries, all offer dates that would be either our 2 BC or 1 BC depending on how you read them.

So, Dionysius wasn’t innovating on that score. His only innovation was to use that (existing) landmark as a reference point for his calendar tables. His primary intention was to resolve the proper date solar-calendar for Easter, which was a really tough problem since it came at the intersection of several conflicting calendrical systems (Greek, Roman and Jewish). He wasn’t the first or the last author to get caught up in the controversy, which continued to be a source of argument for another 400 years.

The use of AD dating was mostly a change in notation from the Roman system; Dionysus just added 283 years to the [Diocletianic year](http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810104747704) numbers that were in use at the time (and which are still the basis of the [Coptic calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_calendar)). AD dating never became dominant in the Greek east (and only in the west rather later) — it was a convenience that (among other things) allowed him to remove the name of Diocletian, a violent persecutor of Christians, from his technical discussion of the calendar system.

In any case, there’s no reason to think he “made it up”, in the sense that he arbitrarily decided to stick Jesus halfway between Constantine and Alexander to make some kind of point. [Olympiad dates](http://www.tyndalehouse.com/Egypt/ptolemies/chron/olympic/chron_ol_cal_fr.htm) were easy to come by for both rulers, so he could have split the difference exactly if he wanted to — but what were his landmarks? Alexander’s death? Constantines? That would have been the closest to the numbers in the question but splitting that difference would have landed in 7 AD. Alexander’s conquest of Egypt and the battle of the Milvian Bridge? That’d give you something like 9 BC.

Sounds like somebody just [noticed a coincidence and invented a conspiracy](https://theodox.quora.com/Damn-you-internet). You certainly don’t see any reference to either Constantine or Alexander in the [dry and hard to parse original text](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/dionysius_exiguus_easter_01.htm#Preface) .
