I'd be pretty surprised. There are no languages living or dead that derive from Sumerian.

There might be a couple of Akkadian words since Akkadian > Aramaic is not inconceivable and Aramaic > bible > European languages definitely happens (for example, “abbott” from _abba_ )

“Annunaki” and “Nibiru” don't really pass the proper name test, and “Tiamat” is both a proper name and a d&d reference so that's two strikes.

Nebuchadnezzar of biblical fame is a personal name of course but the Nabu is Sumerian, even though the rest is Akkadian.

However (!) there is one common _image_  that is authentically Sumerian. The zodiac sign for Capricorn derives from the Sumerian depiction of the god [Enki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enki), whose avatars or symbols included the goat and the fish:

Most of our zodiac symbols are Akkadian/Babylonian but this one seems to go all the way back.
