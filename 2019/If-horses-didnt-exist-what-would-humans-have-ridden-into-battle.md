No need to hypothesize: we know.

Before there was cavalry, there was _assery_ .

This is a panel from the[ Standard of Ur](https://www.penn.museum/sites/iraq/?page_id=48), a Sumerian artwork from about 4600 years ago. It depicts the fearsome battle-carts of a Sumerian army, drawn by _kungas_ , hybrids between donkeys and [onagers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onager) . The world’s first empire — the [Akkadian empire of Sargon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire) — rode to power on the somewhat creaky wheels of ass-drawn carts like these. This is probably the oldest existing depiction of humans “riding in to battle;” it predates the evidence of horse-drawn chariots or horseback riding by about 500 years.

Donkeys are strong and well adapted to the heat and dry climate of the Middle East. It appears that donkeys were first domesticated in the Nile Valley about 6000 years ago, and they quickly became a prized commodity — they feature prominently in the burials of early Egyptian kings. The “donkey trade” however eventually centered in Sumer, where they formed a vital part of the region’s commercial networks as both pack and riding animals. The city of Nagar (modern [Tell Brak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_Brak), in Syria) was a famous breeding center for _kungas_ , which combined the domesticity of donkeys with the hardiness of wild onagers: they fetched fifty times the price of an ordinary ass. In the third millennium BC, [possession of a kunga was a status symbol](https://journals.openedition.org/syria/2664?lang=en) much like the ownership of a fine horse would be in later times; rich lords were buried with their carts and prized asses.

The ass was eventually superseded by the horse. Donkeys tend to be better suited to pack-carriage than to saddles: they specialize in endurance rather than speed (or panache). Even in cuneiform texts there are complaints about their unwillingness to do what they are asked (“my ass knows how to bray, but not to carry a load”). Donkeys are also generally less willing to put themselves in harm’s way than horses, so they don’t make ideal cavalry steeds. Asses are [too smart](https://ker.com/equinews/test-suggests-donkeys-mules-smarter-horses/) to let themselves be ridden into battle without complaining. They are also not great at stealth — though, on the other hand, [on at least one occasion ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Scythian_campaign_of_Darius_I)the noise made by an imperial Persian donkey corps saved the army of Darius I from an ambush by Scythian cavalry, whose horses disliked the ruckus.

So, the donkey as a battle platform has passed its prime. On the other hand, donkeys (though not as common as mules) [remain a part of military logistics today](https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-donkeys7-2009jul07-story.html). The day of cavalry has come and gone, but jack-assery endures.
