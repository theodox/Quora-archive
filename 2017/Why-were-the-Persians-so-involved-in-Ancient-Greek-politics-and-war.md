It’s classic imperial politics: all empires are inextricably involved in the affairs of their neighbors. It goes double when the empire includes a substantial population whose compatriots live in a neighboring country that’s part of the empire.

The Persians didn’t _exactly_  conquer the Greeks — the conquered the kingdom of Lydia, which has some kind of not-clearly-spelled-out hegemony over most of the Greek cities in Asia minor. This gave them a substantial Greek population who had widely varying degrees of enthusiasm for Persian rule (it’s worth remembering that plenty of Greeks were happy and loyal Persians subjects right up until the end; our sources are extremely biased towards the point of view of Athens, which was politically very invested in the idea of a greater Greece and a pan-hellenic alliance against the “barbarians.” Other viewpoints definitely existed, but they left fairly little written record).

Because some of the Ionian Greeks were not particularly happy to be Persian subjects — and because Greek politics produced a lot of angry partisans who would call in any outside power they could find against their local enemies — there was no shortage of excuses for outside powers (Athens and Sparta in particular, but also Egypt under Amasis, the Scythians, and the Thracians) to intervene in Asia minor.

So, the Persians were just doing what successful empires do: making sure that the game was being played on the other guy’s lawn. Marathon, Salamis and Plataea taught them that out-and-out conquest was a very expensive way to manage the potential problem. Spreading a little gold around in Greece was a cheap and effective way to keep potential troublemakers busy slitting each others’ throats. The Persians were always happy to ally with whatever Greek power was down at any given moment: they backed Sparta against Athens and vice versa, they backed Thebes against Sparta, Athens against Macedon… in short, they always backed underdogs to keep Greek politics from producing a potential rival. This policy didn’t stop Macedon largely because of the [Great Satraps' Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Satraps%27_Revolt), war in Egypt, and the machinations of [Bagoas](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bagoas-the-greek-name-of-two-eunuchs-from-the-achaemenid-period), which prevented Persia form pursuing it’s traditional policy aggressively.
