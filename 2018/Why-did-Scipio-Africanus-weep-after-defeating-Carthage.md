> At the sight of the city utterly perishing amidst the flames Scipio burst into tears, and stood long reflecting on the inevitable change which awaits cities, nations, and dynasties, one and all, as it does every one of us men. This, he thought, had befallen Troy, once a powerful city, and the once mighty empires of the Assyrians, Medes, Persians, and that of Macedonia lately so splendid. And unintentionally or purposely he quoted [Homer],—the words perhaps escaping him unconsciously,—

> _The day shall be when holy Troy shall fall
And Priam, lord of spears, and Priam's folk._ 

> And on my asking him boldly (for I had been his tutor) what he meant by these words, he did not name Rome distinctly, but was evidently fearing for her, from this sight of the mutability of human affairs. . .

This from [Polybius](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D39%3Achapter%3D5), who was there.

Interestingly the conqueror who sees an evil portent in his own victory is something of a trope. For example, when [Aemilius Paulus](http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/paulus.html) captured Perseus of Macedon — the last heir of the kingdom which had once been Alexander’s — he delivered this speech to his officers:

> can you, when you see before your eyes the succession of Alexander himself, who arrived at the height of power and ruled the greatest empire, in the short space of an hour trodden underfoot… when you behold a king, that was but even now surrounded with so numerous an army, receiving nourishment to support his life from the hands of his conquerors- can you, I say, believe there is any certainty in what we now possess whilst there is such a thing as chance? No, young men, cast off that vain pride and empty boast of victory; sit down with humility, looking always for what is yet to come, and the possible future reverses which the divine displeasure may eventually make the end of our present happiness.

It’s frequently noted that the elation of victory gives way to something like depression in the victor. This kind of rhetoric was the classical way to channel that emotion; to provide it with a philosophical context where we would probably throw in some second-hand pop psychology.
