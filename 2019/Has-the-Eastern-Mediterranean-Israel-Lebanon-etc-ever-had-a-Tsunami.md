Yes.

The most famous — and terrifying — one is is the destruction of [Thera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption) (the modern island of Santorini) which exploded sometime between about 1600 and 1500 BC. This was a larger and more destructive eruption than that of Krakatoa but — because of the very ancient date — there are no clear contemporary references or descriptions. [Archaeologists believe that several Minoan settlements on the north coast Crete were damaged or destroyed by earthquake and tsunami activity from the Thera explosion ](http://www.24grammata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Antonopoulos-24grammata.com-.pdf)— the evidence seems to show 9-meter waves hitting the Cretan coast. Mainland Greece and Asia Minor in this period were less densely populated, so clear evidence is harder to come by.

The best recorded tsunami comes about two millennia later. In 365 there were terrible tsunamis in the eastern Mediterranean, most famously destroying the seaside quarters of Alexandria with great loss of life and the permanent loss of much of the city’s historic heart:

> … on the twenty-first of July in the first consulship of Valentinian with his brother [=365] horrible phenomena suddenly spread through the entire extent of the world, such as are related to us neither in fable nor in truthful history. For a little after daybreak, preceded by heavy and repeated thunder and lightning, the whole of the firm and solid earth was shaken and trembled, the sea with its rolling waves was driven back and withdrew from the land, so that in the abyss of the deep thus revealed men saw many kinds of sea-creatures stuck fast in the slime; and vast mountains and deep valleys, which Nature, the creator, had hidden in the unplumbed depths, then, as one might well believe, first saw the beams of the sun. Hence, many ships were stranded as if on dry land, and since many men roamed about without fear in the little that remained of the waters, to gather fish and similar things with their hands, the roaring sea, resenting, as it were, this forced retreat, rose in its turn; and over the boiling shoals it dashed mightily upon islands and broad stretches of the mainland, and levelled innumerable buildings in the cities and where else they were found; so that amid the mad discord of the elements the altered face of the earth revealed marvellous sights. For the great mass of waters, returning when it was least expected, killed many thousands of men by drowning; and by the swift recoil of the eddying tides a number of ships, after the swelling of the wet element subsided, were seen to have foundered, and lifeless bodies of shipwrecked persons lay floating on their backs or on their faces. Other great ships, driven by the mad blasts, landed on the tops of buildings (as happened at Alexandria), and some were driven almost two miles inland, like a Laconian ship which I myself in passing that way saw near the town of Mothone, yawning apart through long decay.

[Ammianus Marcellinus, XXVI](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/26*.html)

Between the eruption of Thera and the swamping of Alexandria there were others tsunamis as well, but only a minority show up in the written record. For example a tsunami destroyed the city of [Helike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helike) in 373 BC. but we know about it because the submerged walls of the city were noted by tourists as a curiosity in the Roman period; there’s no contemporary record of the event.
