On the literary level, I’d get a good translation of the epic of Gilgamesh. The [Stephen Mitchell translation ](https://www.amazon.com/Epic-Gilgamesh-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449191/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=gilgamesh&qid=1635743485&qsid=140-0560421-2384066&sr=8-8&sres=0743261690%2C0300251181%2C0618275649%2C0393643980%2C014044100X%2C0802852629%2CB01ESELZNO%2C0374523835%2C0199538360%2C0887764363%2CB00W36KEOG%2C0887764371%2C0887763804%2C1477589864%2CB00B0HYMJC%2CB07VC16ZVB%2CB008YSXG4C%2C0985930942%2C1718018312%2C0691195242&srpt=ABIS_BOOK)is pretty good; so is[ the one by Andrew George](https://www.amazon.com/Epic-Gilgamesh-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449191/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=gilgamesh&qid=1635743485&qsid=140-0560421-2384066&sr=8-8&sres=0743261690%2C0300251181%2C0618275649%2C0393643980%2C014044100X%2C0802852629%2CB01ESELZNO%2C0374523835%2C0199538360%2C0887764363%2CB00W36KEOG%2C0887764371%2C0887763804%2C1477589864%2CB00B0HYMJC%2CB07VC16ZVB%2CB008YSXG4C%2C0985930942%2C1718018312%2C0691195242&srpt=ABIS_BOOK) — here’s a video lecture by the latter, to give you the flavor and also some insights into why this is all so worth learning about:



Samuel Noah Kamer’s [Sumerian Mythology](https://amzn.to/2Y46eHl) has the great advantage of being written by one of the great scholars of Sumerian, though it’s not that recent. Stephanie Dalley’s [Myths from Mesopotamia](https://amzn.to/3BzQyZQ) is also pretty solid. Both of these are based closely on the original sources. If you want one that’s not quite so archaic, [Mesopotamian Mythology ](https://amzn.to/3EpBn7A)by Matt Clayton is a bit less arcane but still pretty close to the real stuff
