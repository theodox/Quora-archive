There’s several ways to look at it, and it’s not obvious to me at any rate that one or another is the ‘right’ way.

The most obvious answer is the famous old line about “[bread and circuses](http://www.capitolium.org/eng/imperatori/circenses.htm)” — which actually dates back to the famous Roman grouch [Juvenal,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenal) a disgruntled moralist who complained that with the death of the Republic and the rise of the Empire, the Roman people who had traded their freedom for government handouts and mindless entertainment. In this view the Caesars provided food and public entertainments to keep the urban poor content — in a tightly packed city firetrap of a city, no emperor could afford to let the urban mob grow too restless.

If you go with that view, the games are basically just a distraction — a way of keeping the populace fixated on trivial entertainments instead of political change, or in some opinions a way of sublimating the anger of the suppressed masses by giving it a violent outlet. This a very cynical, if very practical way of looking at it. The Roman orator Fronto, for example, praised emperor [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan) for devoting as much energy to his domestic entertainments as to his foreign wars, saying “neglect of serious matters can cause greater damage, but neglect of amusements greater discontent.”

Another way of looking at it, though, is that the games were an expression of social solidarity — a Roman version of a social safety net. It’s this view the “bread” is more important than the “circuses” — but in fact they typically went together. A triumphant general, an ambitious politician, or an emperor trying to secure his popularity would set up what amounted to public picnics for a large fraction of the city. For lower-class Romans — who lived mostly on coarse bread, beans, and olive-oil — a public feast or a lavish temple sacrifice would be one of their few chances to get meat or fish.

This tradition of public support actually predates the Empire by some centuries — in the days of the Republic, ambitious politicians vied for popular support by sponsoring public feasts and games. Roman debates about the role of public welfare — is it offering your fellow citizens a helping hand, or teaching them to be shiftless spongers? is it just a bribe to get their votes? — are surprisingly like our own. The Empire was founded by Caesar, who represented the _populares —_ the faction that claimed to champion the interests of ordinary people against the wealthy. The emperors were usually disliked by the aristocracy, who took a long time to forget that they had been the dominant power under the Republic — so it’s far from impossible that some of them, anyway, were quite conscious of their social responsibilities as protectors of the poorer classes — as well as of the political value of having popular support should the aristocracy ever decide to reassert itself.

Finally, there’s the ancient Roman tradition of aristocratic display. Roman values took shape in an era when the upper classes in general had to prove their worth by conspicuous displays of generosity. Games and feasts were the most obvious examples but not the only ones - every wealthy Roman had a _[clientela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage_in_ancient_Rome)_ _,_ a following of people who were personally indebted to him and repayed that debt with political and social support. If you went to court, you’d get your wealthy patron to put in a good word for you; if you ran out of money, he’d arrange a loan or even a gift to get you by. In return you paid court to him — paying social calls, passing along useful news, doing whatever little services were in your power to repay his patronage. It’s actually quite reminiscent of the way Don Corleone treats the various civilians and small-timers who cross his path: he will “take care of it for you”, but “there will come a day when he will ask something of you.”

In this view, the games are a symbol of how far the emperors outstrip any potential aristocratic competitors. A huge public feast or gladiatorial show demonsrates that the emperor’s _clientela_ is the greatest of them all — where a wealthy nobleman might have dozens or hundreds of people dependent on him for help in hard times, for support in a legal case, or for assistance when dealing with the government the emperor takes the entire populace under his wing_._  In this view it’s the games and festivals are not about practical generosity or practical bribery — they are an ostentatious display of status on the emperor’s part.

As I said, all of these ways of looking at it have some merit, and they are not really mutually exclusive. It’s a complicated, but eminently Roman thing.
