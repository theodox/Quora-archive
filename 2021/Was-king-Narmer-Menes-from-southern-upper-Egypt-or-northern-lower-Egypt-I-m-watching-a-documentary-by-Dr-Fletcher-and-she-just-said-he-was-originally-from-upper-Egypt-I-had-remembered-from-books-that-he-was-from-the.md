# Was king Narmer (Menes) from southern (upper) Egypt or northern (lower) Egypt? I’m watching a documentary by Dr. Fletcher and she just said he was originally from upper Egypt. I had remembered from books that he was from the north, thoughts?

It’s believed that Narmer’s base of operations was [Hierakonpolis](https://interactive.archaeology.org/hierakonpolis/temple.html#:~:text=Based%20on%20this%20palette%20and,500%20years%20before%20Narmer's%20birth.) (Nekhen), which is in the middle of Upper Egypt (between Thebes and Edfu). The famous [Narmer Palette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer_Palette) is from Hierakonpolis.
