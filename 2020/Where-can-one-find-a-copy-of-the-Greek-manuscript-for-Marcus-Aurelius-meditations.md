Here is a good rundown on the manuscript tradition behind modern editions of Marcus Aurelius: [Notes on the manuscript tradition of Marcus Aurelius’ “Meditations”](https://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2014/07/14/notes-on-the-manuscript-tradition-of-marcus-aurelius-meditations/) The oldest reference to the book itself is a letter from one Byzantine bishop to another around the year 907 mentioning a new copy made from a shabby original (a good example of the [real life of manuscripts](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-scholars-use-Greek-sources-like-Homer-and-Herodotus-when-studying-ancient-history-even-though-not-a-single-manuscript-has-been-found-that-was-actually-written-by-them/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=342e2b4a&srid=zLvM)).

The most complete survivor is Vaticanus Graecus 1950, which unfortunately is not digitized yet. It’s not a great copy in any case — unfortunately the superior manuscript (which was the basis for all modern editions) was lost sometime after the publication of the first printed edition in 1559. However it was a good copy, and luckily it was committed to print in a well edited version by [Wilhelm Xylander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Xylander) before its disappearance. VG 1950 and most of the other msss are 14th or 15th century copies which would be late Byzantine in origin.

If you just want to see the Greek text, there’s a good version (in a clunky format, alas) here: [M. Antonius Imperator Ad Se Ipsum](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0641%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D1). You can also get the same base text with a parallel English translation from the [Loeb Classical Library](https://amzn.to/3l8pXw8).
