# Did ancient Greeks know that Ilion (or New Ilion) in Troas was the location of the Trojan War? The Iliad was legendary to them. If so, was Ilion held in high regard? Were the Aeolians there revered?

The location was a tourist attraction in antiquity. The most famous visitor was Alexander the Great, who [made a point of stopping off at Troy for the beginning of his campaign in the east](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/plutarch/plutarchs-alexander/plutarch-on-alexanders-visit-to-troy/):

> Alexander went up to Troy, sacrificed to Athena and poured a libation to the heroes.

> At the tomb of Achilles, after anointing himself with oil and taking part in a race naked with his Companions, as is the custom, he deposited crowns and remarked how fortunate Achilles was to have had a faithful friend while he was alive and a great herald of his fame after his death.

> While he was going sightseeing about the town someone asked him whether he wanted to see the lyre of Alexander [that is, Homer’s Paris] he replied that he was not interested in that one, but was looking for the lyre of Achilles, to which he used to sing the glorious deeds of brave heroes.

As you can see there were even dubious tourist attractions, like the supposed lyre of Paris which would have been about eight hundred years old in Alexander’s day.
