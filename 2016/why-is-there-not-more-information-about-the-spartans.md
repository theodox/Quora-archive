This is a great example of how source material influences history. Although Sparta was a literate society it was definitely not a _literary_  society: it was one where learning was often associated with idleness and where the written word was regarded with a certain amount of suspicion . Lycurgus, the half-mythical lawgiver who created Sparta's distinctive institutions, famously forbade them from writing their laws and contracts down, believing that written words could be twisted but words kept alive in the collective memory would not be. 

Sparta was also deeply averse to casual talk and flights of verbal fancy: our word _laconic_ comes from Laconia, the Spartan heartland -- Spartans were famously terse, and all of the [famous Spartan sayings](http://www.ancientgreekbattles.net/Pages/47931_Spartaquotes.htm) were models of brevity (particularly in the view of the other Greeks, who were notoriously wordy). 

To top it all off, the Spartan economic system was deliberately designed to prevent the accumulation of wealth -- which meant that it also produced very little in the way of art and architecture. Thucydides said of Sparta,

> Suppose the city of Sparta to be deserted, and nothing left but the temples and the ground-plan, distant ages would be very unwilling to believe that the power of the Lacedaemonians was at all equal to their fame. 

For all these reasons, the Spartans left almost no first-hand records of their own. There are a [handful of poets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ancient_Spartan_poets) before the 7th century BC, and one of the legendary "[Seven Sages of Greece](http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/LX/SevenSagesOfGreece.html)" was supposedly the Spartan [Chilon the Wise](http://spartareconsidered.blogspot.com/2013/01/a-spartan-philosopher-chilon-wise.html). But there are no Spartan philosophers, historians or dramatists -- not even in the footnotes of the other works. There are no famous Spartan buildings or artworks. 

The popular image of Sparta is second hand: it comes primarily from [Xenophon ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon)(an Athenian, but an admirer) and [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch) (who lived several hundred years after the classical Spartan heyday). The rest of what we know comes from Athenian authors like Thucydides, Aristotle and Plato or Athenians-by-adoption like Herodotus. Athens, of course, as the commercial and literary capital of Greece, dominates our sources and heavily influences all of our views. As Thucydides noted:

> ...whereas, if the same fate befell the Athenians, the ruins of Athens would strike the eye, and we should infer their power to have been twice as great as it really is. 

The best sources for classical Sparta are 


Plutarch's [ Customs of the Spartans](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Instituta_Laconica*.html), [Lycurgus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Lycurgus*.html), [Agis](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Agis*.html), [Cleomenes ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cleomenes*.html)and [Agesilaus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Agesilaus*.html)

Xenophon's [The Polity of the Lacedaemonians ](http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_xenophon_lacedaemonians.htm)

Aristotle's [Constitution of the Spartans](http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/aristotle-sparta.asp)

The other famous stories -- particularly those about the Persian war, are in Herodotus.

For a good modern look at Sparta in action you can check out the work of [Donald Kagan](http://amzn.to/1RiYTWq), whose work on the Peloponessian war is covers Sparta's biggest contest in detail. You might also check out [Sparta Reconsidered](http://elysiumgates.com/~helena/index.html) for an effort to 'rehabilitate' the Spartans from their militaristic image.
