# If the Zulu were given the same general resources as the Romans were, what would the Impi hypothetically look like?

I suspect they’d actually look a lot alike: both forces operated in somewhat similar modes.

Zulu _ibuthos_  were armed with a stabbing spear and a tower shield. Their primary tactic was close-order melee combined. Like the Roman legions, were mobile and flexible on the battlefield.

Early Roman legions operated in much the same way, with tactics centered on the shield and a stabbing spear (the [hasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasta_(spear))), although later this was replaced with throwing spears ([pila)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilum) backed up by stabbing swords.

These are tactically quite similar. The obvious difference is the presence of metal armor, which is actually a fairly complex technology with a lot of support infrastructure behind it (even in the later Empire, the Romans traded weapons with their barbarian neighbors, but they maintained strict export controls over _armor)._ Assuming the Zulus had access to the whole pyramid of resources and tech needed to fabricate the armor they would probably ended up looking similar.

Of course there’ a another big _if_  in the form of cavalry: Horses only showed up in southern Africa in the 17th century, and although there were definitely Zulu horsemen by the time of the [Anglo-Zulu War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Zulu_War) I don’t think they were ever used as units. The presence or absence of cavalry has lots of implications for how you fit out an army: the assegai is shorter than a hasta, for example, because it doesn’t have to be used as a pike to discourage enemy horsemen.

Lastly there’s climate: The _impi_  were famous for their mobility. Shaka made his warriors run barefoot (!) to increase speed — an effective but punishing practice which enabled them to force march as much as fifty miles in a day: twice what the legions were expected to do. If you burdened the Zulus with metal corselets and helmets your also be giving away one of their key strengths (and, probably, killing a lot of them with heat stroke).
