# The word God in most romance languages was derived from Zeus. Do the Christian speakers of those languages feel comfortable to worship Dio, Dios, Deus or Dieu?

It’s only derived from the hypothetical proto-Indo-European root word *_deiwos_ which seems to have mean “a god” — though with what shades of meaning in the long-vanished tongue of the steppes of 7000 years ago we can’t pretend to say. This word’s descendants include _dia_ in Scots and Irish, and _deva_  in Hindi.

Interestingly in Avestan it becomes [daeva ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daeva)— but the dualist tendency in many Iranic religions made _daevas_ into promoters of chaos rather than order. In many languages of south Asia variants of this word are now used for evil spirits. Despite the similarity of sounds, however, there’s no actual connection between _daeva_  and “devil.”

*_deiwos_ may or may not be connected to the equally hypothetical _[*dyḗws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyeus)_ _,_ which is believed to be the ultimate original of the proper names Zeus in Greek, [Dyaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyaus) in Sanskrit, and Jove or Jupiter, “Ious-Pater” in Latin. These names all seem to go back to an idea about the brightness of the daytime sky; in the Iliad, Achilles is also described as _dios,_ “shining” or “bright” — another version of the same root.

Whatever the pre-history of these words was, the here’s no time in _recorded_ history, when the distinction between ordinary nouns like _deus_ in Latin and _theos_  in Greek on the one hand, and proper names like Zeus and Jupiter on the other, was not well understood.
