For the city as a whole, this might help:

The same site includes more detailed incident reports. Seattle in general is a pretty safe city, but you can't be careless. Belltown, the "Ave" in the University district, and Pioneer Square can all be dicey, particularly after dark; Lake City, northern Greenwood, and Rainier Valley / MLK boulevard are tougher neighborhoods than most of the rest of Seattle. Beyond that it's very situational.
