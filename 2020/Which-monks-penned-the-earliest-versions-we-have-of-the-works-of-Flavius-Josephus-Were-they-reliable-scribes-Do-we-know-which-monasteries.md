Josephus’ manuscript tradition is pretty broad — despite his defects as a writer he was very popular. Since he wrote two large books (the _Antiquities of the Jews_  and _The Jewish War_ ) and two smaller ones (_Against Apion_ and the _Life_ ) it’s tough to sum up the state of the tradition overall, but in general, as a writer who circulated pretty widely, the ms tradition is fairly strong. There’s a good roundup [here](http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/manuscripts/josephus_all.htm), which covers the details. But you can get a good sense of the spread on [this page](https://pinakes.irht.cnrs.fr/notices/oeuvre/610/), which covers much more than merely the oldest ones.



One very important thing to remember about Josephus is that in western Europe, the Greek original texts seems to have been completely lost until the Renaissance. Josephus was a very popular author, circulating widely in Latin translations — but as late as the 1520’s, scholars did not believe that the original Greek texts survived. There are really three text streams in the Latin — a translation of the _War_ ascribed to [Tyrannius Rufinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannius_Rufinus) in the late 4th century, and a translation of the _Antiquities of the Jews_ done at the behest of [Cassiodorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiodorus) in the 6th c, and a paraphrase of parts of the _War_ ascribed to “Hegesippus” — sometimes confused with a second-century [Hegesippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegesippus_(chronicler)), but not necessarily the same person.

The Greek texts began arriving in Italy in the 16th century, both as part of the revival of interest in Greek generally and then due to the collapse of the Byzantine Empire. The first printed version of Josephus in Greek was in 1544. However once the Greek texts arrived, western scholars generally stopped using the Latin texts — almost three centuries elapsed between the first printed edition of the Latin Josephus (in 1524) and the second (in 1837).

The editions in circulation today generally all go back to the collation of [Benedikt Niese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedikt_Niese). His text is online at [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus%3Acorpus%3Aperseus%2Cauthor%2CFlavius%20Josephus), but unfortunately the online version does not include the usual critical apparatus which (given the large number of manuscripts in circulation) was pretty complex.

__Jewish War__ 

Surprisingly, there’s one _very_ old fragment on papyrus, [Pap. Graec. Vindob. 29810](https://books.google.com/books?id=X9YUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=Pap.+Graec.+Vindob.+29810&source=bl&ots=pZ-dU_X42L&sig=ACfU3U06k2MQqpKyQDL57lLlRLSMxBiO4A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjczImHm6zpAhUaJzQIHTkuCyoQ6AEwAXoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false). — a section of book 2 of the _Jewish War_  which dates to the 3d century. Unfortunately its not available online anywhere — however it’s a remarkable find. Physical texts this old are _extremely_ rare, so this is an interesting find although its so small it doesn’t affect our understanding of the text in any meaningful way apart to confirm a small segment of the text.

Generally, though, the oldest texts date (as so often) are codices from the 10th and 11th centuries. Given the lifespan of parchment these are probably only one or two generations removed from Roman-era papyri like the fragment above.

There are two broad families of manuscripts of the _Jewish War_ . One group contains the [Codex Parisinus Graecus 1425](https://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc215210) from the 10th or 11th century and the Codex Ambrosianus D 50 sup from around the same time. The second group contains Codex Vaticanus Graecus 148 and Codex Palatinus Graecus 248 (neither available digitally) are both from the 11th or 12th century. Most of the other original manuscripts are similar in date to these four or a bit later, and seem to represent mixings of these two main traditions.

_A bit of Parisinus Graecus 1425 (note: the arabic-numeral page numbers are a late addition)._ 

Niese regarded the first group as superior in quality, though modern scholars are less certain that the differences are quite so strong. The divergence in the texts is visible in third-party quotations of the the text as far back as Porphyry in the 3d century: this illustrates both how manual copying is prone to drift, but also how wide circulation provides a check on textual degradation. Several extant manuscripts seem to borrow from both of the two main families, another indication that the divergences is much older than any of our existing mss and that copyists down the years made their own efforts to retain the quality of the texts.

There’s also a _very_ ancient, but somewhat erratic, Latin translation in the form of [codex Ambrosiana Cimelio 1](http://ambrosiana.comperio.it/opac/detail/view/ambro:catalog:908500) a sixth century Latin papyrus. Mss this old are rare and precious — however the translator was not a great Greek scholar (and Josephus is not a particularly elegant Greek writer) so the result is sometimes hard to read. It does however provide a useful check on the Greek text in a few places. It’s not impossible that this text passed through the hands of Cassiodorus himself, perhaps inspiring him to commission a translation of the _Antiquities._

_A bit of the Cimelio papyrus ms._ 

Latin versions of the Jewish War were quite common in the Middle Ages — there are over 170 manuscrtipts from all over Europe. You can see it online alongside Niese’s Greek text and an English translation [here](https://sites.google.com/site/latinjosephus/bellum-judaicum/book-1-Froben) (note that the Whiston translation, which is over a hundred years older than Niese, is very common online but is based on a fairly poor text that predates Niese’s edition by more than a century).

__Antiquities__ 

The Antiquities was a much larger book and so it was typically copied into smaller volumes — our books I-X in one codex and XI-XX plus the _Life_  in another. This complicates the manuscript tradition even more.

However it’s fair to say that again the oldest manuscripts are Byzantine work from the 10th and 11th centuries. The Ambrosianus D 50 sup and [Parisianus Graecus 1419](https://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc21514h) are both pretty typical products of the [Macedonian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_Renaissance). [Codex Ambrosiana F128 (gr 370)](https://ambrosiana.comperio.it/opac/detail/view/ambro:catalog:74106) is likewise a solid workaday text.

_A section of the Ambrosiana F128 ms — a pretty businesslike Greek copy. The marginal notes at right are in another hand, probably notes added by readers — the bottom one, for example, says “Cambyses, king of the Persians after Cyrus.” Even the marginalia are abbreviated for example Κύρου become Κύρ\, and τῶν becomes τ. Parchment was expensive._ 

Here again there were also Latin versions — in fact, the oldest large extant text is actually a Latin translation (again, this is presumably a text done for Cassiodorus). The oldest MS is [Staatsbibliothek Bamberg Msc.Class.78](https://www.bavarikon.de/object/bav:SBB-KHB-00000SBB00000114) — a quite lovely, high quality copy done sometime in the 9th century in northern Italy.

Overall then the modern ms. date to the “Macedonian renaissance” period, when interest in classic texts of all kinds was running high in the Greek-speaking world. If you compare the digital versions [here ](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/byzantium/paleog.asp)you’ll see they’re clearly workaday texts. The fairly close range of dates probably reflects the transition to [minuscule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_minuscule) hands — the older uncial manuscripts will have been fairly “old fashioned,” or at least quite formal, by this period.

Unfortunately for us Byzantine scribes in this period are usually anonymous. The Pinakes link above does include a few names for early ms, but I don’t think any of Niese’s principal texts have names attached; I happened to note one of the Vatican mss (but not one cited above) was an abbot of the monastry of Christos Panoiktirmon in Constantinople — this foundation (which dates from around the time of the manuscripts) happens to be one for which we have [good documentation](https://www.academia.edu/39442117/Inside_the_Library_of_an_Eleventh-Century_Eunuch_Monastery) ; like several many monastic communities it was a private foundation, not directly controlled by the regular clergy or the church. It might also be worth checking out some articles on the Byzantine approach to [book-collecting in general](https://www.academia.edu/36012341/Securing_and_Preserving_Written_Documents_in_Byzantium._In_Alessandro_Bausi_Alessandro_Christian_Brockmann_Michael_Friedrich_Sabine_Kienitz_eds._Manuscripts_and_Archives_Comparative_Views_on_Record-Keeping_Studies_in_Manuscript_Cultures_11_._Boston_Berlin_2018_S.319-338); Byzantine culture always retained a clear, unbroken link to the classical past which gave a different flavor to the monastic libraries of the east compared to their western brethren, which were not infrequently additions to a cultural milieu quite disconnected from the Greco-Roman past.

The other thing to recall is that Josephus figured prominently in the religious controversies of the Late Roman period — so authors with a variety agendas found reasons to quote him. The most prominent quoters are [Origen](http://www.textexcavation.com/anaorigjos.html) (early 200’s) , [Porphyry ](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_abstinence_04_book4.htm)(mid 200’s), and [Eusebius](https://brill.com/view/title/8788) (early 300’s). These provide some check on the text but also illustrate the intractability of some differences between versions, as far back as Roman times.
