You’ll have a pretty dense crowd of competitors for the title, since so many emperors didn’t last long enough to leave much of a mark on Roman history.

By the time a would-be historian in Rome heard that, say, [Hostilian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostilian)had gotten the purple due to the deaths of his father and brother along the Danube, the young man was probably already dead thanks to his “co-emperor” [Trebonianus Gallus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebonianus_Gallus) — who himself only lasted on the throne for two years before his own death at the hands of his own troops. Everything know about many of these kinds of mayfly-emperors comes from later sources, often of dubious reliability. In the case of Hostilian and Gallus it’s the very abbreviated [Epitome de Caesaribus](http://www.roman-emperors.org/epitome.htm), written about a hundred and fifty years after the fact, and [Zosimus](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/zosimus/), writing in the sixth century. During the bad years of the third century, when at least [26 men claimed to be emperors in only fifty chaotic years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century), this kind of laconic evidence is quite normal. There must be at least a dozen emperors for whom the direct ancient written evidence would not amount to a 1,000 word student essay. For quite a few of them our only source is the [Historia Augusta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Augusta), a work so full of dubious documents and what appear to be authorial practical jokes that scholars use it only as a last resort.

What’s truly shocking from historiographical point of view is the lack of sources for [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan), widely regarded in Roman tradition as the most successful emperor after Augustus. _Sis felicior Augusto, melior Traiano,_ “May you be more blessed than Augustus and better than Trajan” was said to be the official wish of the Senate to the newly-enthroned emperors. Trajan planted a Roman eagle in the ruins of Babylon; he looted enough gold from the Dacians to throw a four month party for the entire city of Rome; he even [invented the shopping mall.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Market)

…and yet there is no contemporary history of his reign.

Our key existing source for his reign is a summary (written by a Byzantine monk) of a now-lost section of the works of [Cassius Dio ](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/cassius-dio/)who himself wrote more than a century after Trajan’s day. We have some literary work from his era, even a few [memos exchanged with Pliny the Younger](https://pages.pomona.edu/~cmc24747/sources/plin_6-10.htm#book10), and some [propagandistic puff-pieces from a Greek orator looking for work](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/1*.html). A single sentence quote from Trajan’s official account of the Dacian War survives in a grammatical text:

> _inde Berzobim, deinde Aizi processimus_ 

> _Then we proceeded to Berzobim, next to Aizi._ 

That’s it. There’s nothing like the detailed biographies of Suetonius, the elaborate set-pieces of Livy, or the moralizing of Tacitus to tell us about the most powerful Roman emperor of all time.

If it were not for his numerous coins and his very undeniable architectural heritage it would be easy for the Internet to decide he never existed. I’m afraid to google it.

_Trajan and his column, commemorating the victory over the Dacians which is detailed on the the monument and is probably the most detailed contemporary account of his reign._
