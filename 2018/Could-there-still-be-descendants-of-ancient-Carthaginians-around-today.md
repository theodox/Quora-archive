Absolutely yes — although the long lapse of time and at least two changes of language mean that it’s not likely anyone can actually trace a distinct family tree back to Carthage.

Although the [actual data](http://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(08)00547-8) is hellaciously complex, the layman’s summary is that a minimum of about 6% of the genetic ancestry of people in the coastal regions of Tunisia and Algeria includes markers from Phoenicia, thus from Carthage. The actual admixture is probably much higher than that, but the Phoenicians will have carried lots of genetic markers in common with other groups from the eastern Mediterranean, particularly Arabs: the 6% figure reflects only the genetic material that can’t be explained in other ways. Still it means that pretty much everybody in the old Carthaginian territories has at least some Carthaginian ancestors.
