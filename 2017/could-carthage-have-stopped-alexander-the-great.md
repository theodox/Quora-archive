It’s pretty unlikely.

Fourth century BC Carthage has its hands full with the Greek cities of Sicily. There had been on and off fighting between Carthage and Sicilian Greeks [for a long time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Wars), with a marked uptick in intensity from about 410 to 340 BC. The Carthaginians did end up dominant on the western side of Sicily, but they were never able to decisively defeat the most powerful of the Sicilian Greek states, Syracuse. Their most successful war against the Syracusans involved an alliance with the Greek cities of southern Italy, especially Taras (Tarentum) — it’s not clear that the Carthaginians could have won that round without that assistance.

_[Timoleon the Liberator](https://www.ancient.eu/Timoleon/)_ _beat the Carthaginians in Sicily with a smaller force about 10 years before Alexander arrived in Egypt_ 

As it was, the Carthaginians would fight the Syracusans again about 10 years after Alexander’s death. [Agathocles,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agathocles_of_Syracuse) the tyrant of Syracuse, launched an attack on the Carthaginian positions in Sicily which turned into a strange see-saw conflict where both sides nearly triumphed. First, he nearly overran the whole island — but then he was nearly annihilated. Finally he managed a last-ditch landing in North Africa which forced the Carthaginians to surrender and negotiate a favorable piece.

Perhaps more to the point, [Pyrrhus of Epirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_War#Sicilian_campaign_.28278-75_BC.29) brought a fairly up-to-date Macedonian-style army to Sicily (complete with elephants) in 278 BC. He drove the Carthaginians out of all of their island possessions except for Lilybaeum in the far west; however his political ineptitude and short attention span eventually derailed the project.

_[Pyrrhus “the eagle”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus)_ _beat the Romans at Asculum, and the Carthaginians in Sicily_ 

Pyrrhus was a talented general but he lacked Alexander’s drive and focus (certainly, his siege of Lilybaeum is laughable compared to Alexander’s attack on Tyre). If he was able to rock the Carthaginians so far back on their heels it’s unlikely they would have been very formidable to Alexander. Pyrrhus only brought about 8,000 horse and his elephants to Sicily — the rest of his army there were Sicilian Greeks. Alexander at the head of his full army — 40,000 in round numbers — was vastly more dangerous.

Alexander, in any case, would probably have posed a political challenge as well: while his [famous declaration of his own godhood at Siwa](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised) was aimed at an Egyptian audience, Siwa had a large Libyan population as well. Carthage at this point had not really integrated the Libyan population of its hinterland: they would rise in a large scale rebellion in the 240s. If they appreciated Alexander’s gesture at Siwa like the Egyptians did, the Carthaginians would have had a very serious political problem to match the military challenge.
