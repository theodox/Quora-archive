# When learning about the fall and decline of Ancient Rome, a feeling of sadness overcomes me. Maybe it’s because we live in a golden era ourselves and the idea of it all being lost is terrifying? What are your feelings regarding this topic?

It’s an old, old sentiment. The Romans had their dose of it too:

> At the sight of the city [Carthage] utterly perishing amidst the flames Scipio burst into tears, and stood long reflecting on the inevitable change which awaits cities, nations, and dynasties, one and all, as it does every one of us men. This, he thought, had befallen Troy, once a powerful city, and the once mighty empires of the Assyrians, Medes, Persians, and that of Macedonia lately so splendid. And unintentionally or purposely he quoted [Homer],—the words perhaps escaping him unconsciously,—

> _The day shall be when holy Troy shall fall
And Priam, lord of spears, and Priam's folk._ 

> And on my asking him boldly (for I had been his tutor) what he meant by these words, he did not name Rome distinctly, but was evidently fearing for her, from this sight of the mutability of human affairs. . .

from [Polybius, 39.5](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0234:book%3D39:chapter%3D5), on the destruction of Carthage.

But the feeling goes back much further. About 4000 years ago a Sumerian scribe wrote this about the ruins of Nippur, in Iraq:

> How did the true city become empty? Its precious designs have been defiled! How were the city's festivals neglected? Its magnificent rites have been thrown into disorder! In the heart of Nibru, where the divine powers were allotted and the black-headed people prolificly multiplied, the city's heart no longer revealed any sign of intelligence -- there where the Anuna used to give advice! In Ubšu-unkena, the place for making great judgments, they no longer impart decisions or justice!

> Where its gods had established their dwellings, where their daily rations were offered, their daises erected, where the sacred royal offering and the evening meal in their great banquet hall were destined for the pouring out of choice beer and syrup -- Nibru, the city where the black-headed people used to cool themselves in its spreading shade -- in their dwellings Enlil fell upon them as if they were criminals. It was he who sent them scattering, like a scattered herd of cattle. How long until its lady, the goddess Ninlil, would ask after the inner city, whose bitter tears were overwhelming?

> As though it were empty wasteland, no one enters that great temple whose bustle of activity was famous. As for all the great rulers who increased the wealth of the city of Nibru -- why did they disappear? For how long would Enlil neglect the Land, where the black-headed people ate rich grass like sheep? Tears, lamentation, depression and despair! How long would his spirit burn and his heart not be placated? Why were those who once played the šem and ala drums spending their time in bitter lamenting? Why were the lamenters sitting in its brick buildings? They were bewailing the hardship which beset them.

> The men whose wives had fallen, whose children had fallen, were singing "Oh our destroyed city!". Their city gone, their homes abandoned -- as those who were singing for the brick buildings of the good city, as the lamenters of wailing, like the foster-children of an ecstatic no longer knowing their own intelligence, the people were smitten, their minds thrown into disorder. The true temple wails bitterly.

A sense of the fragility of our accomplishments is healthy: a little cosmic humility is important if you want to retain your humanity, and not lose yourself if the fantasy that your politics or your religion our your race is the one that’s destined to stop the spinning wheel of time. As a poet of a very different Empire put it

> I met a traveller from an antique land,
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
_My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!_ 
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away

Shelly, [Ozymandias](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias)

The philosopher [Boethius](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/boethius/), who lived just after the Fall of Rome, did not just live in an era of great historical realignment, his personal life was beset with incredible ups and downs. His most famous work, _The Consolation of Philosophy_ , was written while he sat in prison awaiting execution. But he put these words into the mouth of Lady Fortune, the personification of chance in human affairs:

> Inconstancy is my very essence; it is the game I never cease to play as I turn my wheel in its ever changing circle, filled with joy as I bring the top to the bottom and the bottom to the top. Yes, rise up on my wheel if you like, but don't count it an injury when by the same token you begin to fall, as the rules of the game will require.
