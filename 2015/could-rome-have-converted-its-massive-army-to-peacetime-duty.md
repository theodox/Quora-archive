There's an unlikely assumption in the question: the Romans didn't get a 'peace dividend', because they didn't get much peace, particularly in the period after Diocletian.

_This map only tracks the_ ___successful___ _invasions of Roman territory: it doesn't include hundreds of cross-border raids, punitive expeditions, and other threats in the same period._ 

There was always pressure along the Rhine and Danube frontiers. Modern political solutions were not available, at least not on a permanent basis: the barbarian states over the frontier tended to be short-lived, coming and going with great rapidity and ambitious chieftains vied with each other for power: striking a treaty with [Athanaric](http://www.ancient.eu/Athanaric/) wouldn't protect you from [Fritigern](http://www.ancient.eu/Fritigern/) and vice versa. The Romans absolutely preferred diplomacy to force in this context: they maintained intense diplomatic and intelligence contacts with their neighbors, attempted to create cultural ties by educating the young barbarian nobles, and constantly intervened both overtly and covertly to support pro-Roman rulers. 

However, the basis of their security remained the threat of force. Most of their neighbors were societies led by warrior aristocrats whose status depended on success in battle. The Romans worked very hard to make sure they were the least tempting target in the area: if the Suebi want to go off and steal somebody's cattle, let's make it hard to get _ours_  and they'll go steal from the Cherusci instead. The Roman fortifications were not Chinese-wall style barriers: commercial and cultural contact throughout this period was common -- but, significantly, the Romans worked very hard to make sure that high-tech military gear like siege equipment or body armor did not fall into barbarian hands. But the fortified zones were an important trip wire: a way of clearly demarcating territory under Roman control and making sure than any incursion would be hampered or slowed long enough for a military response to form. (see [Ancient Rome: How did the Roman Empire lose Hispania?](https://www.quora.com/Ancient-Rome-How-did-the-Roman-Empire-lose-Hispania) for some context on how that fell apart)

Major battles were rare, because the Romans preferred to intervene ahead of time to break up or co-opt potential threats before they turned into actual invasions. Military superiority was expensive, and it clearly degreaded the quality of Roman life; but it was still cheaper than fighting big wars, and vastly cheaper than losing one. Even so, critical challenges emerged, on average, about once a generation. 

For Rome, the years from 250 to 476 were a long-running ancient version of the [Great Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game), a tense game of power politic punctuated by warfare. However this was rendered more complex by the fact that the real enemy wasn't a rival superpower: it was the perpetual pressure of new pastoral peoples pushing westward from the steppes of Eurasia: the [Volkerwanderung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Period) was not a single, mass movement of people at one point in time. Just like the contemporary [Jin dynasty ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_dynasty_(265%E2%80%93420))in China, Rome was trying to cope with a global-scale change in settlement (and possibly [climate change ](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1347917/Was-climate-change-responsible-rise-fall-Roman-Empire.html) as well). Its less remarkable that they lost out than that half of the empire held on for another thousand years (significantly, by perfecting the mixture of diplomacy, espionage and force that the was pioneered in this period).
