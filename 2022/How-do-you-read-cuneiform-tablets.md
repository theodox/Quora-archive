_Very carefully._ 

That’s not a joke; it’s just a reflection of the fact that cuneiform is [pretty tricky writing system to master](https://qr.ae/pvwM2x).

Cuneiform can encode several different languages — there 8 major ones¹ stretching over three millennia, during which orthography and scribal conventions changed many times. It’s a mix of syllabic and logographic writing in the same documents. Many texts were multilingual so you might think you were reading something in Akkadian for a few lines until you realized that the document was actually in Hurrian but you’d been reading a bunch of Akkadian loanwords interspersed with logograms.

Hence, cuneiform scholars generally take it _slow_ .

[This answer ](https://qr.ae/pvwMgR)details the mechanics in more detail, but essentially, what you do is transcribe first so you can check character-by-character to figure out how much of what you are seeing is being used syllabically and how much is (or at least, might be) logographic.

Unfortunately this is not always easy: most signs have multiple potential readings.

For example [the symbol 𒁺 usually transliterates as the syllable “du”.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%92%81%BA) But that’s just the most common use. [Du in Sumerian means “to go,” ](http://oracc.iaas.upenn.edu/epsd2/cbd/sux/o0026041.html)so a scribe might use the character as a shorthand for the idea of going without worrying about pronunciation, the way we might drop an arrow into the text to refer to something without worrying how it would be read aloud. But [the closely related Sumerian word ṭum is “bring”](http://oracc.iaas.upenn.edu/epsd2/cbd/sux/o0040612.html) — and Sumerians sometimes wrote it with the same character, so __𒁺__ might be “go” or “bring” or the sounds _du_  or _ṭum._ 

But let’s not stop there! the same character can also be the [Sumerian word gub](http://oracc.iaas.upenn.edu/epsd2/cbd/sux/o0028628.html) for “stand” — which might mean physically to “stand”, or metaphorically to “put” or “assign”.

So now we’re up to between six and twelve possible readings given all the uses of the logograms. And we’re not done with the first character, since sometimes a scribe who really wanted a consonant might just use the _d_  in _du_ or the _g_ in _gub_  (though Akkadian ears tended to turn it into “k”) or the hard t in _ṭum._ All up, this one character might mean one of about a dozen and a half different things. You’ll need more context to figure out which is the appropriate one. Of course, the odds are that the next character will be almost as rife with possible meanings as __𒁺.__ 

Did I mention that on top of all this, some scribal variants could use a different visual appearance for the mess of a given cuneiform character? All of those meanings for __𒁺__ might be written with 
𒄭. Or 𒆕.

In practice, the confusion is slightly less awful than I’m making it out to be. Although the three millennia of cuneiform history produced a lot of variants, those ancient scribes were human too: they didn’t make things harder than they had to be in a given context. As the millennia rolled on, predictable syllabic readings became more and more common so the mental gymnastics needed to go from symbols to potential uses to actual texts become less exhausting — and most of our texts come from this later, more predictable period. Also, some signs are [determinatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinative) — basically, helper symbols intended to help the reader pick the right variant of many alternatives. Above all, somebody who reads a lot of cuneiform will also be familiar with the scribal conventions for a given time and place so if they know where a given tablet comes from they’ll also be able to ignore some of unhelpful variants.

Nonetheless — if you meet a cuneiform scholar at your local pub, buy them a mug of barley wine. They’ve earned it.

Here’s typically great overview of the whole mess from the inimitable Irv Finkel of the British Museum. If you meet him, get him a whole case of barley wine.
