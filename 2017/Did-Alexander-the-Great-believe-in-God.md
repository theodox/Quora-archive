Alexander [claimed that he was a god.](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised) And Alexander definitely believed in himself — often to a fault.

It’s not clear how seriously he took his own claim; sometimes he passed it off as a joke with his closest companions — but eventually he had some of his closest associates killed for refusing to offer him divine homage. His mother [Olympias ](https://www.ancient.eu/Olympias/)was regarded as a fanatical devotee of Dionysus (and a lot of Greeks thought she was mad). She always maintained that he was the child of Zeus so it’s possible he really did believe it.

As for the sincerity of his beliefs in any other deities — he generally followed the public rituals of conventional Hellenic religion, with what seems to be sincerity. [Plutarch](http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/alexandr.html), anyway puts this sentiment into his mouth:

> Among the sayings of one Psammon, a philosopher, whom he heard in Egypt, he most approved of this, that all men are governed by God, because in everything, that which is chief and commands is divine. But what he pronounced himself upon this subject was even more like a philosopher, for he said God was the common father of us all, but more particularly of the best of us.

Overall, he’s probably best put in the same bucket as Julius Caesar and Napoleon, whose only real faith was an unshakable belief in their own destinies.
