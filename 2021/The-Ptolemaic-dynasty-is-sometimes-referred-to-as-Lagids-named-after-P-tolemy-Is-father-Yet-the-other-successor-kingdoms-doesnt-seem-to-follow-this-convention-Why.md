They did, sort of… it’s just that the eponymous ancestors were , so we start with the dynastic founders themselves: Seleucus Nicator gives us the Seleucids of Syria and Antigonus Monopthalmus gives us the Antigonids of Macedonia.

Antigonus’ father was a Philip, which would give us a Philipiad dynasty in Macedonia. It’s possibly avoided for the sake of uniqueness.

Seleucus’ father was an Antiochus so technically the dynasty could be an Antiochid dynasty — however there is also an Antiochid tribe at Athens (Socrates, for example, was in that tribe). Again, disambiguation points towards a different name among classicists.
