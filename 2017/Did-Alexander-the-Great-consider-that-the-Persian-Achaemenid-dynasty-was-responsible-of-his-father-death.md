THE murderer was a Macedonian, a royal bodyguard named Pausanias.

He had, it is said, a deeply personal motive. He had been first intoxicated and then gang-raped by the servants of a royal official named Attalus. When he accused Attalus before the king, Philip tried to buy him off with gifts and an appointment to the royal bodyguards. The influential Attalus, however, went unpunished. Thus, as Diodorus says, he became “ eager not only to exact vengeance from the perpetrator of his injury but also from the one who had declined to avenge him.”

Alexander had every reason to want this story taken at face value.

Alexander’s mother, Olympias, had been put away by Philip (who ended up with seven wives at one time or another). Philip had another young son — and potential heir —with a later wife. Unlike Olympias (a foreigner), the replacement wife was connected to the Macedonian aristocracy: Attalus was her uncle. Some ancient authors believed that Olympias was either behind the plot, or that she knew about it and chose not to warn the king.

Alexander himself was also suspected — when his half-brother was born he had had a very public falling out with his father which led him to flee the country. The fact that the assassin was killed by Alexander’s closest friends was seen by some as suspicious.

The actual truth behind the assassination has been debated for two millennia (there’s a great roundup here: [WHO KILLED PHILIP II? A FACT SHEET](http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~rauhn/Hist303/Philip_factsheet.htm)) Alexander, however, had no need to concoct a reason to go to war with Persia — Philip had already prepared an expedition of his own and _he_  certainly didn’t waste time on that sort of nicety.
