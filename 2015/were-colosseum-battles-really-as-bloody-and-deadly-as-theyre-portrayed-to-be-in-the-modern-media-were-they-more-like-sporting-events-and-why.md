# Were colosseum battles really as bloody and deadly as they're portrayed to be in the modern media, were they more like sporting events, and why?

There was a pretty strong distinction between three different kinds of public displays in the Arena. Two of these were pretty bloody.

The morning show was usually a _venatio_ , a hunt: an animal show. This was usually a slaughter of animals, often on a huge scale: Emperor Augustus boasted that his public entertainments accounted for 3500 rare African beasts (granted, over a long reign: but he wasn't the only one throwing games). In the late republic and early empire these were primarily focused on actual hunting, and the main victims were the animals or incautious professional handlers. Eventually it became common to include humans -- usually condemned criminals -- to allow the animals to even the score. The "throwing Christians to the Lions" stereotype reflects later Roman practice where increasingly novel and outlandish methods of public execution became more common.

In the middle of the day (often, in Italy, hot and lightly attended) the shows originally featured novelty acts and mock combats. You'd see oddball matches like women fighting dwarves, or naked slaves fighting with clubs mixed in with mimes and comedy acts. This was also a good time for elaborate productions like flooding the Colosseum to stage naval battles. While these could be deadly, the primary focus was on creating a stirring impression for the ambitious politician sponsoring the show.

Over time, this un-promising time slot became more and more dominated by public executions of condemned criminals. Sometimes these were deliberate exhibits of state terror: the Romans liked their punishments to be graphic and humiliating (in a world without TV or newspapers, novel forms of cruelty were a good way to spread word of mouth about how unwise it was to run afoul of the law). Forcing the condemned to fight as gladiators became increasingly common as time went on: purists, however, didn't like it. Seneca's famous description of a bad day at the arena is focused on the fate of the _noxii,_ the condemned, in the mid-day show:


> 
__I turned in to the games one mid-day hoping for a little wit and humor there. I was bitterly disappointed. It was really mere butchery. The morning's show was merciful compared to it. Then men were thrown to lions and to bears: but at midday to the audience. There was no escape for them. The slayer was kept fighting until he could be slain. "Kill him! flog him! burn him alive" was the cry: "Why is he such a coward? Why won't he rush on the steel? Why does he fall so meekly? Why won't he die willingly?" Unhappy that I am, how have I deserved that I must look on such a scene as this? Do not, my Lucilius, attend the games, I pray you. Either you will be corrupted by the multitude, or, if you show disgust, be hated by them. So stay away.__ 



 The gladiatorial shows proper, between trained professionals, were usually reserved for the afternoon 'main event'. At the high level these were (as some of the other answers point out) the gladiators were valuable professionals who weren't going to be lightly discarded. However reaching the upper ranks was dangerous and required experience fighting with less skilled, more erratic opponents at low level where fame was no protection; the sources discuss what rank a novice gladiator who died in his first fight was entitled to on his tombstone.

It was possible to survive a career as a gladiator and win manumission. Some survivors even boasted of having done so without killing anyone, though others boasted of their kill counts. Clearly some fighters managed longish careers of 20, 30 or even 50 bouts. But those were the ones who survived the fights in the lower ranks; the ones who died in their first or second battle didn't amass enough money for a tomb that an archaeologist could find; they were more likely to end up in the [rubbish dump](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1284496/Skeletons-80-gladiators-slaughtered-crowds-unearthed-York.html).

 However it was a dangerous job, and many tombs of gladiators killed at the height of their careers attest to the ever-present possibility of death. At the end of a fight the loser could be summarily killed or allowed to live based on the whims of the audience and the sponsor of the games -- while the crowds could be sentimental these were, after all, people who had warned up for the swordsmanship contest by watching people savaged by animals, burned alive, or torn to pieces by machinery: reliance on their kindlier sentiments was misplaced. Its not for nothing that Roman authors frequently cite gladiators not as celebrity heroes, but models of cold-eyed stoicism. Thus Cicero:



> Just look at the gladiators, either debased men or foreigners, and consider the blows they endure! Consider how they who have been well-disciplined prefer to accept a blow than ignominiously avoid it! How often it is made clear that they consider nothing other than the satisfaction of their master or the people! Even when they are covered with wounds they send a messenger to their master to inquire his will. If they have given satisfaction to their masters, they are pleased to fall. What even mediocre gladiator ever groans, ever alters the expression on his face? Which one of them acts shamefully, either standing or falling? And which of them, even when he does succumb, ever contracts his neck when ordered to receive the blow?



So: overall it was a bloody mess. The handful of professional for whom it was a career were a minority, compared to the luckless who were murdered in a variety of ways to delight the crowds or who didn't make it to the exalted ranks where their life or death mattered for more than an afternoon.
