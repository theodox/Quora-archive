No. Athens was far, far wealthier.

Athens was the center of a vast commercial network; Athenian shipping, Athenian pottery, and grain from Athens’ colonies in the Black Sea and Chersonesse brought in a lot of money. Moralists complained about Athenians’ lavish lifestyles; as Socrates said while walking through the Agora, “Behold how many things I do not need”.

It also helped that Athens was a maritime empire whose fleets controlled the Aegean. That gave it a cut of most of the commercial traffic in the region — but the Athenians also extracted money from a variety of subject states; the Parthenon was built by the Athenians using the money extorted from their empire.

Sparta, on the other hand, was a landlocked agricultural region which actively spurned trade and commercial activity. The Spartans[ deliberately made their currency inconvenient](http://encyclopedia-of-money.blogspot.com/2013/01/spartan-iron-currency.html) to use and store in order to discourage the accumulation of cash but also to hinder commercialism.

The result was widely acknowledged in antiquity. [Thucydides ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0247:book%3D1:chapter%3D10)put it best:

> If the Spartans’city were to become deserted, and only the temples and foundations of buildings were left, I think that the people of that time far in the future would find it difficult to believe that the Spartans’ power had been as great as their fame implied…. whereas if the same thing were to happen to Athens, from its visible remains one would assume that the city had been twice as powerful as it actually is.
