On the whole, no — though individual schools have a lot of flexibility in their curricula so there are exceptions here and there.

A typical high school curriculum will probably include Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece and Rome over the course of 2–3 months of calendar time: Perhaps 20 classroom hours for all four of these interesting cultures over 4000+ years: not enough for a lot of meaningful discussion or interaction.

It has to be extremely schematic, which makes it feel pretty dull. To my jaundiced way of of looking at it, modern American history teaching is done about as poorly as it can be done. It lacks the emotional impact of the “story” component of history while also skimping on the analytical and interpretive skills that make the subject more than entertainment.

I appreciate the premium which contemporary teaching styles want to place on interpretation and critical thinking —those are great skills to learn and incredibly valuable for students in a democracy. On the other hand the way those ideals are implemented in practice is rather sad. Students are given only a flimsy thematic overview of a lot of disjointed material. They don’t get either the immediacy that comes from old-fashioned narrative history or the interesting work of engaging with primary source material, so the “interpretation” they are able to do is extremely formulaic. You _do_ want a kid to have some kind of personal point of view about the subject matter: history’s more than memorizing names and dates. But an informed point of view is hard to come by when we’re zooming over the material at incredible speeds and with little feeling for its context. It’s the historical equivalent of a bus tour: 10 minutes at the Colosseum! Now 10 minutes in the forum! Back on the bus, then we’re off to Pompeii! It’s extremely rushed and very superficial.

To some degree, this is unavoidable in the US. As a multicultural country we have to at least make a gesture in the direction of including the history of the entire world in our teaching. On its own that’s a noble thing — but, given the demands on student time it has the unfortunate but predictable side-effect of producing globalized ignorance, not world citizens. The typical product is a paper-thin acquaintance with dozens of regional histories instead of any kind of competence in one or two. It _is_ fairer — but it’s also so watered down to the verge of pointlessness.

Ironically it’s the non-academic (and often very silly) pop-culture version of Rome that has the most impact on kids: a movie like _Gladiator_ or _Spartacus_  has a vastly bigger footprint in the average high-schooler’s view of history than anything their teachers have tried to do. It’s sometimes very frustrating (the movie 300 has a lot to answer for!) but at least it encourages curiosity and self teaching.

At the university level the situations is a bit better. Teachers at this level these days have to assume complete ignorance on the part of their students, so at least they tend to provide the necessary structure that the high school curriculum fails to provide. Unfortunately academic higher ed tends to be very inward-focused: the professors are often rushing students too — but in this case they’re short-changing the narrative material — what most ordinary folks think of as “history” — to get to the part that tends to interest professors: the details of source material, the infighting between different academic camps, and different schools of interpretation. This is all fine as far as it goes, but it doesn’t really spread the kind of casual cultural familiarity that establishes a historical point of reference in the larger culture.

In general I’d say the level of familiarity that a typical American college grad has for Roman material in particular today is significantly behind what a high school graduate of seventy five years ago would have known.
