Aristotle’s works predate modern books, so the originals don’t have conventional page numbers. They’re usually indexed by what’s known as the [Bekker Numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekker_numbering) system which refers back to the page in the standard 19th century edition used in the Prussian Academy of Sciences. The number there is the page number followed by an A or B (for the first or second column) and another number (the line number of the Greek text).

“Aristotle 1802” sounds like a Bekker number — however it’s off the end of the chart. The last work in the regular Bekker sequence is the _Poetics_ , ends at 1462b.

[Aristotle 1082](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D13%3Asection%3D1082a) (note swapped digits!) is in the Metaphysics; it’s a part of a discussion of the nature of numbers.
