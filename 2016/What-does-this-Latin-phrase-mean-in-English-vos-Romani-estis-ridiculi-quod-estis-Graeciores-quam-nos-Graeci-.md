“You Romans are silly, because you are Greeker than we Greeks.” seems like what it’s trying to say.

It doesn’t sound quite right to me, though — it sounds like it originated in some other language than Latin (maybe Greek, given the content? or maybe it’s a school text?) I think a Latin speaker would have found a workaround for _quod_  , because to a Latin speaker that could mean “because” (as above) or “who” — except in this case the _who_  is singular and _Romani_  is plural. Usually a Latin speaker would try to get around that kind of confusing juxtaposition.
