# What examples of relatives among Roman senators serving at the same time do we know? In particular, I am interested in examples of father and son serving as senators at the same time between 1 century BC and 1 century AD.

Familial groupings were so central to the way Roman politics that they[ spawned an entire sub-industry among Roman historians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopography_of_ancient_Rome). This approach — usually known as “prosopography” — emphasizes a careful study of the familial and social connections between famous figures as a way of tracing influences and alliances that don’t appear in political rhetoric.

Luckily for your project, prosopographists have created a searchable database at [The Digital Prosopography of the Roman Republic](http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/), which lets you search through known officeholders and will conveniently show you their closest relatives.

You’ll see there are a fair number of overlaps. Because wealthy, well established families had huge advantages in politics it was generally expected that each generation would end up in the Senate — though each year only had two consuls, the other elective magistracies also granted lifetime senate membership. In the first century every year elected 20 quaestors (40, after Caesar’s dictatorship), all of whom became senators for life* at the end of their term. This meant that there were at probably 9 ex-quaestors who never became consul for every successful politician who made it to the supreme office. Our sources are, of course, don’t have much to tell us about these back-benchers but efforts like the DPRR allow us to get some sense of how clannish and tightly packed the senate was.

The main obstacle to father-son pairings in the senate was really mortality — for most of the first century you had to be 30 to run for the quaestorate, so a father would have to live to see his son reach at least 30 if he hoped to share a bench with him in the curia. Since the average life expectancy in this era was in the low 50’s, surviving to see your son in full career was far from automatic. This was seen as a piece of very visible good fortune but it was not so surprising as to provoke much further comment.

For an example of a father-son pair here’s [Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Servilius_Vatia_Isauricus_(consul_79_BC)) who lived to the very respectable age of 90:

His son — [who bore the exact same name ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Servilius_Vatia_Isauricus_(consul_48_BC))— entered the Senate as a quaestor, probably just before 60 BC; father and son were senators together for the next 16 years. Isauricus’ own father had passed away before he joined the senate — but his elder brother Caius overlapped their father for a couple of years.* Isauricus lived to see his son become consul (in 48, during Caesar’s civil war)

This is not a particularly extreme example - it was not even especially shocking for brothers to be seated side-by-side. [Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnaeus_Domitius_Ahenobarbus_(consul_122_BC)), consul for 122, had two sons who were consuls only two years apart (Gnaeus in 96, Lucius in 94).

So — you should be able to find multiple examples of father-son senatorial pairs using the DPRR database. Unfortunately I don’t think there’s a complete searchable equivalent for the imperial period: the traditional version is the _[Prosopographia Imperii Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopographia_Imperii_Romani)_ _,_ but the online version only lets you enter names and get the PIR reference numbers, which are stock-in-trade for historians trying to distangle many generations of similarly named Romans. [The search page (in German) is here.](http://pir.bbaw.de/stichwortliste/stichwortliste-suchmaske) You can use the PIR numbers to help find things in the paper version or one of [the scanned online copies like this](https://archive.org/details/prosopographiai00dessgoog/page/n150/mode/2up).



* Isauricus shared the senate with at least one brother and possible another — you’ll note the question mark around M. Servilius above. Given the unimaginative Roman naming habits and the spotty records, confusions are not uncommon.
