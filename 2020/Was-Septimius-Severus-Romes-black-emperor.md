He’s definitely a Roman emperor, and he’s definitely an “African” — for a given value of African.

Septimius was born in Leptis Magna, today the city of [Al-Khums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khums) in Libya. His [mother’s family ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulvia_(gens))was originally from Italy. His [father’s family](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/septimius-severus/septimius-severus-ancestors/) was native to North Africa; they were part of the provincial aristocracy, tracing their roots back to the Carthaginian settler elite but probably also to the local [Numidian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numidia)or [Libyan ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Libya)upper classes. The Carthaginians originated in modern Lebanon; the Numidians are ancestral to the Berber population of today’s North Africa.

We don’t have any easy way of figuring out how much of Septimius’ ancestry is Punic and how much Numidian. The two groups had been intermarrying for a long time by Septimius’ day — the famous Hannibal had a Numidian brother-in-law three and a half centuries before Septimius was born — but we don’t have anything like statistical data that would let move past the level of guesswork. The Septimii definitely show Punic (that is, Semitic Carthaginian) names; for example the emperor’s great-great grandfather was “Gaius Phylessam” (similar to the Arabic name “Essam”) and his great-great granduncle Ba'alyaton Commodus. We know that Severus spoke Latin with a Punic accent. Interestingly, in later life he married a member of the royal family of [Emesa ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homs#Emesene_dynasty_and_Roman_rule)(modern Homs, Syria) — it conceivable that his Semitic-language roots had something to do with that connection, though the Emesene dynasty was thoroughly at home in Greek culture too.

Here’s an official portrait done during his lifetime:

So a lot depends on what you mean by “black”. Severus certainly didn’t look like a Swede or a Briton — or, for that matter, like a Ghanaian or an Ethiopian.

Severus’ ancestry was a mixture of Levantine and North African. What that means in terms of modern racial politics is, to say the least, complex. By his day, Punic culture had been established in North Africa for almost a thousand years; it’s quite unlikely that he was some sort of “pure” Levantine after than stretch of time. So, he’s almost certainly related to the ancestors of today’s Berbers. However a little checking around on Quora will show that modern Berbers don’t sort into a single, visually identifiable phenotype. Even the color picture is ambiguous, because Roman art [typically emphasizes light tones for women and dark tones for men.](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-ancient-Egyptians-paint-walls-with-men-in-a-darker-color-than-women-What-is-its-meaning/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=1e07a607&srid=zLvM) (it’s also a good idea to google image search ancient color images like this to see how much photography and lighting affect the outcomes).

What we can say for sure is that his contemporaries noticed his African roots the same way the recognized that say, Trajan and Hadrian came from Hispania — for them, the idea that he belonged to a different category of humanity just didn’t come up. The [Historia Augusta](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Septimius_Severus*.html), which is notorious for retailing salacious details, summed up his appearance like this:

> His clothing was of the plainest; indeed, even his tunic had scarcely any purple on it, while he covered his shoulders with a shaggy cloak. 8 He was very sparing in his diet, was fond of his native beans, liked wine at times, and often went without meat. In person he was large and handsome. His beard was long; his hair was grey and curly, his face was such as to inspire respect. His voice was clear, but retained an African accent even to his old age. After his death he was much beloved, for then all envy of his power or fear of his cruelty had vanished.

Severus’ reign furnishes does offer one peculiar reference to “race”: Cassius Dio, the Roman Senator who’s one of our best sources for Severus, tells the story [(75.8)](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/75*.html) of a soothsayer who predicted the outcome of a battle because of a dream featuring a “black man”:

> It seems that while Severus was in Pannonia the priest of Jupiter in a dream saw a black man ([μέλανα](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=me%2Flana&la=greek&can=me%2Flana0&prior=tina\)) force his way into the emperor's camp and come to his death by violence…

But the “black man” wasn’t Severus — it was his (entirely Italian) rival, [Pescennius Niger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pescennius_Niger), whose cognomen means “black”:

> …by interpreting the name of Niger people recognized that he was the black man in question.

Severus’ chief lieutenant in the war with Niger, incidentally, was [Tiberius Claudius Candidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Claudius_Candidus) — whose cognomen means “white” or “fair skinned.”



It’s also worth pointing out that Severus is _not_ the only emperor with an African background (even if you discount his sons, Geta and Caracalla, and his nephews-by-marriage Elagalabus and Alexander Severus).

[Macrinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus) (reigned 217–218) was born in Mauretania Caesariensis, the coastal part of modern Algeria. He seems to have come from the same kind of background as Severus — wealthy, Punic or mixed Punic-Berber, and well entrenched in the imperial service aristocracy of bureaucrats and soldiers. He was a talented lawyer (North Africans had a reputation in antiquity for sharp tongues and tenacious arguments). He rose to prominence under Severus — probably because of local connections, but we can’t be sure — and ended up taking power by conniving at the assassination of Severus’ son Caracalla. It’s probably significant that criticism of Macrinus during his (brief) term in office had nothing to do with his racial background — nobody cared he was a Mauretanian, but the Senatorial aristocracy wasn’t very pleased by the fact that he tended to favor upper-middle-class provincial bureaucrats like himself rather than the Italian aristocracy: he was a class outlier rather than an ethnic one.

Here’s Macrinus. Some statues have pierced ears, and some art historians think that’s a specifically North African thing.:

We know less about [Aemilianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aemilianus), who was emperor for about three months during the summer of 253 — but we do know he was a North African. One source identifies him as a [Maurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauri) — the word that’s the origin of “Moor” in English and “Moro” in Spanish. The other describes him as a Libyan. Both of these are branches on the family tree of today’s Berbers. Typically the homeland of the Mauri was in the Atlas mountains between today’s Algeria and Morocco, but his birthplace was in [Djerba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djerba), Tunisia, farther to the east.

Here’s how Aemilianus presented himself on his coins — as you can see, the likeness isn’t well established so it’s hard to rely on it for much:

Roman Africa produced a lot of mosaic art — unlike almost any other aspect of ancient art it actually does provide a lot of information that’s suggestive of skin color. The mosaics showcase a lot of the complexity and diverse mix of peoples that Severus would have been familiar with; [this collection of images from the Tunisian National Museum at Bardo is a great introduction.](https://www.romeartlover.it/Bardo.html)
