"Lower class" is a tricky thing to define if you're royal. In many royal houses the line is really drawn between royals and everyone else: a really haughty royal house like the Hapsburgs was almost as upset by the marriage of Archduke Franz Ferdinand -- of WWI fame, and heir to the imperial throne -- and [Sophie Teschen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie,_Duchess_of_Hohenberg) (a mere countess) as they would have been by a marriage with an ordinary person. 

There is a longish list in the wiki article on [Morganatic marriage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morganatic_marriage). 

Still, to my mind the all-time champion would have to be Françoise d'Aubigné, [Madame de Maintenon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise_d%27Aubign%C3%A9,_Marquise_de_Maintenon): the second wife of that most haughty of monarchs, [Louis XIV ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France)

Her father was a convict (though to be fair he was a political prisonser) and she may have been born in prison -- conjugal visits were more of a thing in those days. She definitely grew up in poverty. 

Her first lucky break was to attract the eye of Paul Scarron, a poet who was 25 years older than herself -- although he was unhealthy he introduced her to Parisian literary society. There she met one of King Louis' many mistresses, [Madame de Montespan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise-Ath%C3%A9na%C3%AFs,_marquise_de_Montespan), who eventually took her on as a nanny for her and the king's illegitimate children -- Scarron having died, she was poor again and needed work. Due to the secrecy surrounding the affair, Françoise did most of the work herself, without the squads of housekeepers and maids expected in polite society. At this time she was about 35.

Whatever his faults as a husband, Louis was fond of his children and spent a great deal of time with them. He grew fond of Françoise and came to respect her judgement and care for the royal bastards. Unlike pretty much anyone else in France, he permitted her to speak freely to him and to ignore the elaborate rules of protocol that bound even the highest members of French society. 

As he came to admire Françoise, he gave her a title and a healthy income. When the children were publicly legitimized in 1675 he brought her to court. More importantly, he fell in love with her -- not an elderly king swooning over a pretty girl, but a match between two mature people in their 40's. Eventually, they became lovers and in 1683, after the death of queen Marie-Therese, they were secretly married. Despite the 'secrecy' of their liason she was widely regarded as the most powerful person in France after the King, sometimes known as the "prime minister".
