Back of the envelope:

Great pyramid = 2.3 million blocks, averaging 2.3 metric tons each ([NOVA Online/Pyramids/Scaling the Pyramids/Blocks](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/pyramid/geometry/blocks.html))

total weight: 5.29 million metric tons

one ton per mile: 39 cents ( [Freight Transport Costs per Ton-Mile (in 1995 dollars)](https://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch3en/conc3en/modaltransportcosttonmile.html) plus [CPI Inflation Calculator](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=25&year1=1995&year2=2014)

so $ 2,063,100 _per mile_  transport costs alone. A lot depends on how close your quarry is! Pick a site with lots of good quarries close by.

The original labor force is estimated at 400,000 man-years ([The Private Lives of the Pyramid-builders](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/pyramid_builders_01.shtml)). How much more efficient are we? At $31,000 per year in Arizona ( [Construction Worker Salary in Arizona](http://www.indeed.com/salary/q-Construction-Worker-l-Arizona.html)) you've got (31,000 * 400,000) or $12,400,000,000 divided by whatever increased productivity number you plug in. If we're 100 times more productive your labor force is only $124 million! But if we are only 10X more efficient it's $1.24 billion. Hint: negotiate hard on your contracts!

There's also taxes and benefits. In the US non-wage employment costs are usually about 40% over the costs of wages, so multiply the results of your wage costs times 1.4. If it's a government contract it will be more like 56% over wages, so multiply by 1.56 ([Page on bls.gov](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecec.pdf))

Don't forget regulatory costs! "Large employers" - and 400,000 is a big work force - are $13,750 per employee ([The Cost of Federal Regulation](http://www.nam.org/Data-and-Reports/Reports/Cost-of-Federal-Regulations/The-Cost-of-Federal-Regulation/)) So you have to multiply that by the number of employees you decided on: somewhere between 4,000 ($55 million) or 40,000 ($550 million). 400,000 years worth of workman's comp is pricey!

Evidently Arizona is the [most corrupt state in America](http://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/measuring-illegal-and-legal-corruption-american-states-some-results-safra). Being originally from Rhode Island I find that _hard_ to believe. However you'd better budget something for greasing those palms - say 10%? [Global Corruption Report 2009](http://issuu.com/transparencyinternational/docs/global_corruption_report_2009/39?e=0). Multiply the total project cost by 1.1 if you don't want to get bogged down in inspections, permitting delays, and regulatory blockages.

You'll need lots of equipment. If this is a for-profit venture you can buy new or used equipment and take a depreciation on the taxes. Otherwise you may be able to rent. A Backhoe will run you between $2000 and $3000 per month (remember, though, it's replacing lots of peasants with pickaxes!) A wheel loader is about $4500 per month. The D-Day landing involved 148,000 vehicles per month to service about a 800,000 men; so lets say the equivalent of 1 vehicle per 6 workers calculated above, at an average of about $3,500 per month. However, higher productivity probably means more vehicles: so if you're assuming the 4,000 workforce, go with 1 vehicle per 3 workers. Low estimate: 4,000 /3 * 3,500 = $ 4,666,666 in rentals per month. High estimate = 40,000 / 6 * 3500 or $23,333,333 per month.

It's Arizona! It's hot. You'll need lots of water! At least 64 ounces per day per worker if you want to keep them healthy. A pallet of [Nestle Pure Life Purified Bottled Water - 1/2 liter (16.9 oz) - 72 Case Pallet](http://www.samsclub.com/sams/nestle-pure-life-purified-bottled-water-1-2-liter-16-9-oz-72-case-pallet/prod3160428.ip) will supply 400 workers for a mere $500.... per day. So budget between $5,000 and $50,000 per day ($100,000 to $1,000,000 per month) for water.

Obviously you'll want to keep those monthly costs down - but if you use a lot of over time you'll have to pay time and a half!

You'll also need to hire a lot of specialists to do the decorating. At the very least you should get a copy of [Graphic Artists Guild Handbook : Pricing & Ethical Guidelines (Graphic Artists Guild Handbook of Pricing and Ethical Guidelines, 10th Edition): Graphic Artists Guild: 9780932102119: Amazon.com: Books](http://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Artists-Guild-Handbook-Guidelines/dp/0932102115) so you can negotiate a fair work-for-hire contract with your scribes and muralists. You may also need the services of an [So, Art Lawyer](http://clancco.com/wp/2014/06/art_lawyer_law_sergio_munoz_sarmiento/) - the last thing you want is your eternal resting place being caught up in a DMCA takedown or copyright lawsuit!
