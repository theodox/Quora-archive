Many, many times.

The Romans and various Persian states were rivals for almost seven hundred years, and there were plenty of changes of fortune during that time. These wars were usually focused on the borderlands, particularly buffer states like Armenia; however there were several times when Parthian or Persian armies penetrated into Roman territory:

__51 BC__ 

The year after their their tremendous victory at [Carrhae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carrhae) the Parthians launched a full scale invasion of Roman Syria. This was defeated by [Cassius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Cassius_Longinus), the future assassin of Julius Caesar.

__40 BC__ 

In the civil war that followed Caesar’s death, the Parthians supported Brutus and Cassius against Antony and Octavian. In 40 they invaded Roman Syria and the Levant in alliance with Republican holdout [Quintus Labienus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Labienus), but they were pushed back the following year by [Publius Ventidius Bassus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Ventidius_Bassus).

__161__ 

The Romans and Parthians continued to fight for another two centuries. Most of subsequent wars were in Armenia and Mesopotamia. The last Parthian invasion of Roman territory came after a Roman defeat in Armenia in 161.

The [Sasanian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire) which replaced the Parthians in the third century was much more aggressive — and it’s rise coincided with a long and damaging series of Roman civil wars: there were 35 emperors between the years 235 and 285.

__232__ 

Sassanid emperor [Ardashir I ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardashir_I)began raiding Roman territory in 230, culminating in a full-blown invasion in 232. A Roman counteroffensive under [Severus Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severus_Alexander) in Armenia compelled a Persian withdrawal.

__238__ 

Ardashir invaded again in 238, after Severus was murdered.

__243__ 

Ardashir’s successor [Shapur I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapur_I) invaded the Roman territories of northern Mesopotamia. Roman emperor Gordian III was killed leading the Roman counter-offensive, and the Romans were forced to sue for peace.

__253__ 

The Romans were also beset by serious problems on the Balkan frontier (as well as ongoing civil conflicts). Shapur conquered Armenia and also attacked Roman territory, sacking Antioch.

__260__ 

Shapur invaded Roman territory again, defeating and capturing Roman emperor Valerian at the [battle of Edessa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Edessa), one of the greatest disasters in Roman military history. An improvised defense force, led by the Roman client king of Palmyra, drove the Persians off.

__296__ 

Another conflict over Armenia led to an attack on Roman territory at Carrhae. The Roman army — reinvigorated by the reforms of [Diocletian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian)— made a major counterstroke into Mesopotamia and settled the frontier for a generation.

__330’s__ 

[Shapur II ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapur_II)unsuccessfully attacked the Roman frontier fortress at Nisibis several times in the 330’s during more fighting in Armenia.

Fighting over Armenia continued on and off into the 380’s, after which both empires turned their attention to barbarian threats on other borders for a long while.

__502__ 

Persian king [Kavadh I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavadh_I) attacked Roman territory in an effort to extort money he needed to pay off the Huns.

__525–530__ 

The serious war between [Khosrow I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosrow_I) and [Justinian I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I) involved a number of Persian attacks on Roman territory.

__540–545__ 

Worried by the unexpectedly fast Roman recovery from the previous war, Khosrow invaded Roman Syria in 540, kicking off five more years of see-saw warfare

__571–578__ 

After a Roman invasion of Mesopotamia fell apart thanks to politics, the Persian counterattack reached Roman Syria and Anatolia. Reciprocal raiding went on for several years.

__603–629: The Final War__ 

When the Roman general [Phocas ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocas)rebellled against his emperor, the Persians supported a legitimist rival and invaded the Roman east to put him on the throne. They began to systematically reduce the Roman frontier fortresses and roll up Roman garrisons in the Caucasus.

In 610 the Roman governor of Africa, [Heraclius ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclius)rebelled against Phocas but had to immediately turn his attention to the Persians. The Persians won a resounding victory in 613, which gave them command of Roman Syria and Palestine; over the next 10 years they would reach Egypt, Rhodes, and the interior of Anatolia — their greatest success in 700 years of Persian-Roman warfare.

Heraclius struggled to rebuild his army, fend off the Slavs and Avars in the Balkans, and to finance a counterstroke.

Finally, in 623 he struck at Persia through the Caucasus, beginning a long and hard-fought campaign down into Mesopotamia. By 629 he had reversed all of the Persian gains, scoring the ultimate victory in the epic war between the two great powers.

Unfortunately for both, the exhaustion and chaos left by a generation of bitter warfare laid the Romans and the Persians open to the newly united, aggressive, and inspired forces of Islam.
