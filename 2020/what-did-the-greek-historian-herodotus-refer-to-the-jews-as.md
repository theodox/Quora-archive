“Syrians who practice circumcision.” At least, [here’s what he says (2.104)](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/2B*.html):

> the Colchians and Egyptians and Ethiopians are the only nations that have from the first practised circumcision. The Phoenicians and the Syrians of Palestine acknowledge of themselves that they learnt the custom from the Egyptians

And the Jewish historian Josephus, writing about five centuries later, interpreted that as a reference to Jews [(Contra Apionem, 1.22)](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/apion-1.html)

That’s it. For what it’s worth Ἰουδαῖος (“Judaean” or “Jew”, depending on context) doesn’t show up in Greek until a few centuries after Herodotus.
