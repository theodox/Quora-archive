They’d have a very hard time recognizing it as a version of their own lives and careers.

The sizzle-to-reality ratio in those films asymptotically approaches infinity. There’s an entire cottage industry here on Quora of people pointing out the myriad inaccuracies involved. I’ll leave the business of following up that vast genre to the reader.

But, putting aside the innumerable errors in detail (_no, the Persian empire was not founded in a coke-fuelled orgy celebrating the release of a Grace Jones album; no, Artemisia didn’t have flamethrowers; and no, Xerxes did not glow in the dark_ ) there is a fundamental issue with the ___tone___ of the movies and the comic on which they are based that would remain even if the whole thing were combed over by a squad of diligent historical re-enactor types fact-checking the cut of every sandal.

Frank Miller’s original comic, not unlike his _Dark Knight_ , was founded on a kind of primitive amazement at the sheer animal quality of hand-to-hand battle. It’s a fundamentally _hormonal_ view of conflict, with an emphasis on guts in both senses of the word. It’s a self-contained aesthetic that works as a piece of art on its own — in the comparatively sanitized world of comics 20 years ago, where literal guts were in short supply despite megaton-sized punches being routine comic fodder, it was kind of striking. But as far as the events of 480 BC go, the nicest thing you could say would be “inspired by a true story” — again, forgoing criticism of details the _feeling_ is entirely wrong.

In Greek, the animal side of battlefield greatness is best summed up as _[thumos](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/got-thumos/)_ _,_ a word which is lamely translated as “spiritedness.” but might best be summed up as “power” or even “rage”. _Thumos_ is all over Homer, you can often find his heroes gearing themselves up for battle by talking to their own _thumoi;_ in later Greek (including all over the New Testament) willingness or readiness is _[prothumeia](https://biblehub.com/greek/4288.htm)_ _,_ literally “putting your _thumos_ out front.”

But — and here’s what Frank Miller chose to omit — Greek tradition didn’t regard _thumos_ as an unmixed good. Greek thought was very, very concerned with discipline, and self command. _[Epithumeia](https://www.messie2vie.fr/bible/strongs/strong-greek-G1939-epithymia.html)_ — another derivative of _thumos —_ is “shameful desire”, “lust”, or “fixation”; it means your _thumos “_ stuck on something.” So beserker rage, no matter how impressive on its own in a society which openly admired “manliness”, was not something a proper Greek could approve of. [Plato's theory of the soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_theory_of_soul) was centered on primacy of reason (_logos)_ over the useful but also potentially dangerous and disruptive _thumos._ The hormonally-charged Miller hero, bellowing like a gorilla, swollen with defiance, would have horrified any Greek gentleman, Themistocles and Leonidas particularly. They’d have looked at those characters on screen and seen not rational Hellenes, but quintessential __barbarians__ .

I’m pretty sure Leonidas would react negatively to the histrionics. Spartans were famously low-key; they preferred businesslike deliberation to he-man posturing. Although many of them are almost certainly spurious[, the quotes that Plutarch attributed to Leonidas ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Sayings_of_Spartans*/main.html)are a good place to look for inspiration. Miller kept a few of the good quotes: “Then we shall fight in the shade!”,“come get them!”, and even “tonight we dine in Hell!” But he missed the ones that the Greeks loved best: the ones which showed Leonidas deliberately and rationally placing himself in harm’s way for the cause, with no phony optimism about the outcome:

> When they said, "Have you decided to do anything else but to keep the barbarians from passing?" "Nominally that," he said, "but actually, expecting to die for the Greeks."

> When someone said, "Leonidas, are you here to take such a hazardous risk with so few men against so many?" he said, "If you men think that I rely on numbers, then all Greece is not sufficient, for it is but a small fraction of their numbers; but if on men's valour, then this number will do." When another man remarked the same thing he said, "In truth I am taking many if they are all to be slain.”

and lastly

> Being asked why the best of men prefer a glorious death to an inglorious life, he said, "Because they believe the one to be Nature's gift but the other to be within their own control."

As for Themistocles: he’d probably just laugh. That man was as slippery as an eel (_though not because he was doused with gel like the cast of_ 300_)_ . The real Themistocles, when he was an exile with a price on his head at Athens as well as in Persia, had himself smuggled into the Persian court in order to demand the price on his own head from the king’s own hand; he parlayed that bit of chutzpah into a job as a Persian governor in Asia Minor. It would amuse that unflappable operator no end to be turned into a chest-thumping muscleman. He’d probably share a good chuckle with Artemisia about how they both ended up portrayed on screen: in real life she too, was famous for her cleverness and not for skill with a sword or a bow. The only reason we know about her at all is that when the Persian fleet was disintegrating at Salamis, she deliberately rammed and sank an allied Persian galley, convincing the Greeks that she was on their side and allowing her to escape — a trick that the real Themistocles would have been proud to claim for himself.

The real story of Leonidas is best told in [Herodotus book 7 (starting at chapter 201)](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/7D*.html); [Herodotus book 8 (starting at chapter 40)](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/8B*.html) covers Themistocles at Salamis, and[ Plutarch’s biography of him](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Themistocles*.html) shows him in all his glorious trickery.
