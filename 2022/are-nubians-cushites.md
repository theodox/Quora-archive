Unfortunately the verbiage is a bit confusing. An ethnic Kushite comes from the geographic region we’d call Nubia, but a geographic Nubian is not necessarily and ethnic Kushite. Both _Nubian_ and _Cushite_ (more often these days, _Kushite_ with a K) refer to the same general region, the Nile Valley of modern Sudan. However that region has several millennia of history covering several different states and sets of people.

_Kush is_  the local name of the civilization which dominated the Nile Valley from the borders of Egypt down to the vicinity of modern Khartoum. That name, or variants of it, are used by Egyptian, Assyrian, and local records — the oldest written use of it comes from the reign of Egyptian pharaoh [Mentuhotep II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentuhotep_II), just before 2,000 BC. Inscriptional evidence from Kushite records the name as _Qos_ in the local language we call [Meroitic](http://qes, qos). In modern usage its conventional to say “Kingdom of Kush” but not always accurate: the archaeology suggests that at different points in this long stretch of time Kush was sometimes a unitary state and sometimes divided into what look like city-states. The three main Kushite cities — [Kerma,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerma) [Napata ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napata)and [Meroë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB) — all [served as capitals at different time](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/kingdoms-kush/).

_Kush_  continues in use for something over two millennia. Intermittently, the region was dominated by Egypt; at other times it was independent. The Kushite [25th dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt) which conquered Egypt in the 8th century BC was founded by a king the Egyptians knew only as _[Kashta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashta)_ _,_ ie, “the Kushite,” who ruled from Napata; his descendants [Piye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piye) and [Shebiktu ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebitku)went on to conquer all of Egypt. The Biblical _Cush, son of Ham,_ gets his name from Kush (of which he’s supposed to be the ultimate ancestor); in Aramaic or Hebrew it was common to use _Kush_  up to the 5th century. In Greek and Latin, however, it was more common to say _Ethiopia,_ a vague term that indicated any place inhabited by dark-complected people.

The English word _Nubian_  comes from Latin. It’s usually said to be derived from the national names of a group that settled the regions south of the Egyptian border during the later Roman empire.* The [Nobatae ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobatia)were nomads from the Western Desert who allied with the Roman rulers of Egypt against a different nomadic group, the [Blemmyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blemmyes#:~:text=The%20Blemmyes%20(Ancient%20Greek%3A%20%CE%92%CE%BB%CE%AD%CE%BC%CE%BC%CF%85%CE%B5%CF%82,until%20the%208th%20century%20AD.&text=The%20Blemmyes%20are%20usually%20identified,that%20flourished%20in%20Late%20Antiquity.). They ended up ruling the northern part of the former Kushite territory in the 4th century, after the last Kushite kingdom declined. Their language, known as “[old Nubian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Nubian),” is ancestral to the modern [Nubian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubian_languages).

Our understanding of the relationship between the older Meroitic language and Old Nubian isn’t great and there are a lot of competing theories about the degree of affinity between the Nobatae and their Meroitic-speaking Kushite predecessors.

So to try to straighten things out:

In modern usage ___Nubia___ refers geographically to the whole Nile valley from Aswan in Egypt to Khartoum. Used of people it can either mean “inhabitants of the Nubian region” or, more specifically, the several [Nubian ethnic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubians) who do (or did, until Arabized) speak Nubian languages.

___Kush___ and ___Kushite___ are more properly reserved for the state and people of the same general region before the fall of the last Kushite kingdom, [Meroë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB), around the 4th century. The Kushite states used the __Meroitic__ language in historic times, although they were also literate in Egyptian and used Egyptian hieroglyphics as well as their own script.

_Kush_ can also be used geographically for roughly the same region describe by _Nubia_ 



* The _Nobatae->Nubia_ etymology is sometimes disputed. The hieroglyphic Egyptian word for gold is _nb (noub_  in Coptic)_,_ so perhaps the Nobatae got their name from that — or, perhaps, the Egyptians used a foreign name for gold: they got a lot of theirs from farther up the Nile. A third possibility is that _Nobatae_  shares a root with the name of the Kushite city at _Napata._ In any case, however, outsiders don’t start referring to the region as _Nubia_  until the late Roman period, when the Nobatae (and a group known as the Noba, who might be a separate people or might be a different way of referring to the same group) were dominant in the region.
