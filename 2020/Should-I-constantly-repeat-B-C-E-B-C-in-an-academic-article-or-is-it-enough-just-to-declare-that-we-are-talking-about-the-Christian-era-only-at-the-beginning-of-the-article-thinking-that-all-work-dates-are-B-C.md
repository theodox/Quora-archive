# Should I constantly repeat "B.C.E / B.C" in an academic article or is it enough just to declare that we are talking about the Christian era only at the beginning of the article, thinking that all work dates are B.C.?

Some academic publications (or, more rarely, some undergraduate programs) will have style guides which cover this, if you’re writing for publication it’s a good idea to find out if there is a guide and use it.

That said, if the context provides a pretty clear distinction it’s not common to constantly repeat qualifiers. For example an article about the Peloponnesian war (430–404 BC) will most likely throw in a couple of ‘establishing’ qualifiers early but dispense with them later on: Here’s a random grab from Donald Kagan to illustrate the point:

> The Spartan attitude reflected an important fact about the condition of the Greek world from 479 to 461: Its stability was apparent only and not real. The alliance between Sparta and Athens was not an alliance of states but of factions.

Generally the qualifiers will show up either when you’re covering a set of events that span both eras — the bane of biographers of emperor Augustus, for example — or if you have to refer to sources or relevant external developments outside the numeric series that dominates the article.

A personal quirk of mine — I’ve never seen it explicitly documented as a “standard” — covers discussing centuries or millennia. I personally have a hard time making myself write “the fifth century” when I mean “the fifth century BC” even in a context where the conclusion is obvious. I wouldn’t however dignify that with the status of a rule.
