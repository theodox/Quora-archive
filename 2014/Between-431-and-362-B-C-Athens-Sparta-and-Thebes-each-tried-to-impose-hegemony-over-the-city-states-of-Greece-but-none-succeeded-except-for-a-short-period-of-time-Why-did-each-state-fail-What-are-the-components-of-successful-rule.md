# Between 431 and 362 B.C., Athens, Sparta, and Thebes each tried to impose hegemony over the city-states of Greece, but none succeeded except for a short period of time. Why did each state fail? What are the components of successful rule?

As the other answers pointed out, Greece - especially in the period you're asking about - was terrible at managing social cohesion. 

 Even external threats were not enough to keep the Greeks working together - if you read Herodotus' account of the Persian War, for example, you'll see that not only did many of the cities go over to the Persians without a fight (often in order to try to enlist them against local rivals), even the forces which stayed loyal to the idea of Hellas were full of rivalries and backstabbing (Themistocles at Salamis, for example, forestalling the efforts of the Corinthian contingent to retreat by informing the Persians of their plans, while simultaneously threatening to abandon the alliance in order to blackmail the Spartan admiral into fighting is the most vivid - but not the only! - example of how poorly coordinated the supreme act of Hellenic cooperation was.

In the case of both Athens and Sparta, the effort to achieve hegemony over the rest of Greece was seriously compromised by the gradual evolution of their international rivalry into an ideological competition. Both cities found it easier to make alliances with cities that had social systems like their own, so most of the time Athens encouraged democracies and populist republics, while Sparta preferred to ally with oligarchs and old-line aristocrats. Ideology was not the only driving force in the conflicts -- Athens, for example, attacked Syracuse, even though the latter was also a democracy; Sparta warred with aristocratic Thebes, etc -- but the overlap of inter-city poltics and intra-city politics made the period of Spartan-Athenian conflict particularly vicious, since conventional military battles intermingled with civil wars throughout the Greek world. Thucydides summation of the civil war in Corcyra (which started the Peloponessian war) sums it up too well:



> Thus every form of iniquity took root in the Hellenic countries by reason of the troubles. The ancient simplicity into which honour so largely entered was laughed down and disappeared; and society became divided into camps in which no man trusted his fellow...

> Meanwhile Corcyra gave the first example of most of the crimes alluded to; of the reprisals exacted by the governed who had never experienced equitable treatment or indeed aught but insolence from their rulers- when their hour came; of the iniquitous resolves of those who desired to get rid of their accustomed poverty, and ardently coveted their neighbours' goods; and lastly, of the savage and pitiless excesses into which men who had begun the struggle, not in a class but in a party spirit, were hurried by their ungovernable passions. In the confusion into which life was now thrown in the cities, human nature, always rebelling against the law and now its master, gladly showed itself ungoverned in passion, above respect for justice, and the enemy of all superiority; since revenge would not have been set above religion, and gain above justice, had it not been for the fatal power of envy.



Militarily this meant that every conquest was temporary, since the defeating a regime only added to the swarms of embittered exiles throughout the Greek world, always looking for an excuse to return to power and take revenge on their local enemies. Regardless of who won the formal battles, the perpetual civil strife weakened all sides and made for chaotic, shifting patterns of alliance the could change very quickly based on unpredictable local conditions. A democratic or oligarchic revolution in a fairly minor city could start a chain reaction as related factions tried to capitalise on the new situation. Thus neither Athens nor Sparta could rely on their allies and subjects very well, and in the end they exhausted themselves trying to manage this impossible situation.

The Theban hegemony is a slightly different. It rested very heavily on the military genius of Epanimondas, and when he was killed at Mantinea Thebes was left as merely a powerful, but not a dominating force in Greece. The Thebans didn't foster the same kind of ideological conflicts that the Athenians and Spartans did and so the politics of this period are driven more by classical balance-of-power concerns than by social strife (although it's true that the traditional animosity between Theban aristocrats and Athenian democrats is one reason why the Thebans were unable to completely break Spartan power -- the Athenians didn't like the Spartans much, but didn't feel much fondness for their traditional local rivals either).
