Sextus just means 'sixth son.' It remained in use as long as the [tria nomina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions) or three-name system was used, though that system went into decline starting around the fourth century.

The Romans book of baby names was extremely short by modern standards: [there were only a couple of dozen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions#Praenomen) personal names to pick from and many of these were simply numbers. Among familiar Roman names in this batch are _Quintus. Sextus, Septimus, Octavius, Nonus,_ and _Decimus; i.e._ numbers 5 through 10. 

Even more unromantic is _Postumus_ , which is typically given to children whose father died before their birth.
