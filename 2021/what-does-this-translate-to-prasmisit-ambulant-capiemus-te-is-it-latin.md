It’s _almost_  Latin.

__Prasmisit__  isn’t a Latin word, the closest real world would probably be _[praemisit](https://latin-dictionary.net/definition/31293/praemitto-praemittere-praemisi-praemissus)_ _, “he/she/it sent ahead”._ 

__Ambulant__ ______ is “they walk”, from [ambulo](https://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/ambulo).

__Capiemus te__  is “we will catch you”, from the verb [capio](https://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/capio).

unfortunately it’s not a full sentence — it’s got three verbs each with a different subject (he/she/it, they, and we) so there’s not way to untangle it except as “He sent ahead. They walk. We will catch you.”
