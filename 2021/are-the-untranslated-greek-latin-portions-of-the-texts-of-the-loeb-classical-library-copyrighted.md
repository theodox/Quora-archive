They generally would be, since the text is the result of editorial decisions made by the scholars who put the text together. Given the rather aggressive paywalling that Harvard does around the Loebs, I would expect they would defend the copyrights as well.

On the other hand you can come up with your own edition of the text by looking at the editions the Loeb editors used — most of those will be 19th century work and in the public domain by now. There are also newer critical editions than the Loebs, so they would be a good place to start.

Producing a real critical edition on your own is possible, but it’s a highly esoteric field and you should approach it expecting a lot of sniffs from textual scholars if you don’t live up to their high standards.



__PS: Harvard, if you’re reading this, either take down the paywall or change your `robots.txt` to stop google sending people to texts that they won’t be able to read__
