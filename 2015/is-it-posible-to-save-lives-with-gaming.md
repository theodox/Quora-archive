Besides the teaching skills and connecting people, don't forget that lots of people who have physical (or sometimes emotional) disabilities find an outlet in games for the kind of agency which is denied to them in real life. MMOs have been a vital social medium for who can't easily travel or communicate verbally. People who are socially disconnected often find connections in online communities, interacting through avatars in ways the don't feel they can in person. For others, the feats they can achieve in the virtual world are a way of transcending the limitations of the physical world.
