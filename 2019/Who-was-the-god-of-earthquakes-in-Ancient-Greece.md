Generally [Poseidon](https://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Poseidon.html) — better known as the god of the sea — was regarded as the most important earthquake-related deity. One of his common epithets or nicknames was Ἐνοσίχθων, _Enosichthon_  _,_ “earth shaker”.

it’s not completely clear where that association originated, but it is very old — it probably goes back to Mycenaean times when Poseidon has the title _E-ne-si-da-o-ne_  which is believed to be an early version of “earth shaker”. The earthquake/ocean association _might_  reflect the role of tsunamis in the Aegean, particularly the ones which accompanied the [destruction of Thera ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption)and the disasters which accompanied it in all the surrounding waters in the 17th century BC.
