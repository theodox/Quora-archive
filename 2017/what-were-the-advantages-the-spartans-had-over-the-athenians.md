There were a few. They weren’t overwhelming, which is why the Peloponnesian war dragged on for an entire generation (431 - 404 BC) but they were part of the interesting asymmetry of the conflict.

Starting with the obvious, __the “invincible” Spartan army.__ The war proved, in fact, that the Spartans could be beaten on the field — however the mystique of Spartan military power was a key part of the way the war played out in the imagination of the Greek world. Athens — with at least 4 times the population and far more resources — submitted more or less passively to annual Spartan invasions of its territory, relying on its walls for protection and repaying the Spartans with hit-and-run seaborne raids. In a whole generation of war the Athenians sought only _one_ open field battle with the Spartans: at [Mantinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mantinea_(418_BC)) in 418 — which ended in a Spartan victory. And that was the after they’d humiliated the Spartans at [Sphacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sphacteria) (424) and [forced a](http://www.ancient.eu/article/952/) [victor’s peace ](http://www.ancient.eu/article/952/)on Sparta. Mantinea restored the Spartan’s reputation, and for the rest of the war the Athenians avoided tackling the Spartans head-on.

That reputation for invincibility, in the end, mattered more than actual battlefield prowess. The mere arrival of a Spartan commander (even without any troops at all) put heart into Athens’s enemies and made the Athenians overcautious: for example, the arrival of [Gylippus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DG%3Aentry+group%3D12%3Aentry%3Dgylippus-bio-1) in his red cloak meant at least as much to the defense of Syracuse as the measly 4 triremes which he brought with him.

The second big advantage which the Spartans possessed was equally psychological. As the long-time guardians of traditional Greek mores, __the Spartans were the social ideal of conservative aristocrats__  everywhere in the Greek world — even in Athens where they found plenty of admirers like [Cimon](http://www.ancient.eu/cimon/), [Xenophon](http://www.ancient.eu/xenophon/), and [Critias](http://www.ancient.eu/Critias/). Their reputation (not always deserved) for honesty and straightforwardness was a key asset in the struggle because it enabled them to mobilise support among the conservative strata of almost every city.

On the flip side, the almost revolutionary ardor of the Athenian democrats appealed to the lower classes in much of the Greek world — one of the reasons the war was so long and so vicious was that it took on many of the characteristics of a civil war, breaking the traditional pattern of shifting city-state alliances which usually tended to minimise large-scale violence between Greek states.

Since more of the Greek world was like Sparta (rural, conservative, and led by aristocrats) than like Athens (commercial, democratic, and open to social change) the Spartan image was a valuable asset in making allies. Towards the end of the war and in the immediate aftermath the Spartans squandered this advantage with high-handed, imperialistic policies not much more ‘traditional’ than those of Athens — but for much of the conflict they had an easier time finding friends than the Athenians did.

The last big advantage the Spartans had — and in the end, it’s the only one that really counted — was very much out of line with their image as stalwart warriors and defenders of Greek liberty. It was, however, far more concrete: it was __Persian gold.__ 

Starting 421, the Spartans came to an [agreement ](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/thucydides/the-treaties-between-persia-and-sparta/?)with the Persians: in return for Persian support the Spartans agreed to return all of Ionian Greece to Persian control. They also agreed not to collect monetary tribute like the Athenians had done: effectively, they renounced any chance of taking up Athens’ mantle as the protector of Greece against Persia. Many Greeks — including Spartan allies — regarded this as a base betrayal of the Greek people and of Sparta’s professed values. However it was Persian money which paid for the fleets that eventually beat the Athenians at [Notium ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Notium)and [Aegospotami.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aegospotami) Honor and bravery are great — but Persian gold was the real sinew of the Spartan victory.

Without Persian money it’s unlikely that the Spartans could have managed more than another stalemated conflict. The Spartans would go on to act as Persian proxies again a generation later when they signed [Peace of Antalcidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Antalcidas), which effectively made Persia the arbiter of Greek city-state politics with Sparta acting as Persia’s Greek proxy.
