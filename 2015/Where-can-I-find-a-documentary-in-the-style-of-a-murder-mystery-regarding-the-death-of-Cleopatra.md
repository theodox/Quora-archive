The facts of Cleopatra's death are widely publicised (though the sources are actually not very contemporary: more in [Steve Theodore's answer to What is the true story behind Cleopatra and Marc Anthony's suicide?](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-true-story-behind-Cleopatra-and-Marc-Anthonys-suicide/answer/Steve-Theodore?srid=zLvM&share=1)) . She killed herself after losing a war against [Octavian (aka Augustus](http://www.roman-empire.net/emperors/augustus.html)), the heir of Julius Caesar and the first Roman emperor.

If you want an ancient egyptian murder mystery, you could try [The murder of King Tut](http://amzn.to/1GlCTES) for non-fiction (although it's not presented mystery-style) or one [Lynda S. Robinson's](http://amzn.to/1Qwm55S) _Lord Meren Mysteries_  series.
