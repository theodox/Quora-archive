Here’s a really graphic example of the complexities of Ptolemaic Egypt. This lady here…

These are both [Cleopatra VII](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-cleopatra-151356013/), the last queen of Ptolemaic Egypt. (You can actually read the hierogplyhs, if you check out [this answer](https://www.quora.com/How-were-the-Hieroglyphics-deciphered/answer/Steve-Theodore)) .

The Ptolemies were definitely foreigners . Alexander the Great drove the Persians out of Egypt in 332 BC. The Ptolemaic dynasty was founded by Alexander’s general [Ptolemy Soter](http://www.ancient.eu/Ptolemy_I/) after Alexander’s death fragmented his empire. The family was _very_  Macedonian, because they borrowed the Egyptian habit of brother-sister marriages to keep the crown in the royal family (Cleopatra's [family tree is very knotty](http://the-girls361.weebly.com/cleopatras-family-tree.html)).

On the other hand, Ptolemaic Egypt was always majority Egyptian. The non-native population of Egypt can’t be known with certainty, but the high estimates suggest that Greeks made up, at most, about 30% of the population. There had been permanent Greek settlements in Egypt since the Pharaohs allowed Greek traders and mercenaries to settle in the 7th century BC, but the large majority of the population — especially outside the cities — were of native Egyptian background.*

At the high end of the social scale, though, Greeks monopolized positions of power in the government, military, and commerce: you don’t see a lot of native Egyptians acting as generals, as royal ministers, or aristocrats. Alexandria was a Greek city, essentially a segregated one with distinct quarters for Greeks, Egyptians and Jews. It was organized like a traditional Greek city — which meant restrictive citizenship, so that the Egyptian and Jewish segments of the population were largely excluded from city government and high social status. Important cities tended to follow Alexandria’s example in miniature.

Despite that exclusionary policy in the cities, the Ptolemies did make a big point of patronizing Egyptian temples and the priestly hierarchy — there’s some reason to see the Ptolemaic Egyptian priesthood as the continuation of what was left of the native aristocracy. The temples were big and powerful and arguable had more impact on the average Egyptian than the goings-on inside the Greek cities.

In less exalted stations, intermarriage was common: it’s quite common to find records of families where one brother has an Egyptian name and another brother a Greek name. Mid-level bureaucrats and small time officials, and after the first few generations soldiers, show a mix of Greek and Egyptian names.

At the very bottom of the social… er… pyramid were the peasantry, who were pretty much all native Egyptians. Ptolemaic Egypt was a highly regulated plantation state: personal and social mobility were strictly limited. You needed official permission to leave your home district and a good deal of effort was expended on keeping people where the government thought they belonged. The combination of an agricultural, pre-modern society and an ancient version of the [Chinese Hukou system](https://www.thoughtco.com/chinas-hukou-system-1434424) kept the countryside very homogeneous.

On a cultural level, Egypt was equally complicated. The Ptolemies supported the native religion — they were particularly fond of the Egyptian tradition of theocratic king-worship, which they adopted (following [Alexander’s example](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised)). Since the Persians had been very unfriendly towards the native tradition, this stance earned the Ptolemies a lot of good will. The Ptolemies also encouraged syncretism — the cross-pollination of Egyptian and Greek religious ideas; new cults like that of [Serapis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapis) seemed like a good way to bring Greek and Egyptian subjects together.

_Mummy portraits from Faiyum: in style, purpose and content, a complex mix of Egyptian and Greek_ 

The influence did not flow only one way, however: many Greeks adopted Egyptian beliefs and practices, for example [mumification](https://mikedashhistory.com/2014/12/16/the-fayum-mummy-portraits/). Or it might be more correct to say the adopted Graecified versions of Egyptian beliefs. The cult of Isis and Osiris, in particular, struck an emotional chord which was rare in conventional Olympian worship and found wide popularity outside of Egypt as well; you can see that Greco-Egyptian synthesis in Plutarch’s [De Iside et Osiride](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0239) and Apuleius’ [The Golden Ass](http://www.unrv.com/book-review/the-golden-ass.php), and the [Temple of Isis in Pompeii.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Isis_(Pompeii))

__TLDR?__  It’s complicated.



*Less well known is the fact that there was a large Jewish minority, in Alexandria several military cities: the Ptolemies encouraged Jews and occasionally other foreigners to settle in Egypt as a hedge against native uprisings.
