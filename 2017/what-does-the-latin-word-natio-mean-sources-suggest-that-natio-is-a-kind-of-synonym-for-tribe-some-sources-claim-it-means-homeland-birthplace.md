A good roundup [here](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=natio), but you can get the gist of it from the words in English that share the same root — _natal, nativity,_ and _nascent._ The actual root is the verb _nascor_ , which is “to be born” and the noun ultimately means ‘a birth’. By extension it means “things born together”, which could be a species of animal or a group of people.

In older translations you’ll often see it translated as ‘race’ — but that’s before the 19th century redefined ‘race’ from ‘a related set of people’ to a pseudo-biological classification.

The Romans usually viewed a ‘nation’ as a less developed form of community (not an inferior set of _people)._ So, a distant tribe might be a _natio_  — they were all ‘born together’, almost an extended family — but the Romans would not have spoken of a ‘Roman nation’. If you were talking about citizens of a civilized state you’d usually say _populus_ , the citizen body, or the _civitas_ , the city.
