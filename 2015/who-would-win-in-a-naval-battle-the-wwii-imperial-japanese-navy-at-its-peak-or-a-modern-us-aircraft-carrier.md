It would be a draw: despite overwhelming advantages the US carrier would wink out of existence and return to its own time to avoid creating an impossible paradox, as I learned from [this documentary:](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080736/)

On the other hand it should be recalled that before History intervened the US aircraft don't need to waste ammo on the Japanese aircraft: they can destroy them by simply buzzing them at supersonic speeds (at least, that's in the novelization of the movie as I recall it , 35 years on...). This might come in handy if for some reason the IJN is time-tunneled forward to today rather than reverse.

History always repeats itself: the first time as tragedy, the second as farce, the third time as _merch_ :
