Janus is an old Italian god with no clear analogy in the Greek pantheon — when the Greeks showed up and started convincing the Romans (on somewhat flimsy evidence !) that they Italian pantheon was really just the Greek version under other names, they never found a good matchup for Janus. He’s a very old part of the Roman pantheon with links to lots of different social and natural functions; he probably represents a very old stratum of Italian religion which predates the absorption of Greek ideas into Italy.

Being so old he’s got lots of very different jobs, but his primary specialty is ‘lines of division’ — he was probably originally the tutelary spirit of field boundaries, marking the beginning of one field and the end of the next. From there he generalized into boundary conditions of all sorts; hence his association with the transition from peace to war and vice versa — the Romans formally marked peace (rare, for them) by closing doors of the temple of Janus. Janus presided over all sorts of beginnings and ends and was frequently invoked at the beginning of festivals and prayers to other gods.

By historic times at least he became almost the personification of transition as a concept. Here’s a really good original roundup of Janus, as presented in Ovid’ _Metaphorphoses,_ where Ovid treats him as not just the god of doors or boundaries but of change as a principle:

> But what god am I to say thou art, Janus of double-shape? for Greece hath no divinity like thee. The reason, too, unfold why alone of all the heavenly one thou doest see both back and front. While thus I mused, the tablets in my hand, methought the house grew brighter than it was before. Then of a sudden sacred Janus, in his two-headed shape, offered his double visage to my wondering eyes. A terror seized me, I felt my hair stiffen with fear, and with a sudden chill my bosom froze. He, holding in his right hand his staff and in his left the key, to me these accents uttered from his front mouth: “Dismiss thy fear, thy answer take, laborious singer of the days, and mark my words. The ancients called me Chaos, for a being from of old am I; observe the long, long ages of which my song shall tell … ‘Twas then that I, till that time a mere ball, a shapeless lump, assumed the face and members of a god. And even now, small index of my erst chaotic state, my front and back look just the same.

> Now hear the other reason for the shape you ask about, that you may know it and my office too. Whatever you see anywhere – sky, sea, clouds, earth – all things are closed and opened by my hand. The guardianship of this vast universe is in my hands alone, and none but me may rule the wheeling pole. When I choose to send forth peace from tranquil halls, she freely walks the ways unhindered. But with blood and slaughter the whole world would welter, did not the bars unbending hold the barricaded wars. I sit at heaven’s gate with the gentle Hours; my office regulates the goings and the comings of Jupiter himself. Hence Janus is my name…

> My business I have told. Now learn the reason for my shape, though already you perceive it in part. Every door has two fronts, this way and that, whereof one faces the people and the other the house-god; and just as your human porter, seated at the threshold of the house-door, sees who goes out and in, so I, the porter of the heavenly court, behold at once both East and West. Thou seest Hecate’s faces turned in three directions that she may guard the crossroads where they branch three several ways; and lest I should lose time by twisting my neck, I am free to look both ways without budging.”



Mercury, by contrast, is pretty much a clone of Hermes — in fact there’s no clear evidence for an independent Mercury in Italy before the 5th century BC. From the moment he does show up (in Etruscan sources, as [Turms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turms)) he’s already kitted out with the Greek rig of winged hat and shoes.

We don’t know much more than that but it suggests that the Greeks and Etruscans agreed on the identification of an Etruscan deity of commerce with Hermes and the Greek representation edged out the older one. Etruscan art was already very heavy with Greek themes around the time when Rome gained its independence, so there may not really be a separate Mercury at all (his name, in Latin, is probably derived from the same root as _merchandise_ ) .

Italian Mercury doesn’t have as much of the sexual aspect in Italy that he has in Greece. In Greek cities it was common to find stone pillars sporting male genitalia, known as [Herms.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herma) These were often use as signposts or boundary markers, which might be the aspect of Hermes that reminds one of Janus; but mythologically at least they are quite different.
