Strictly speaking Caesar was never said (in Latin, anyway) to be a “god” — he was a _[divus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Ddivus)_ __ rather than a _[deus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=deus&la=la#lexicon)_ _._ 

We don’t really have a good vocabulary in English for the difference, but a _divus_  is similar to what Greeks would call a [ἥρως, a “hero”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_hero_cult) — a mortal who did some deed that was so extraordinary that he would receive sacrifices and honors long after his death: what one Greek writer ([Dionysius Halicarnassus, 7.72](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/7C*.html)) described as

> the demigods whose souls after they had left their mortal bodies are said to have ascended to Heaven and to have obtained the same honors as the gods.

In Greek tradition this was very common — for example the founder of your city or a great war hero might receive these kinds of honors as a regular part of the civic religion. The career of Caesar — the great conqueror, beloved by a lot of the people, directly responsible for the welfare of his tens of thousands of soldiers and their families — was a perfect example of the sort of superhuman achievement that would get someone recognized as a “hero”

…. at least among his political supporters.

So, Caesar’s ascension falls into a very different quadrant of Greco-Roman religion than the more familiar Olympians. A deified mortal was a _coelicola,_ an “inhabitant of heaven” — someone who had achieved a special state that granted them a more prosperous immortality than the afterlife of ordinary folks. But they were not a key part of the order of the universe: Caesar was important, but Jupiter didn’t return his calls right away.

It’s true that line between god and hero was somewhat negotiable. After the career of Alexander the Great — whose pretensions to being an full-fledged god were quite controversial during his lifetime, but who fit the traditional idea of a ἥρως to a T — Greek monarchs began to expect “heroic” honors and sacrifices as a regular part of the dignity of their rule. Over time, though, they tended to promote themselves from heroes to fully-fledged gods: a process which the Romans viewed with amusement until the end of the Republic.

Caesar was the first Roman to be recognized as a divus at Rome since the days of the kings, and many Romans were uncomfortable with the idea, so the distinction was relatively well maintained during living memory of his death. Eventually the _divus/deus_  distinction was eroded: some of the crazier emperors (Caligula, Nero) flirted with being _dei_ while alive and Domitian (81–96) openly ruled as _dominus et deus_ , “master and god” — for which he’s received bad press ever since. But even Domitian never claimed he could fry people with lighting bolts.

There’s a whole separate dimension outside of Italy, where people (both in the Greek east and the barbarian west) tended to be less disturbed by the idea of living divinities: Caesar was a _divus_ at Rome but there were several places in the Greek world where he received honors as a “god” in the same (somewhat ambiguous, but less coy) sense that Alexander’s successors were gods.
