It’s not completely random. Out of the three big pieces — subjects, verbs and objects — Latin _almost_ always runs with either Subject-Object-Verb (about 45% of the time) or Subject-Verb-Object (about 42% of the time). All other options occupy the remaining 13%, and a lot of those are in poems where the poets are stretching ordinary usage to hit their metres.
