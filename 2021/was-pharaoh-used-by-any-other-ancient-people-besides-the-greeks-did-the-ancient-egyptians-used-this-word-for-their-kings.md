The hieroglyph for “Pharaoh” has an interesting history; it’s actually a kind of [metonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy), a part-for-whole turn of speech rather than (at least at first) a formal title.

The upper glyph is a house, the lower one depicts a wooden column but it means “great” . So “pharaoh”* is literally “the Great House,” that is, the royal palace. Egyptian scribes used it to refer to the king indirectly in much the same way we’d say “the White House” when we really mean “the president” or “Number 10 Downing St.” when we mean the prime minister.

In long-lived Egypt the term gradually lost its original meaning; in round numbers you could say the “place” meaning was in use by around 2000 BC and by around 1000 BC the “royal” meaning had pretty much taken over. However it’s important to remember that Egyptians _loved_  to talk about their kings in detail: why just say “pharaoh” when you can say

> The strong bull, beloved of Ra, whom the latter caused to appear as king in order to unite the Two Lands

or

> He who has appeared in the Double Crown like Horus, the son of Isis, and pacified the gods with Maat

(Royal titles galore at [pharaoh.se](https://pharaoh.se/pharaoh/Shoshenq-I))

As a very Egyptian metonym, “pharaoh” didn’t have any real relevance to other countries. It was specific to an Egyptian monarch in the same way “Sublime Porte” is specific to Ottoman Turkey. There are titles which did make that jump to trans-national appeal: _Caesar_  became a word for emperor in many languages (_Czar, Tsar, Kaiser_ ) and the ancient Mesopotamian title “King of Kings” became a cliche in languages everywhere from Ethiopia to India.** Pharaoh, however remained resolutely Egyptian. The Ptolemies didn’t bother to translate it when recording things in Greek, even when they preserved other titles — for instance on the [Rosetta stone](http://rosettastone.hieroglyphic-texts.net/sections/sections-1-2/) you find “Pharoah” repeated many times in the Egyptian portions but never transliterated into the corresponding Greek.

There is however one possible exception.

The Nubian kingdom of [Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monarchs_of_Kush), Egypt’s southern neighbor, had a long a complex (though not always peaceful) relationship with Egypt. Their kings used the title __Qore__ (we’ve found it written in the Kushite [Meroitic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meroitic_script) and the Egyptians wrote it phonetically as _kwr_ in Demotic). P-Q swaps are not uncommon sound variants; for example Greek _pente_  becomes Latin _quinque,_ and Latin _aqua is_ Romanian _apa._ So, it’s conceivable that the Kushite kings adopted the title “pharaoh” from their Egyptian neighbors but their pronunciation was sufficiently different that when the Egyptians heard it (during the campaigns of [Psamtik II,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psamtik_II) just after 600 BC) the didn’t realize its origin. [Several Kushite kings were also Egyptian pharoahs in the most literal sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt) so it’s an appealing hypothesis. Nonetheless this is just a guess — we don’t really know much about the Meroitic language so the resemblance could be entirely coincidental.



* The [actual Egyptian pronunciation is hard to reconstruct](https://christhum.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/an-etymological-history-of-pharaoh/) and must certainly have changed over the millennia. “house” is ___pr___ ____ but we don’t know what its thematic vowel was; “great” is ___ꜥꜣ___  where the first sound is probably similar to an Arabic [ayin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin) and the second is similar to an [aleph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph#Ancient_Egyptian) — again without the intervening vowel. In the Hebrew Bible its פַּרְעֹה something like “par-oh” — but the vowels there were added only about 1500 years ago. So we’re mostly dependent on Herodotus, who transliterated the word as φερων. It entered Latin as _farao_ via the Vetus Latina Bible, and _pharao_ in the Vulgate. It’s also ⲫⲁⲣⲁⲱ in the Coptic Bible, so it’s either (a) pretty close or (b) Egyptians had abandoned the word and then re-introduced it from Greek while translating their Bible.
