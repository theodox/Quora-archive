# Is there any specific date or event in which we can ensure that democracy was created by the Greeks in Athens? Is 508 BC the right date?

All dates in this period are a little squirrelly due to the imprecision of the Greek calendar and and the fact that our sources didn't usually try to record events on the kind of linear time scale we expect today. That said, it's very well documented that [Cleisthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleisthenes) organized the government of Athens to give sovereign power to the citizen assembly after chasing out [Hippias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippias_%28tyrant%29), the the reigning _tyrannos_ (which is usually translated 'tyrant', but really means something more like 'supreme leader' -- the modern version is more negative than the Greek).

This is recorded both in literary sources ( Plutarch, Herodotus, Aristotle) and some surviving epigraphy. The conversion to our calendar might be off by a year +/- but there's no question about the events.
