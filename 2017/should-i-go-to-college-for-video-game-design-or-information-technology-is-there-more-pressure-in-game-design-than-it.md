Generally, games is pretty stressful compared to IT. Any product oriented business — games, movie production, a tech startup — is more stressful than a mature, service oriented job.

In games you have to race the clock: missing deadline will impact the profitability of the project and maybe even its commercial viability (for example, __[Battleborn](https://battleborn.com/)__ ____ would probably have sold a lot more copies if it has released on schedule in February of 2016… slipping to May landed is squarely in the shadow of __Overwatch__ , which can’t have helped sales).

Moreover, in games you are usually not working with a well defined problem set. Even if you’re working on a well known franchise, the underlying tech evolves very fast; the last version’s tech may not be adequate in the current market. If you’re working on a new IP you won’t really know where the interesting fun bits of the concept are until you’ve got a working title, which may take a couple of years… and you may find out your cherished plans just aren’t going to work.

This isn’t to say that there are no emotional (or, if you’re lucky, financial) upsides to games. However it’s definitely pretty far on the high-stress, high-risk end of tech careers. It’s not going to be a happy choice for people who value stability and predictability in their work lives. It does not help that games is a tiny business compared to the computer business as a whole: a career in games will most likely land you in about a dozen cities worldwide whereas good IT skills are in need everywhere.

Full disclosure: I pretty much never recommend anyone go to a dedicated games program. Not many of them are well enough connected to repay the up-front costs with a better shot at a job. And, since about half of new games people don’t stay in the industry beyond 5 years, it’s not a wise investment. Games is like what my creative writing teacher used to say about a career in writing: “if you don’t _have_  to do it — you shouldn’t”
