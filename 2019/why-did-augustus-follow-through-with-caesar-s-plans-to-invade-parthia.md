We don’t really know what Caesar intended — in fact, there’s a school of thought envisions Caesar’s Parthian campaign as a desperation move, basically a frustrated general going back to something he was really good at (killing people and taking their stuff) after trying and failing to settle in as a quasi-monarch at home. But, in any case, Augustus didn’t need Caesar’s plan of campaign: he had an ace in the hole. The key to Augustus’ success is the fact that the Romans had finished their own civil wars but the Parthians had not.

In the 40’s, when the the Romans were at each other’s throats, the Parthians had taken full advantage. They backed Brutus and Cassius against the Caesarians — in fact, a Parthian contingent fought at Phillipi for the Republic against Caesar. As the Republican faltered Antony’s general [Ventidius Bassus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Ventidius_Bassus) won a major victory against the Parthians in 40 — but the one of the enemy commanders was [Quintus Labienus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Labienus) — the son of one of Caesar’s key aides in Gaul.

By the time Augustus went east, however, the tables had turned: Rome was once more politically united and now the Parthians were at each other’s throats. From 32 to 26, the pretender [Tiridates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiridates_II_of_Parthia) and the legitimate but unpopular Parthian emperor [Phraates IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phraates_IV) waged a seesaw battle for the throne. Besides the normal wastage of a civil war, however, this conflict also offered Augustus a critical hostage: Tiridates captured Phraates’ infant son in 30 BC, and the boy ended up in Roman hands as a diplomatic hostage.

Tiridates disappeared from the scene in 25 or thereabouts, but by that point Augustus had a free hand. Egypt, the only remaining great power in the west, was now under his personal control and he was flush with the spoils of conquest. His armies were large and still fresh from victories all over the Roman world.

And, he had the Parthian emperor’s son.

We think that Augustus started negotiating with the Parthians in 23, when his right-hand man Agrippa was reorganizing the east and its defenses. The negotiations proceed slowly, but eventually an agreement was reached: the prince would be swapped for the lost eagles of Carrhae and Antony’s failed campaign, and a Roman client would be enthroned in Armenia — but the Parthians would be left in undisputed control of their side of the Euphrates and the two empires would coexist.

The deal was backed by a thinly veiled threat: Tiberius was dispatched with an army to the Armenian border while Augustus himself went to Syria. But the swords remained sheathed: in the end Augustus’s campaign in the east was a diplomatic, rather than a military success.

_A coin of Augustus, celebrating the return of Crassus’ eagles. The Parthian (at right) is shown returning the standards, the legend should read SIGN[IS] RECE[PTIS] CAESARE “the standards received [by] Caesar”._ 

The return of the standards was a highlight of Augustus’ career. In his autobiography he included the fact that he had “compelled” the Parthians to return the lost Roman standards, though without describing _how._ He did however have the decency not to actually invent any phony battles to justify his achievement: the celebrations and propaganda are reasonably coy about the actual circumstances of the return. He did get a victory arch and a big celebration, but did not celebrate a triumph proper.
