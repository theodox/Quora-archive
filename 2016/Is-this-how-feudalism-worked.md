The ‘feudal system’ is something of a misnomer - it was not a ‘system’ and there was a huge amount of variety from place to place. So any summary is a bit misleading. That said:

Basically the system was one in which the higher authorities gave rights over land in return for service — usually but not exclusively military service (you might also be given a fief for service as, say, a royal bureaucrat or even as a clergyman). The system was mostly a reflection of life in a cash-poor economy: it was easier to assign the rents for an area to your retainer as his income than to collect the income yourself as money and then to pay it out in cash.

Most often the [fief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fief) was agricultural land and the value of the grant was the rents (either in cash or in kind) of the tenant farmers who actually worked the fields. However other kinds of income source could also be given as fiefs: for example you might instead grant somebody the tolls on a bridge, or the import duties on a port, or the fees from a market fair.

Originally this was literally just a substitution for other forms of pay. The king or duke or other feudal magnate still retained the _ownership_  of the property they gave out as fiefs, they merely assigned its revenues to one of their henchmen as a cheaper method of paying them. When the vassal died, the grant reverted to the authority which had granted it. Over time, however, more and more of the vassals tried to make the temporary, conditional grant of rights into permanent ownership —and, since there was relatively little social mobility the heir of the previous vassal was often the best or at least the easiest choice in any case. Fiefs pretty quickly became hereditary in practice if not in law, and the ‘fee for service’ aspect faded into the background although powerful lords made periodic attempts to revive it.

Not surprisingly the pattern of rent-grant instead of salary was repeated down the line: cash-poor kings gave land rights to the biggest lords in return for service and support; these lords gave some of their rights to their own retainers. This creates the misleading impression of a tidy pyramid based on rank — but really it is more akin to the payroll of any big organization flowing out through different departments. And, like lots of big organizations, it was constantly being re-negotiated as people on both ends of the deal tried to improve their positions.

_Conceptually kind of correct - but it’s way, way more tidy than the reality, which was no more neat and modular than any other economy or society._ 

Other rights - especially judicial powers (especially the so-called [high justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High,_middle_and_low_justice), or power to inflict capital punishment) were supposed to derive from public office, not from the simple fact of having a feof. Since the tenants attached to a particular piece of land were sometimes serfs or slaves, some kinds of legal powers did attach to the fief, mostly related to property disputes and misdemeanors. But serious criminal charges (especially those connected with the death penalty) were supposed to be tried by royal officers — who might or might not be the local feudal powers: the balance of power between central powers (kings and dukes) and local ones swung back and forth a lot depending on local conditions and political ups and downs.

One odd side aspect of the system is that it also put pretty stringent limits on what the king or duke could ask of retainers: in the fine old spirit of ‘I ain’t paid enough for this,’ many forms of vassalage included time limits on the amount of service (at least of _offensive_  military service) that the higher authorities could demand. This made it very difficult for a king without other means of persuasion to raise an army for more than garrison duty.

Not surprisingly, the whole system was far less efficient than a cash-based system of payment. As early as the 13th century many better-off vassals converted their theoretical military service into cash payments, which the kings would use to hire mercenaries — a process which eventually produced the professional armies of the 14th and later centuries.

My favorite book on the subject is Marc Bloch’s_[Feudal Society](https://tenthmedieval.wordpress.com/2014/06/01/in-praise-of-marc-blochs-feudal-society/)_ _,_ which is still great after nearly a century.



> __Original question included this :__ So basically the president of the usa gives donald trump some land in e.g florida to use (along with the citizens) he then has to raise an army especially cavalry(tanks airplanes etc) using his wealth if his overlord asks him to.

Regarding that:

One last note: since the system was primarily about payment, it would be far less likely that the king would grant Sir The Donald a big, compact jurisdiction like Florida. A much more common pattern would be a patchwork of smaller grants spread around. Partly this was the land-for-service equivalent of making change (Florida, in that world, is like a $1,000 bill — I have a hard time rating Sir The Donald at a fraction of that). Partly it reflects a well-founded worry that giving a retainer too much of a neat, defensible territory will result in him ceasing to be a retainer and turning into a rival. Even if Sir The Donald is granted the Duchy of Florida that probably means he has legal, political and administrative responsibilities there but it will probably only involve a small fraction of the territory as an actual personal fief if the King has any brains.
