The first two are just derived from place-names. Achaea is the northern part of the Peloponnesus, and Argives are from Argos. “Danaeans” get their name from the mythological figure [Danaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danaus), who was supposedly a prince of Egypt who fled from his family and took refuge in Argos.
