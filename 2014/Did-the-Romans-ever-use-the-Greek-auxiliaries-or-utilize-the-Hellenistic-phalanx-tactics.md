Cretan archers and rhodian slingers were both in use during the Punic wars and later, but heavy infantry were usually supplied by allies rather than mercenaries. There were plenty of Greek co-belligerents, particularly Syracuse when fighting the Carthaginians, Pergamon and other Greek states when fighting the Macedonians. The Romans hired a lot of mercenary cavalry -- Hannibal showed that they hard a hard time competing on horseback -- but they were less anxious to buy heavy infantry.

Roman tactics diverged from the phalanx pretty early, its thought around the time of the Samnite wars. The manipular system evolved out of fighting conditions in hilly central Italy and optimizes for tactical flexibility instead of straightforward hitting power -- in particular, Romans trained for evolutions in which different lines performed different tasks -- the 3 ranks (hastatii, principes, and triarii) could switch places as needed, a tactic unlike anything I know of in the phalznx, which was designed as a solid mass.
