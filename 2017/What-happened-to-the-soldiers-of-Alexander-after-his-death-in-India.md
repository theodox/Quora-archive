Alexander didn’t die in India.

His soldiers basically mutinied — after 10 years of continuous fighting, 4000 miles from home, and facing increasingly daunting Indian opposition they refused to go any further. So, he marched down the Indus to the sea, sending part of his forces by ship to explore the Indian Ocean and marching the rest westward.

The return march turned into a disaster as the army had to cross [Gedrosian desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedrosia) of modern Baluchistan; some ancient sources claim that 3/4ths of Alexander’s army was lost in the desert crossing. They survivors continued on into Persia, and thence to Babylon.

Alexander [fell ill in Babylon and died there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Alexander_the_Great) . It’s not clear what killed him, theories range from alcohol poisoning to malaria to poisoning.

It didn’t take long after his death for his inner circle to begin fighting over his legacy. There were a complex series of alliances, peace-deals and wars between Alexander’s top commanders and the royal family. The army split along with its leaders, sometimes following clan loyalties, sometimes following their battlefield commanders, and sometimes following the chances of politics in a very dicey era.

In the first decade, 5 major contenders emerged in control of the fragments of Alexander’s empire: [Cassander ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassander)in Macedon, [Lysimachus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysimachus)in Thrace, [Antigonus the One-Eyed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigonus_I_Monophthalmus) in Asia Minor, [Seleucus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_I_Nicator)in Persia and Afghanistan, and [Ptolemy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter)in Egypt.

Within another 50 years these contenders were reduced to three, centered in Macedon, Egypt and Syria — each of which would eventually be conquered by the Romans between about 167 and 27 BC.
