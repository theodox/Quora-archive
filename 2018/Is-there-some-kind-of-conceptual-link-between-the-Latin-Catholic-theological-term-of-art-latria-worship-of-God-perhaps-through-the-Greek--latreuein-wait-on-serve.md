# Is there some kind of conceptual link between the Latin Catholic theological term of art “latria” (worship of God)—perhaps through the Greek λατρευειν (latreuein, “wait on", "serve with prayer”) and the Hebrew עבודה (’avodah, “work”, “worship”)?

I’m not sure you could establish one conclusively. It seems more like exposure to the Hebrew idea amplified a strain that was already present in the Greek.

_Latria_  definitely comes from λατρεία, which occurs in religious contexts as early as Plato. Socrates (in Apology, 23B) says he has suffered πενίᾳ μυρίᾳ εἰμὶ διὰ τὴν τοῦ θεοῦ __λατρείαν__ , “great poverty because of the _latreia_  of the god” who compels him to seek the truth. However in other contexts λατρεία has a straightforward secular meaning, like “duty” or “work” — the same duality we have in the English “service.”

The verb form λατρεύω shows the same duality; it’s usually just the _working-for-someone_  kind of service but sometimes it’s Divine Service, eg in [Euripides](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0110%3Acard%3D128)

> καλόν γε τὸν πόνον, ὦ Φοῖβε, σοὶ πρὸ δόμων __λατρεύω__ τιμῶν μαντεῖον ἕδραν:
κλεινὸς δ᾽ ὁ πόνος μοι θεοῖσιν δούλαν χέρ᾽ ἔχειν οὐ θνατοῖς, ἀλλ᾽ ἀθανάτοις

> Lovely is the labor, Phoebus, I carry out for you before your house, honoring your prophetic shrine; glorious my labor, to be a slave for gods, not mortal but immortal

When the Hebrew Bible was translated, that double meaning was part of the mix. The Septuagint uses λατρεία and the verb λατρεύω for different Hebrew words relating to work and service. Eg in Deuteronomy 10:12

> And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God requ ire of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

> καὶ νῦν Ισραηλ τί κύριος ὁ θεός σου αἰτεῖται παρὰ σοῦ ἀλλ᾽ ἢ φοβεῖσθαι κύριον τὸν θεόν σου πορεύεσθαι ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀγαπᾶν αὐτὸν καὶ λατρεύειν κυρίῳ τῷ θεῷ σου ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ψυχῆς σου

> ועתה ישראל מה יהוה אלהיך שאל מעמך כי אם־ליראה את־יהוה אלהיך ללכת בכל־דרכיו ולאהבה אתו ולעבד את־יהוה אלהיך בכל־לבבך ובכל־נפשך׃

Sometimes the implication in the Hebrew has a religious connotation and sometimes a more mundane one. There’s not a 1:1 translation; [this link seems to cover the variants](https://www.wenstrom.org/downloads/written/word_studies/greek/latrueo.pdf) but the TLDR is that the relationship is not very linear.

In both Greek and Hebrew there was a web of ideas connected with service in the technical sense, submission in the master-servant or lord-vassal sense, and worship which ended up getting lodged in verbal form. λατρεία and it’s variants are all over the New Testament and touch on all those meanings. It might be easiest to think of it as an obvious, natural metaphor in a social landscape that was profoundly unequal — you could look around you in a Judean or Greek street and see the relationship between master and servant sometimes as a purely economic one, sometimes as one of profound distance, and sometimes as one of devotion. Trying to describe the most unequal relationship of all it would be one of the easiest images to grasp at. So, it’s not too surprising if the same figure of speech appealed to both societies independently. For people like the New Testament writers who had a foot in both worlds the language probably came very naturally.
