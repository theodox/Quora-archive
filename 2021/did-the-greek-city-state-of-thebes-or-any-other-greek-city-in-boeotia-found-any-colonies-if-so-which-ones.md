# Did the Greek city state of Thebes, or any other Greek city in Boeotia, found any colonies? If so, which ones?

There’s no surviving record of a Theban foundation. In fact the Thebans seem to have been one of the least mobile of the Greek states — they don’t feature prominently in any of the multi-state settlements (like [Naucratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naucratis) in Egypt) either. This is probably just a matter of geography: Boeotia has no good ports. The Boeotians were famous horsemen, not sailors. Thebes tended to direct its expansionist energy into efforts to unite the whole of Boeotia under its own banner — something it never achieved, but not for lack of trying.

There were some overseas settlements by the [Aeolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolic_Greek)-speaking cousins of the Boeotians. Traditionally the proto-Boeotians were driven out of Thessaly, traditionally said to be a couple of generations after the Trojan War. The historic Boeotians headed south, but other Aeolic speakers migrated east to the island of Lesbos and then to Asia Minor where they founded [Mytilene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mytilene) and the [Aeolic Dodecapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolis#:~:text=They%20formed%20a%20league%20of,part%20of%20an%20Ionian%20confederacy.). However these weren’t Thebans proper, just fellow Aeolians. You’ll note, however, that Hesiod (born in [Cyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyme_(Aeolis)), in Asia Minor) had family property in Boeotia, near mt. Helicon.

The map below treats “Boeotian” as a separate dialect from Aeolic and Thessalian but it was more common in antiquity to lump them together.
