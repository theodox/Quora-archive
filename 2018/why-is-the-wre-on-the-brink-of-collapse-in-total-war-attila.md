It’s built in to the historical setting. The fifth century Western Empire was a basket case.

The western court had become [infamous ](https://www.quora.com/Which-halves-of-the-Roman-Empire-do-you-want-to-live-in-in-the-year-400CE-East-or-West/answer/Steve-Theodore)for its treachery and incompetence. The two greatest Roman commanders of the age, [Stilicho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho) and [Majorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorian) were both laid low by treachery at home. The economic heart of the Western Empire had fallen to the [Vandals ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandal_Kingdom)in 435, but the effort to reclaim it was scotched by traitorous double-dealing.

Despite all of this [Flavius Aetius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavius_Aetius#Assassination) beat Attila fair and square at [the Catalaunian Plains ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Catalaunian_Plains)in 451, but when Attila attacked Italy from the east the next year Aetius didn’t have the troops to stop him. He made heroic efforts to slow him down with the meager resources given to him by the emperor; for his trouble, the emperor had him assassinated.

_Valentinian III, whose incompetence and paranoia undermined the WRE in the days of Attila. He can at least claim to be less feckless than his creepy unclue Honorius, who presided over the sack of Rome and the breaching of the Rhine frontier._
