The Sassanian era of Persian — known as [Middle Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Persian) — comes to large-scale literature pretty late. This is not surprising — Persian culture at the beginning of the Sassanian period was predominantly oral; the Parthian period produced almost no written literature in Persian either, and much Parthian administration was carried on in Greek or Syriac.

The [Academy of Gondishapur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Gondishapur) was founded by Sassanian emperor [Khosrow I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosrow_I) as part of deliberate program of “Iranization,” privileging Iranian culture over the Hellenistic and Roman elements that were so prominent under the Parthians. The Academy encouraged the translation of Greek and Syriac works (particularly medical texts), very much along the lines that would be familiar later under the Abbasid caliphate. Unfortunately very little of this survives.

However royal patronage — and the authoritarian religious policy which the Sassanians generally pursued — did lead to the creation of a large body of religious texts. Most of the written [Zoroastrian religious canon](http://www.avesta.org/) dates from the Sassanian period. Zoroastrian oral tradition reaches much farther back, but, as far as we know nothing was committed to writing until the 5th or 6th century. Much of this written tradition was destroyed after the Islamic conquest, but it survived in the hands of private owners and in the Zoroastrian exile communities of India and central Asia.

Another large body of texts concern the religious teachings of the Manichees — a religion which originated in Persia during the Parthian era but whose followers were persecuted under the Sassanians. There are no Manichaean texts from Persia proper but there are many from Central Asia (and later, China) where the Manichees found refuge. Much of the Manichaean material is in verse, reflecting the continued dominance of oral culture in this period.

There is very little surviving secular literature from Sassanian Persia. Almost all of it comes quite literally from a single book, known as the _[Pahlavi Codex MK](https://www.amazon.com/Pahlavi-Codex-MK-Facsimile-Iranica/dp/3447067020)_ _,_ from the initials of the Parsee scribe in India who collected it in the 14th century. It contains a miscellany of different, unrelated texts; [a biography of Ardashir I](http://www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/Languages/pahlavi/karnamak.htm), the founder of the Sassanid dynasty, an account of the cities of Persia (the only surviving work of Persian geography before Islam); some epic poetry; a description of chess; and a few smaller items.

Outside of that single book, the main other text is _[Book of a Thousand Judgements](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/madayan-i-hazar-dadestan)_ _,_ a collection of Sassanian laws dating probably to the 7th century.

A lot of secular Persian material was translated into Arabic (and sometimes, eventually back into Persian) but it’s not always clear which texts might have Sassanian antecedents, or how accurately they were transmitted.

The [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Persian_literature) has a good overview; the [Encyclopedia Iranica](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/middle-persian-literature-1-pahlavi#article-tags-overlay) has a much more detailed look.
