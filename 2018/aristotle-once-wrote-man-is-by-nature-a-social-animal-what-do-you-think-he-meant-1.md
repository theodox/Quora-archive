It’s a catchy quote, but it’s a lot more than a throwaway line. It’s absolutely central to Aristotle’s view of human nature.

His view of humanity was, depending on how you look at it, either intensely __humanistic__  or incredibly __ethnocentric__ .

Aristotle saw an ordered community life, lived under rationally derived laws, as the proper form of human existence. He envisions a circular relationship in which humans live for their communities, while communities create the conditions necessary for human flourishing. His real attitude is summed up by an even better quote, usually rendered as “_a man outside the city is either a beast or a god_ ”, although the original ([Politics](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0086,035:1:1253a) 1253a.20) is a bit wordier. He argues that people are essentially designed not to be self-sufficient, but rather to depend upon one another. He actually says that humans are even more socially interdependent than bees— the role of language in human society proves, for him, that we are naturally parts of what you might call and information-sharing network.

In 21st century terms you could liken us to iPads, which are basically pointless without internet connections.

So, you can see this as a very humanistic vision of our place in nature. We are built from the ground up* to form communities, to communicate and to cooperate. Because communication and cooperation are the basic facts of our nature the city, the _polis_ , is the proper framework for human life. It’s how we fulfill our destiny by creating a stable medium for discussion and common undertakings. Man is πολιτικὸν ζῷον , a _political_ animal — which is to say an animal that is supposed to live a _polis_ .

There is however a darker version of the same idea scattered throughout Aristotle’ works, most famously in his declaration that “_barbarians are a community of slaves_ .”

That’s sometimes cited as an example of incipient racism, even though Aristotle doesn’t invoke anything like ‘race’ in his discussion. Instead he claims that barbarians live a sub-political life, in families or tribes ruled by arbitrary authority of patriarchs or chieftains — as opposed to an orderly community of laws where it’s possible for human beings to fulfill their proper destinies as political animals.

In once sense this is simply an application of the theory that he sketched out above — the notion that humans are inherently designed for communal living and that the highest form of communal living is the orderly _polis._ In another sense, however, it amounts to little more than “Greeks and their city-states are the highest form of society — all others are inferior”. The tension between the abstract and concrete versions of this theory is evident everywhere in Aristotle — he is capable of praising the [constitution of Carthage, ](https://www.ancient.eu/article/193/aristotle-on-the-constitution-of-carthage-c-340-bc/)for example, and he recognizes the [legal limitations that differentiate the rule of a Persian king from a lawless tyrant](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D3), but in almost at the same time he can come out with something like “barbarians are servile by nature.”

The ambiguity in the word “barbarian” was just becoming a hot topic of discussion in Aristotle’s day — the conflation of “not Greek” and “not civilized” was already being critiqued in the early fourth century. Aristotle was a bit late to that particular discussion. His idealization of the Greek city state as a ‘natural’ form of community, the beehive of the human bee, made it very hard form him to acknowledge the virtues of other ways of life.



* Aristotle is not invested in the idea of a creator god — he believed, basically, that the world was eternal and “just was” rather than being created. However he definitely believes in the idea of a determinate natural order. Humans are supposed to be social the way fish are supposed to swim: it’s just what we do.
