Humans did not generally live in large, permanent settlements before about 10–11,000 years ago. There are uncounted millennia before that in which settlement and literacy were not practiced anywhere; most of our ancestors were nomadic hunter-gatherers, living a life where literacy had no real use and where economic specializations like spending years learning to read and write were not possible.

We can quite clearly see that thousands of years can elapse between the establishment of a civilization and literacy. For example the site of Jericho on the West Bank was inhabited for more than 5,000 years before the first examples of writing show up there. And there are plenty of societies which made it far longer without writing.

In fact most cultures only achieved literacy within the last millennium or so, usually through contact with literate outsiders. The usual guess is that writing has been independently invented only four, or possibly three, times: in Central America (about 1500 years ago) in China (about 3200 years ago) and in Mesopotamia (about 5400 years ago) and in Egypt (also around 5400 years ago). There are some scholars who argue that Egyptian literacy was stimulated by trade with Mesopotamia. All other known writing systems derive indirectly from one of these (our Latin script came to Rome from Greece, to Greece from Phoenicia, and [ultimately to Phoenicia from Egypt](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-the-Phoenician-alphabet-is-the-oldest-known-alphabet-Where-does-it-come-from-Is-it-possible-to-find-earlier-alphabets-elsewhere-in-the-world/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=01ba5b1e&srid=zLvM)).

In short: literacy is not natural or inevitable — large portions of humanity never felt the need for it.
