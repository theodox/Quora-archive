The tyrannicides thought -- probably correctly -- that there was no way to let Caesar live and preserve the republic. As the other answers and the related question in [Assaph Mehr](https://www.quora.com/profile/Assaph-Mehr)'s answer all point out, the Republic was in pretty terrible shape and the political system was completely out of kilter. 

After all when Caesar returned in 45 it was _15 years_  since the formation of the [First Triumvirate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Triumvirate), which proved that between them Caesar, Crassus and Pompey counted more than the rest of the Republic put together. The death of Crassus at Carrhae in 53 destroyed the relative stability of the 3-way setup leaving only Pompey and Caesar: but Caesar's Gallic conquests, by making him as rich a (and more militarily powerful than) Pompey set the stage for a final confrontation. 

The Republican die-hards who engineered Caesar's recall did not expect a war -- at least, not the war they got and lost -- but they definitely wanted to use Pompey against Caesar, hoping that the struggle would both eliminate Caesar and also leave Pompey in a less dominant position. Unfortunately for them they underestimated Caesar's military skills and Pompey's lack of resolve. However it was not a completely insane plan by any means: it was a weak hand, played as skillfully as possible. Had Caesar been less daring -- or had his armies been more loyal to the Republic than to him -- he might have ended up like many another ambitious governor: prosecuted, kicked out of the Senate, and living in comfortable exile in the provinces. But Caesar chose to fight rather than to give up his power and position, and that ultimately sealed the fate of the Republic. 

As for letting Caesar live: Once he had crossed the Rubicon, there was really no way to, say, 'arrest' Caesar and send him to prison or force him into retirement: like Marius and Sulla before him he was the winner of a civil war, a victorious warlord with an army that was loyal to him personally and not to any legal theory, political ideology or the Roman State. 

The armies that defeated and killed Brutus, Cassius and Cato were fundamentally Caesar's armies: while they did pick and choose among different leaders (Antony at first, flirting with Lepidus, and finally declaring for Octavian) the experienced cadres and the tactical leadership, the tribunes and centurions who formed the core of the armies were mostly Caesar's men: they would not have passively stood by if he were peacefully put out of the picture.
