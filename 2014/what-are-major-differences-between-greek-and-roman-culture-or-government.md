This is a very big topic, it's at least as difficult as 'what are some major differences between French and American culture or government'. So, we're talking very big broad generalizations here.

It's also tricky because of the length of time involved. If you want to compare, say, the Roman republic of the 2d Punic war era with Athens at the time of the Peloponessian war, you'd get one set of answers, but comparing the Rome of Augustus with the age of Alexander would give you a very different set of contrasts.

Here are a couple of very broad brush differences which hold up fairly well over time.

__Roman society was more effective over longer periods of time at maintaining political cohesion.__ 

Greece was a _very_ contentious place; during the time of its independence Greece was perpetually wracked by conflict between the different cities and also within them. Most cities experienced multiple violent changes of government from foreign invasion or domestic upheaval - or, most of the time, a combination of both. After Alexander there were a lot of warring successor kingdoms, and when they weren't fighting each other the royal families were much given to fratricide.

Rome, on the other hand, maintained a far more continuous tradition of governance with far fewer interruptions. This doesn't mean that Rome had no social strife or never lost a war; it was a contentious place too. Even so, Rome did a much more effective job of dominating its neighbors and then assimilating them into its institutions than any comparable Greek city ever did. Alexander's empire outlived him by only four years. There were still Caesars in Rome 520 years after Julius Caesar (and in Constantinople for another 1,000 years after that - although at that point it's more of Greek achievement than a Roman one).

In part because of the power and durability of the Roman state, Rome was able to preserve the _appearance_  of continuity more effectively than its Greek counterparts. Rome had its revolutionaries (Marius, Sulla, Caesar, Augusts) and upheavals (The [secession of the Plebs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secessio_plebis), the [Social war,](http://www.unrv.com/empire/social-war.php) [Hannibal](http://www.ancient.eu/hannibal/)) but the Roman state persisted in name and appearance even after various upheavals. Augustus may have been play-acting the part of a Republican magistrate, but at least he tried to maintain the fiction that the Roman tradition was still alive. The closest Greek analog would be Sparta, which was designed from the ground up to be resistant to change and which maintained a high degree of institutional continuity down to the reign of [Nabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabis).

__Practicalities__ 

It's a common stereotype that Romans tended to be better at practical applications, while Greeks were more skilled at abstractions and theoretical pursuits. There are a LOT of exceptions to a generalization this broad, but it's a useful one for comparative purposes. Greek thinkers broke new ground in mathematics, logic, geometry, and philosophy. Romans did brilliant engineering, excelled at sanitation, and were masters of logistics and and organization. The classic confrontation is the siege of Syracuse where the famous scientist ('natural philosopher') Archimedes used mechanical claws and arrays of convex mirrors to attack the besieging Roman fleet, while the Romans used methodical siegecraft (and discipline: they breached the walls while defenders took off for a holiday) to win the day.

Of course, the dichotomy is rather overdrawn: many of those great Roman accomplishments were done by staffs that included a large number of Greeks (slave and free). And Greeks were no slouches at civil engineering either.

__Militarism__ 

The armies of Republican Rome were strongly rooted in the Italian peasantry. Rome's political reach was broader than comparable Greek states and military service obligations extended farther down the social scale. This made for a large army with a lot of rural soldiers: people who were used to the outdoor life, familiar with manual labor, and self sufficient.

Greek city state armies tended to be more upper class affairs: the extreme example being Sparta, where the entire army was drawn from the privileged class of Spartiates; but even at Athens there was a lot of tension between the relatively well off hoplite class of landowners and prosperous city folk and the thetes - the urban working class who could not afford their own armor and were relegated to the rowing benches of the navy. (Note the the Macedonians during their heyday had a much broader base among rural peasants, more on the Roman model).

Over time both Greek and Roman armies professionalized, but in different ways. After the classical period many Greek armies relied heavily on mercenaries, which provided some impressive technical skills and specialties, but also political unreliability. Roman armies became more professional as the Italian peasantry was displaced in the late Republic by huge slave-run plantations: the military revolutions of generals like Caesar and Pompey were made easier as soldiering became a lifelong career instead of a short-service civic duty.

__Women’s Rights__ 

Roman women had it much better than Greek women.

Greek women (with the very glaring exception of Sparta) were generally sequestered in conditions that would make most modern observers think of 1,001 Arabian Nights: veils, limited access to public spaces, and later on even eunuchs guarding the “women’s chambers”. Roman women had strictly delimited roles too, but much more freedom of movement, better property rights, and the option to divorce, and to remarry. There are plenty of famous Roman matrons who were well known public figures; most famous Greek women were queens or courtesans.

__Multiculturalism__ 

While both Greek and Romans were pretty ethnocentric by modern standards, the Romans assimilated far more people into their institutional lives.

Many non-Greeks adopted Gteek lifestyles, language and habits after the age of Alexander, but the cross-pollination was more frequently cultural than political. Cleopatra might have dressed like an Egyptian queen and patronized the Egyptian gods, but she wouldn't have had Egyptian generals or Egyptian judges. The Greeks tended to settle into the cultures they occupied like the British in India: remaining separate from and believing themselves superior to the people around them, even while encouraging the 'natives' to adopt their culture habits.

Romans did a much more thorough job assimilating the peoples they conquered. Non-Romans could and did become citizens, even from very early times. This started with neighboring groups like the Latins, but eventually extend to the rest of Italy and later to the whole empire. Eventually there would be "Roman" emperors of Syrian, British, Spanish, Gallic, Balkan, and North African descent Farther down the social scale the mixing was much more complete (enough to irritate many Roman traditionalists). This wasn’t just a practical accommodation, either — when emperor Claudius allowed Gauls into the Roman Senate he [pointed out that by his time the Romans had been assimilating former enemies since the days of Aeneas](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/tacitus-ann11a.asp).

__Bloodthirstiness__ 

Romans did have a taste for physical cruelty which Greeks didn't share. Besides the well known gladiatorial shows and feeding-of-Christians-to-lions, the Romans were also fond of making statements like crucifying the 6,000 survivors of Spartacus' army along the roads leading out of Rome.

Greeks did plenty of nasty things too - but with nothing like the scale or efficiency of the Roman arena.

__Co-dependence__ 

Maybe the most important difference of all: The Romans had the Greeks.

The Greeks had a vague feeling of cultural debt (to Egypt, in particular) but they were very conscious of -- not to say obsessed with -- their own cultural uniqueness.

The Romans, on the other hand, were very aware of their debt to Greek culture. Early in Roman history the Greeks were wealthier and more sophisticated than the Romans and their tastes in art and literature became important touchstones for Rome's ideas. Later, as Roman came to dominate the Greek world this influence spread much more widely, but it was also contrasted with Roman contempt for Greek governance and the cultural habits which made the Greeks seem 'untrustworthy' and 'unreliable' to Romans who saw themselves as more honest, straightforward and manly.

Greeks, for their part, began by patronizing the unsophisticated Romans. As Roman military power grew and Rome became increasingly drawn into Greek affairs, the Greeks alternated between fearing the Romans and hoping to 'tame' them with respect for Greek culture and institutions (not a completely vain hope: Aemilius Paullus, and Flamininus, who conquered Greece for Rome, were famously mild conquerors who showed deep respect for local traditions and sensibilities). [Greeks came to respect the power and adaptability of the Roman state, even though they resented their political eclipse by Roman power.](https://www.quora.com/When-Romans-conquered-ancient-Greece-was-it-treated-as-barbarian-victory-against-civilized-society-akin-to-Mongol-conquest)
