Neither, really.

English is ultimately a Germanic language, though for historical reasons it has a lot of French components. The French layer contains a lot of Latin influences but only at second hand.

Latin-derived words were imported in large quantities starting in the Renaissance, and in the 18th and 19th century Greek roots were used to create new scientific terms.
