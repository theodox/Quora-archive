Modern Italians are, by and large, the descendants of ancient Romans.

Its believed - though like most things in ancient history, it's debated - that the bulk of the ancient inhabitants of Italy came down from the north in the early Bronze age (like the Greeks, who came down into the Greek peninsula somewhat earlier, they overlaid and mixed with indigenous groups). These new comers spoke Indo-European languages (connected to Greek, Celtic, German, Persian, and Sanskrit language families) and shared some symbols and cultural traits with the other members of that language family (the Nazi's borrowed the swastika as an emblem because it shows up in many of these so-called "Aryan" cultures, although many modern scholars don't believe that the linguistic and cultural groupings correspond to "racial" ones very tightly).

The whole [Indo-Aryan migration hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_migration_hypothesis) is predictably fraught -- especially in India -- but it does appear that the Bronze age populations of Italy, Greece and Central Europe are ancestrally related in some ways : through language, religious tradition, and social structures. How much of that reflects a large scale migration of a mobile ethnic group -- like the later Germanic invasions of Roman Europe, or the Gallic invasion of Italy -- and how much reflects smaller groups of influential newcomers eclipsing native cultures -- like the Norman conquest of Britain -- is debated.

In any event the Indo-European "Italians" are broken up into several groups by the time we see them in the historical record. The three main groupings were the Latins - from whom the Romans emerged - on the west coast of the peninsula, the Oscans in the south, and the Umbrians in central and east central Italy. These cultures were related but not identical and the early history of Rome was a mixture of cooperation and competition between the Latins and the other two groups. The final assimilation of these different groups only came about after long political struggles, ending in the [Social War (90–88 BC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_War_%2890%E2%80%9388_BC%29). The historical "Roman" population is a the fusion of all these groups.

There were also several unrelated groups in the Italian peninsula who were gradually absorbed into the Roman system. The Etruscans in central Italy might be indigenous, or might have come from Asia Minor where they would have been related to [Phrygians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygia) or [Lydians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydians). They dominated Rome early in the city's history, but were defeated and absorbed by around the 3d C BC. Southern Italy and Sicily were extensively colonized by Greeks as early as the 8th century BC (even today there are pockets of Greek speakers -- and you may recall how Michael Corleone in _The Godfather_  falls for Apollonia --_una belleza magari più greca che italiana --_ a Greek girl -- in Sicily). Most of these cities were incorporated into Roman territory after the [Pyrrhic War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_War). The northern quarter of modern Italy was _Gallia Cisalpina:_ "Gaul below the Alps" inhabited by people closely related the Gallic tribes of France. These areas were conquered in the 2d c. BC.

During the long Roman hegemony in the peninsula there was considerable mixing between the Italians and other groups, but of course poorer rural populations were less mobile than people are today.

While post-Roman Italy had many waves of invaders (among others, the Goths, Lombards, Arabs, and Normans, these groups tended to replace only the upper echelons of society rather than the bulk of the population. Northern Italy is somewhat more "Germanic" looking than the south - but that probably reflects the ancient Gallic heritage as much as outside conquest. Southern Italy shows admixtures from around the Mediterranean. However the overall heritage of Italy is a mix of the historic inhabitants of the peninsula in Roman times.
