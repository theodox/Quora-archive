I assume you mean “concrete” as as apart from the literary evidence of [Diodorus](http://www.livius.org/di-dn/diodorus/siculus.html) and [Rufus](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/curtius-rufus/), [Arrian](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/arrian/), and [Plutarch](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/plutarch/)? And all the hundreds of anecdotes and folktales that came later?

OK, then, let’s work from small to big.

The easiest place to start are the countless [Alexander coins.](http://rg.ancients.info/alexander/tets.html) After conquering the Persian empire he netted enough silver to mint about 20 million of these. Although many have disappeared or been melted down and reminted since, there are tens or hundreds of thousands in collections today — you can get a beat-up single drachma for about $30, but the big tetradrachmai run much higher in good quality…

_even at Walmart!_ 

If you think that’s all just a bunch of lying Greeks, there are a couple of clay tablets from Babylon that are also completely contemporary witnesses. This one, for example, is an astrological diary from the year 331 BC; it record’s Alexander’s defeat of Darius III at [Gaugamela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gaugamela) .

There are others as well for the years right after Alexander’s death at Babylon and they line up with the dates in the literary sources.

If these tablets — about 3′ high — seem too paltry you might go big and consider the [the 70 or so cities he founded](http://brewminate.com/the-many-alexandrias-of-alexander-the-great/). We have not uncovered them all, but we’ve got quite a few from [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria), Egypt — the mother of them all — to [Kandahar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar), Afghanistan.*

Speaking of Egypt, there is a lot of in-place inscriptions in Egypt — fewer survived in Greece itself, because much carved marble was reused to make building materials. Alexander liked the Egyptians and they returned his affection. Here he is dressed as a pharoah.

_Alexander, right, addresses the god Min. The likeness isn’t very good but the identity is clear from the hieroglyphic inscriptions (and many others like this one) Here’s his name in the royal cartouche (in the image above it’s just above his head)._

For a more realistic likeness — compare it to the coin above — there are hundreds of different Alexander statues all over the former Greek world, because they were mass-produced copies of officially commissioned portraits.

Another way to think about it is… __Where else did the Persian empire go?__ 



* Originally_Iskandaria_  where _[Iskander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iskandar)_  is Persian for _Alexander._
