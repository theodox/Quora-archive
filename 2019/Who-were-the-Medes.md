Nowadays we usually use _Medes_  to refer to the _Mada_ (or, in Greek, the _Μῆδοι_ ) to avoid confusion with the other uses of “median.”

The Medes were an Iranic-speaking people from the northwestern part of modern Iran; their capital at [Ecbatana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecbatana) was near modern [Hamadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamadan). They were one of the first of the Iranian-language peoples to pick up urban living. For a long time they were under the sway of the Assyrian empire, sometimes as tributaries and sometimes as subjects. However they joined forces with the Babylonians in the great revolt of 616 BC which brought down the Assyrians; it was a Median army under [Cyaxares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyaxares) which sacked Assur and Nineveh, forever humbling the ancient world’s most fearsome empire.

For about three generations (616 - 550 BC) the Medes ruled an empire which stretched from Asia Minor in the west to the Indus Valley in the east. In 550 the last Median king, Astyages, was overthrown by his Persian vassal Cyrus the Great who replaced the short-lived Median empire with a more durable Persian one which included the old Median territories but also absorbed Mesopotamia, the Levant, Egypt and parts of the Balkans.

Medes and Persians were culturally similar, but not identical. The Persian empire inherited many trappings from the Medes, but also tended to be suspicious of the Medes: the Persians never forgot that they had once been subjects of the Median empire.
