# Why was the Bible based on Greek translations of the Hebrew original scripts instead of writing a more correct translation from Hebrew to Latin?

The Greek Orthodox church still follows the Greek translations that were current in the third and fourth centuries, which go back to the Alexandrian Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, known as the [Septuagint.](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Septuagint) For scholars — not ordinary readers — a version known as the [Hexapla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexapla) was used after the third century. It included the Septuagint text, the Hebrew text in both Hebrew and Greek characters, and three other Greek translations side by side in columns, allowing the reader to compare the variants.

The oldest Latin Bible that achieved much currency was the [Vetus Latina](http://www.vetuslatina.org/) or “old Latin,” which was a Latin translation of the Septuagint. Since Christianity spread to the Latin speaking parts of the empire from the Greek speaking parts, this was the most accessible source — particularly after the Roman-Jewish wars of the first and second centuries disrupted Jewish life all over the empire.

However after 405 the Vetus Latina was edged out by the [Vulgate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate) In that version the Pentateuch — Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy — was translated directly from the Hebrew. The later books of the Old Testament were assembled from a mix of sources in Greek and Aramaic, including the Hexapla. The Vulgate and Vetus Latina coexisted for a long time, but the Vulgate became dominant by the middle ages.

The New Testament, of course, was written in Greek.
