Poor, almost amazingly so. The Spartan lifestyle was deliberately minimalist, intended to keep their warrior class used to rough living and hardened for war; there’s a reason we say “spartan” in English to mean bare, unadorned, and uncomfortable.

There’s a great quote from [Thucydides](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0247%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D10):

> If the Spartans’city were to become deserted, and only the temples and foundations of buildings were left, I think that the people of that time far in the future would find it difficult to believe that the Spartans’ power had been as great as their fame implied…. whereas if the same thing were to happen to Athens, from its visible remains one would assume that the city had been twice as powerful as it actually is.
