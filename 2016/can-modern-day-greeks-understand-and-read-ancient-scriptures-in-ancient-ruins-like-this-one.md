There’s a lot of overlap between ancient and modern Greek: the script is the same and a lot of the vocabulary is also the same (the Greek language has seen several revival movements down the centuries which use classical Greek as a model, so it has not strayed as far from its roots as, say, English or Spanish have). There will also be some spellings that puzzle modern readers: Modern Greek draws mostly from the Attic dialect and the Koine or Common dialect of years after Alexander — regionalisms from before that time will look odd to moderns but probably not too strange to puzzle out. In any case monuments tend to be pretty formulaic, so the many subtle differences in usage and connotation which would make it hard to read an ancient literary text are not as bad when reading things like grave markers or dedications.

For most old material the real problem won’t be puzzling out the words, its the meaning of the contents. A lot of inscribed material is very terse, along the lines of ‘So-and-so dedicated” or “From the Boeotians: 2,500” — stuff that’s tough to puzzle out without archaeological background. On the other extreme there’s a lot of bureaucratic blabber in the inscriptions as well: long lists of committee members, dates, and meeting notes that don’t make for good reading. The Greeks didn’t have printing, so a lot of “paperwork” became “stonework” to make sure it was preserved.

An important stumbling block is typography: ancient Greeks didn’t use much punctuation or word spacing so it can be a bit of a slog. Very old inscriptions are sometimes written [Boustrophedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon) style, “as the ox plows”: one line goes left-to-right and the next one goes right to left, which is very irritating to read (particularly if you’re looking at a fragmentary piece and it’s not clear which lines go which way!).

_A section of a_ boustrophedon _inscription: the top and bottom lines are written like modern Greek but the middle line goes from right to left — note the E’s._ 

[Greek numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals) were written with letter codes, somewhat like Latin’s use of I, V, M, L and so on. Lots of modern folks won’t recognize the coding — at least not all of it.

Lastly, some very old content will include letters that don’t exist in modern Greek like ϡ (roughly, “TZ”), Ϙ (between Q and K) and ϝ (like a W) . These don’t exist in modern Greek, or even in the classical texts that lots of Greeks encounter (though the ϝ does show up in Homer).
