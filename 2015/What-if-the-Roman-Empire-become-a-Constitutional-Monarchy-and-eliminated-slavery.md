If Rome had done either of those things it would not be the Rome we know.

Well, actually slavery could have been eliminated, though it might not really have made the difference we'd expect. By the end of the fourth century the empire was sliding more and more into what we would usually call 'feudalism' -- a system in which a lot of the populace were not slaves (they had legal rights and could own property) but were not "free" to move or choose their own professions. Chattel slavery of the brutal kind that we've all seen in _Spartacus_  declined in the late empire as wars of conquest produced fewer new slaves, and the economy became less urbanized and more focused on rural self-sufficiency. Slavery didn't die out, but something more like serfdom was the reality which affected the largest number late Romans. Since Roman slavery even at its worst (in the two centuries leading up to Caesar) always included the possibility of freedom and even citizenship, there was not the stark (or to modern eyes 'black and white' ) distinction between slave and free: it was was always a gradation of status in a thoroughly hierarchical society. It's not impossible that a reformist Roman emperor might have abolished slavery (as other emperors in various times and places did) but while the name changed the economic realities would probably not have changed very much, any more than the legal end of slavery in the American south abolished rural poverty and exploitation.

_As slaves, serfs or peasants their lives are pretty much the same._ 

As for Constitutional monarchy --that would be a very, very different Rome from the one we know.

The dubious role of legality in the empire can be judged by the fact that there are so many would-be emperors that there is [no way to compile a list without a page of footnotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_emperors); the wiki page, for example lists 86 emperors - of whom only 24 died in their beds ( see [Why was the Roman succession so violent?](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-the-Roman-succession-so-violent-Why-werent-they-able-to-establish-a-functional-succession-system-like-other-large-empires) for more background). 

That lack of legitimacy befits the empire's origins. The warlords who turned the Republic into the Empire (Sulla, Marius, Julius Caesar and Augustus) got their positions through the progressive destruction of the Roman constitution. They neutered the Senate, ignored the sacred veto of the tribunes, and alternated between bribing and ignoring the popular assemblies -- when they were not busy proscribing and murdering their rivals or opponents. Augustus --to give him credit -- seems to have wanted something that does look kind of like a constitutional monarchy: he was the engineer of a successful and quite violent military coup, but he outgrew his youthful nickname ("the boy assassin") and made an effort to rule in concert with the Senate. He did, however, retain personal command of the army , personal control over the key strategic provinces, and a personal guard force in the city (which had, until Sulla's time, been a demilitarized zone). 

This was not a great foundation for a constitutional monarchy. 

 Moreover the early emperors saw the traditional aristocracy as their greatest rivals, and they gradually destroyed the old aristocratic families -- directly, through paranoid persecutions of the kind familiar from _I, Claudius_ , and indirectly because each disputed succession and attendant civil war took an outsize toll from the leading families. So the emotional and social linkage which bound the aristocracies of early-modern Europe to their monarchs was not present to give either the aura of sanctity or the deep social roots that made European kings important even after they lost political pre-eminence: only Augustus ever became the kind of beloved national icon that Queen Victoria would be two millennia later, and his heirs squandered that good will in short order.

Without legal legitimacy or popular sentiment, the real prop of every emperor was the army. The armies were (and knew they were) the ultimate arbiters of power: a loyal corp of legions mattered far more than the law, the imprimatur of the Senate, or the will of the people. From Sulla's march on Rome in 88 BC to the fall of the western empire in 476, there was [only one span of a hundred years without a military coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerva%E2%80%93Antonine_dynasty). The third century produced [more than 50 rival would-be emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century) and came within a hair's-breadth of breaking the empire into pieces.

_It's not an accident you find a lot of coins with the inscription fid_ ___es exercitum___ _: "Loyalty of the armies". That might be a speech - or the emperor might by tossing coins._ _[Didius Julianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didius_Julianus)_ _bought the throne for 25,000 sesterces per legionary in 133_ 

So: a constitutional monarchy is a very unlikely outcome. A few emperors -- Augustus, Titus, Trajan -- seemed genuinely to want the Senate to co-operate in their rule. but none was willing to cede real practical power or control over military force. And by the end of the third century the Senate was not even the ghost of a politically representative body: it was basically a club for imperial hangers-on and retired civil servants. Even the figleaf of popular elections went away sometime in the first century, and by the third century emperors like Diocletian openly and pointedly disdained even the theoretical gift of sovereignty from the Senate : Diocletian dated his reign from the day his army proclaimed him emperor, not the (much later date) when the Senate sent its belated blessing to his approaching forces.

_Diocletian's coin celebrates_ ___concordia militum___ _: "the agreement of the soldiers" He generally made a point of ignoring traditional Republican themes._ 

Of course, simply by existing, the Senate did provide some kind of a platform for trying to sway the emperor. Even if Republicanism was a historical curiosity, the distant memory of representative government was never quite lost (one of the saddest literary echoes of the republic is the lament of Vegetius, writing not long before the sack of Rome, lamenting the long vanished citizen legions and their civic spirit). So even this ceremonial talking shop could have been a focus for change -- much like the otherwise toothless French Parliament of 1798 the Senate could be a fulcrum for opposition simply by existing. One could imagine a Senate gaining the nerve to stand up to Justinian during the [Nika riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nika_riots), or in [the aftermath of the disaster at Adrianople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratian) -- or perhaps, more radically, the rump Senate in Rome might have cut a deal with the Goths [during the siege of Rome in 410](http://Gothshttps://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-400-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging) deposing the worthless Honorius and putting Alaric or his puppet [Priscus Attalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priscus_Attalus) on the western throne. It's hard to see how that could not have been an improvement -- although given the dizzying series of shifting alliances, usurpers and rebellions that marked the years after 400 in the west it's not at all clear that a ringing proclamation from a bunch of retired tax officials and wealthy courtiers would really have staved off the end (indeed, this scenario would have looked a lot like what actually did happen after 475 when Roman Senators and Barbarian kings ruled in partnership).
