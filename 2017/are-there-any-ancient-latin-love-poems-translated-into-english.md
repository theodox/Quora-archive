Quite a few. There are many, many translations of the bigger names dating back to the 15th century so you’ll have your choice — I’ve linked easily available ones but I didn’t really try to find the “best” ones since poetry is so hard to translate and tastes vary so much.

One thing you may notice in the translations is a lot of unfamiliar proper names. The style of most Latin poets (borrowed from Alexandrian Greeks, who loved to name drop) involves a lot of allusions to people and places which aren’t obvious to a modern reader. It’s good idea to have a browser handy just to check, usually the references are just place-setting but sometimes they have an important symbolic weight as well.



[Catullus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus) is one of the most vivid poetic personalities. Here’s a good source for his poems[in English and several other languages](http://rudy.negenborn.net/catullus/?l=l). His poems alternate between delicacy and frankness that’s probably too much for our prudish present-day tastes with amazing dexterity. They are some of the most influential (if least conventionally sentimental) love poems in the western canon.

[Ovid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid) is another influential Roman poet who produced a lot of work, almost all of which is available in translation somewhere or other. The most approachable is [The Amores](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/AmoresBkI.htm); the [Ars Amatoria ](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/ArtofLoveBkI.htm)is more of a cynical pickup manual than “love poetry” in the usual sense.

[Sulpicia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulpicia)is the only woman love-poet in classical Latin; her surviving works are [translated here](http://Sulpicia (http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/sulpicia-anth.shtml) ).

[Horace ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace)is a less emotionally candid poet than the others, but his [Odes](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/HoraceOdesBkI.htm) include several love poems along with aesthetic and political commentary.

[Tibullus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albius-Tibullus) is less famous, but in a lot of ways more “romantic” than Catullus, Horace, or Ovid. His [Elegies](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/Tibullus.htm) include a complex history (real or imagined) with his lover Delia.

[Propertius ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propertius)is another poet who chronicled his love affair in version. [This translation](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/PropertiusBkOne.htm#anchor_Toc201112140) includes a lot of helpful links to the proper names.
