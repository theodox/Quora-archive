# Was it common for enemies fighting Roman soldiers to yank the pilum spears out of their shield after being thrown, and could they straighten out the metal tip if it bent?

Historically it’s been said that the pila bent after penetrating an enemy shield, which made them harder to pull out:

A bent pilum had an additional advantage - it could not be thrown back at the Roman line.

However, there’s debate among archaeologists and military historians about whether this was a primary objective of the design or a useful accident, and how often it actually happened.

We definitely find bent pila on Roman battlefields:

But in order to penetrate a shield properly the head has to be fairly tough, and modern reenactors have a hard time getting their weapons to deform the same way:



This may not make a huge difference. Unless you feel like stopping to put your shield aside and remove the pilum — which of course means you have to unship the shield and extract a two foot or more long shank, while leaving yourself unprotected on a battlefield with various missiles flying around — you’re going to be stuck with a six-foot impediment attached to your left arm. Trying to move will trip you or your comrades — and the leverage of that long heavy shaft may be enough to bend the shank even if it did not bend on impact.

At least some variants were deliberately created for the ‘break and drag’ effect:

> Marius introduced an innovation in the structure of the javelin. Up to this time, it seems, that part of the shaft which was let into the iron head was fastened there by two iron nails; but now, leaving one of these as it was, Marius removed the other, and put in its place a wooden pin that could easily be broken. His design was that the javelin, after striking the enemy's shield, should not stand straight out, but that the wooden peg should break, thus allowing the shaft to bend in the iron head and trail along the ground, being held fast by the twist at the point of the weapon.

Other pila hard barbed heads, which also made them hard to retrieve:

However the effect was achieved, the late-Roman military writer Vegetius remembers the pilum — which had fallen out of use in his day — like this:

> As to the missile weapons of the infantry, they were javelins headed with a triangular sharp iron, eleven inches or a foot long, and were called piles. When once fixed in the shield it was impossible to draw them out, and when thrown with force and skill, they penetrated the cuirass without difficulty

Vegetius seems to be describing a late model, since most pila have much longer shaft than the 11″ he describes. However the medieval [Angon ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angon)was a similar weapon that had a similar behavior and seems to have evolved out of the pilum — another overlooked example of continuity between “barbarian” and “Roman” Europe.
