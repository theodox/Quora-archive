The oldest reported example is in Livy, who reports that [Appius Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appius_Claudius_Sabinus_Regillensis_(consul_471_BC)) executed a fraction of his discontented army during a war against the Volscians (471 BC)

> The soldiers who had thrown away their arms, the standard-bearers who had lost their standards, and in addition to these the centurions and duplicarii who had deserted their ranks, he ordered to be scourged and beheaded. Of the rank and file every tenth man was drawn by lot for punishment.

The Claudian gens was notorious for producing unpopular leaders who treated the commons with contempt; it’s possible that Livy’s example (written four centuries after the fact) is a back-projection of that later stereotype. The Greek historian Polybius, writing around 150 BC, describes it as an ‘ancient practice’ and implies that it wasn’t used in his own time; but it seems clear from his and other Greek accounts that by that period the practice was regarded as a genuine, if archaic one.

In better documented times, [Crassus](http://www.roman-empire.net/republic/crassus.html) decimated his troops during the war against Spartacus. Crassus action was a throwback to a disused tradition, according the second century AD writer Plutarch:

> Five hundred [of Crassus’ men] them, moreover, who had shown the greatest cowardice and been first to fly, he divided into fifty decades, and put to death one from each decade, on whom the lot fell, thus reviving, after the lapse of many years, an ancient mode of punishing the soldiers. For disgrace also attaches to this manner of death, and many horrible and repulsive features attend the punishment, which the whole army witnesses.

The practice was at least remembered well enough that the East Roman emperor Maurice explicitly forbade it in his military manual, the [Strategikon](http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/strategikon/strategikon.htm), in the 6th century.
