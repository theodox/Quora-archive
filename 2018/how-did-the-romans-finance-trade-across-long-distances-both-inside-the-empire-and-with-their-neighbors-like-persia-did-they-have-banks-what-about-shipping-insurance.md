# How did the Romans finance trade across long distances, both inside the Empire and with their neighbors like Persia? Did they have banks? What about shipping insurance?

Generally the institutional support was weak by our standards — but it was still fairly sophisticated.

__Corporate structure__ 

The only business vehicle was a partnership or _societas_ , which was a full partnership between individuals. That set a pretty low cap on the size of an enterprise because the death or withdrawal of any of the partners dissolved the partnership in its entirety: there was no independent “corporate” structure to own assets and so on, which discouraged the creation of very large ownership groups.

__Maritime financing & insurance__ 

That said, there were recognized business opportunities in many different aspects of international trade.

The line between what we’d call export-import financing and maritime insurance was blurry. The standard support for a voyage was [bottomry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottomry) — a kind of hybrid form of financing and insurance in which a ship owner would basically take out a high-interest rate loan to finance a journey with the ship (and, optionally, its cargo) as surety for the loan. Usually many different lenders each took a small fraction of the total bond, since this spread the risk out broadly — a system not unlike the one which founded Lloyd’s of London in the 17th century. This could be a custom-made _societas_  to back a particular venture, or the merchant behind the voyage could farm out fractions of the project to unrelated persons.

The high interest rates on marine ventures were designed as form of risk premium — there was no reinsurance, so the loss of a ship or cargo would leave the lenders out of pocket and high interest was the carrot needed to lure investors. Although Rome had strong usury laws, maritime loan rates were exempt until the sixth century or so — and even then, maritime loans were capped at 12% while all other forms of loan were capped at 8.5%.

We’re unusually lucky — given the generally fuzzy state of our knowledge of day-to-day realities in Rome — to have a pretty complete copy of a maritime contract. [The Muziris Papyrus](http://www.literature-ancient-history.com/romempindi/33377-the-muziris-papyrus.html) concerns the voyage of a ship, the _Hermapollon,_ which sailed the spice run between Myos Hormos on the Red Sea and India. It’s the ancient equivalent of a pre-printed legal form, bolierplate phrases, copied sloppily with the details added in. It lays out the bottomry arrangement which the master of the Hermapollon had to repay. It also covers the complex logistics of getting the cargo overland from Myos Hormus to Alexandria (a caravan of nearly 1000 camels would be required), of paying the tariffs (the Roman state took a flat 25% of the value of imports, usually in kind) and of storage of valuable cargos in bonded warehouses. In this case these aspects were all responsibilities of the master of the _Horapollon,_ although the lenders agents were to meet him on landing and help arrange the details. This was a very serious undertaking: the cargo of the _Hermapollon_ was worth about 9 million sesterces, roughly the cost of keeping a Roman legion for one year!

The bottomry system [filled a vital role in keeping the merchant marine afloat](https://priceonomics.com/how-maritime-insurance-built-ancient-rome/). Much earlier, an Athenian speaker had noted

> The resources required for trade are provided by lenders: without lenders, not a ship, not a ship-owner, not a traveler could put to sea.

__Banking__ 

Romans had access to some aspects of modern banking. In many ways the system would have been recognizable to any 16th or 17th century European merchant. Bankers (_argentarii)_ handled currency exchange, deposits, and letters-of-hand or checks (_perscriptiones)_ as well as loans.

Money changing was an important part of the business: bankers were specialists in the relative value of different currencies (tied, primarily, to their precious metal contents). They were also experts at detecting counterfeits, which were fairly common.

Consumer lending was not universal — the Roman prohibition on usury kept official interest rates low, so only reliable customers (or at least, those with valuable collateral) were wanted. However for Romans of the requisite social class money was available and the hassle of carrying lots of precious metal abroad was avoidable. Bridging loans could be gotten if there were sufficient collateral (gold and silver plate was popular, though land of course was the ultimate hard asset).

There was no form of banking insurance, though large bankers were licensed and to some small degree supervised by the government. Bankruptcies were not unheard of — for a Roman banker to “leave to forum” was an admission of insolvency.

__State support__ 

After the second century BC, Rome was extremely dependent on a vibrant merchant fleet. It took about between 2000 and 4000 voyages every year to supply just the subsidized grain market in the city of Rome — not counting all of the other forms of shipping supplying private needs. So the government spent quite lavishly on supporting the infrastructure of maritime trade. The artificial harbor at [Portus](https://www.archaeology.org/issues/168-1503/features/2971-rome-portus-rise-of-empire), government warehouses to facilitate lading and distribution, and tax incentives for shippers were all ways in which the government helped to subsidize the sea lanes.

The most visible investment, however, was the suppression of piracy, which proceeded in fits and starts from about 150 BC on. Anti-piracy campaigns were major operations: [Pompey the Great’s climactic campaign in 67–66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Gabinia_de_piratis_persequendis) involved 125,000 troops, hundreds of vessels, and interdiction campaign everywhere within 50 miles of the sea: it was the largest single military operation in Roman history to date, which gives some idea of how important it was. It rendered the Roman seas extraordinarily safe for the next three hundred years.
