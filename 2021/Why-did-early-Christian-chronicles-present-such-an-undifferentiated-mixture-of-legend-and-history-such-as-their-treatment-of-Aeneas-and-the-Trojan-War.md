You’ll need to be more specific about “early” here to get a solid answer.

For the most part the differences between Late Antique Christian writers of history and their pagan contemporaries centered on values, not on the line between history and myth. Somebody like, say, Eusebius of Caesarea (writing ~ 325) repeats a lot of material that to us clearly mingles mythology and history; but for the most part, he was simply quoting pagan sources who did the same thing. He drew on a mix of conventional Greek historians and the Bible, with a significant sprinkling of Greek-language information from non-Greek writers like [Berossus the Babylonian, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berossus)[Philo of Byblos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byblos) (a Phoenician), [Manetho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho) (an Egyptian) and [Josephus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus)(a Jew).

When he’s not dealing with religious matters his historiography is pretty conventional Roman-era stuff, though much more Greek-inflected that Roman. After all, the fundamental structure of his chronology is the Greek Olympiad dating system — in fact he’s one of our [prime sources for the names of Olympic victors](http://www.attalus.org/armenian/euseb11.htm).

_Historical texts declined but never disappeared completely. Here’s a lovely Latin copy of Eusebius’ Chronicon written in 699, showing the synchronism between the fall of Troy (“Capta Troia” , at the bottom, described as “406 years before the first Olympiad,” our 1182 BC). In the left column this is comes in year 4 of the Israelite Labdon (=_ _[Abdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdon_(Judges))_ _from the Biblical book of Judges). In the right column in year 8 of the reign of_ _[Mopsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mopsus)_ _in Cilicia. Mopsus is “mythological” in Greek sources, but seems to also be a historical_ Mukšuš _from Cilicia in the 13th c. BC — a perfect example of Euhemerism. Also in the right column you can see the death of Hercules followed a few lines later by Alexander (=Paris) abducting Helen and the reign of “Thuoris”, which is how Eusebius rendered the female pharaoh_ _[Twosret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twosret)_ _.

In keeping with the secular historiography of his era (and living a millennium and a half before copyright laws) he tends to repeat almost _en bloc_  large portions of earlier authors; he’s absolutely indispensable for most ancient historians because his extensive quotations are often the only trace of entire schools of writing. His primary interventions are intended to either establish synchronizations between episodes in his Greek sources and those in his Jewish ones, or sometimes to criticize Greek historians who provided hostile alternative readings of Jewish history.

His treatment of the the mythical origins of Greek and Roman history is hardly unusual — most Greek and Roman writers of the Roman era were aware of the steep dropoff in the reliability of their own traditions before what we’d call the sixth century BC. Writers of a more antiquarian bent tended to record (or embellish) those stories without worrying much about their actual truth. The more rationalistically inclined tended to approach the myths as mythologized versions of real events: figures like Heracles or Dionysus or Romulus were assumed to have been real mortals whose exploits were embroidered by time — an easy thing to believe in a world were worship of deified Roman emperors was a legal duty.

This kind of de-mythologizing view — known as [Euhemerism](https://www.green-coursehub.com/research-blog/euhemerism) — was quite common in Greco-Roman historiography. It let’s you be skeptical that, say, Aeneas was a literal son of Aphrodite while still believing that he was a real prince who lived (our 1182 BC is the conventional date for most Greeks) and really escaped to Italy. Eusebius in particular isn’t necessarily the most deft practitioner of this kind of writing but most of the time he’s just quoting conventional Greek or Roman texts which assume the historicity of many figures we regard as purely mythological. His pagan contemporaries would usually have done the same



One thing that definitely does happen from around the 7th century onward is the contraction of literary culture that came with the collapse of the western Roman empire and the series of crises which beset the east. So if you’re dealing with an “early” Christian source between the collapse of the western Roman empire and the age of Charlemagne, you’re frequently dealing with somebody whose access to original texts was extremely limited. In this period only the wealthiest and most secure libraries (in the west, pretty much exclusively monastic libraries) could afford to maintain historical works which didn’t have much relevance to daily life. Early medieval literature depends very heavily on compilations of older sources which vary widely in quality and context. Often [truly outlandish medieval fables are really just garbled third-hand repetitions of something from a Greek or Roman text](https://www.quora.com/What-does-Theriocephaly-mean-Are-the-ancient-depictions-relating-to-theriocephaly-considered-true/answer/Steve-Theodore), taken out of context and repeated without much editing. A lucky library would might have a source like Isidore of Seville’s _[Etymologiae](https://sfponline.org/Uploads/2002/st%20isidore%20in%20english.pdf)_ _,_ a kind of proto-encyclopedia created with the explicit aim of preserving as much knowledge as possible in the diminished circumstances of the times. But in most of Europe the links to the ancient literary culture were pretty tenuous and “facts” tended to be recycled without much critical context.

This disconnect was never as severe in the Greek speaking world, where many of the ancient texts remained in fairly wide circulation and a certain degree of familiarity with ancient poetry and its mythological subject matter was expected of an educated person.
