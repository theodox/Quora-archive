Nowadays, any good gaming PC makes a pretty good 3d developer machine — the only real spec difference between a good gaming box and a good workstation is that the workstation should have as much fast RAM as you can afford. A big SSD is also going to help with overall throughput. You probably want a fairly recent, fast-ish chip (I use I7’s). More cores is nice — Unreal, in particular, is a core hog, and they help with the long compile times — but you don’t need a “workstation class” chip like a Xeon.

You don’t need a _better_  graphics card for 3d editing (Maya, UE, etc) than you would for running games, so you don’t need to shell out for a bleeding edge card. I generally by an NVidia card one notch down from the top of the line to avoid the huge tax they always put on graphics-card bragging rights. Autodesk will try to tell you that you need a ‘workstation’ card, but that’s mostly baloney. Our whole studio runs on gamer cards and most of the other ones I know of do too. Often a card which has just been ‘demoted’ by a recent product launch is a good deal.

The main exception to the ‘economize on graphics card’ rule is VR development — if you’re going to spend a lot of time in a headset, get the beefiest card you can afford; it will translate pretty directly into less time feeling seasick.

A gaming quality LCD monitor is also a good complement; the fast refresh times and color purity of IPS panels make them a good choice here instead of TN panels, but they are pricier. Costco recently had a $650 deal on [Acer Predator 27-inch ](http://amzn.to/2knzSlK)monitors, which are really sweet; you can get more pixels for less money by buying two 21″ monitors but the hassles of dual-monitor management can be frustrating, especially if you’re hopping in and out the game during development. I tend to spend pretty lavishly on monitors because they translate very directly into productivity and also they impact your view of your own work as an artist. If you buy a cheaper TN monitor, get a color calibrator and recalibrate your display so your stuff is not all off-color for other people with better displays.

There’s a a bit of wisdom in _not_ getting the fastest machine possible: a box that’s fast enough for productivity but not a real firebreather will keep you from doing things on the code or graphics side that nobody else can run.
