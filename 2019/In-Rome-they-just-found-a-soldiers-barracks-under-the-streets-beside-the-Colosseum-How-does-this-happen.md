If you want an example of how Rome really works, consider the case of the basilica of [San Clemente al Laterano](https://www.exurbe.com/tag/san-clemente/), a few blocks from the Colosseum. It’s a perfect microcosm of the endless cycle of reuse and rebuilding at the heart of every ancient city.

If you walk by San Clemente, it seems like a nondescript neo-Classical church: the visible parts were added during a renovation in 1719.

However when you step inside, you see something quite different: the interior of the church dates from the 1100’s, and sports a curious mix of renaissance decorations and high Byzantine style in a Romanesque building plan.

But — that’s just the surface.

When you go to the basement of the building you realize the floor you’ve been walking on is built over an entirely different building — a late-Roman basilica church which was built in the 4th century. The ‘foundation’ of the visible church is ground floor of the older building; the medieval builders had filled it with rubble and built on top of it (it was not rediscovered until 1857!).

_The fourth century basilica still preserves a few rare late-antique frescoes, like those at right._ 

However when archaeologists excavated the site they found another bricked-up staircase which led farther down. Beneath the fourth century church was a large Roman home from the second century, possibly a house-church from the days when Christians in Rome had to meet in secret. Excavations at this level revealed the second-century street level (two stories below the floor of the modern space). Excavators found a temple of Mithras and its temple school across the submerged “street” — though the archaeology suggests that the temple was itself a reworking of an older private home.

However this was not all: the house under San Clemente was itself built on an earlier structure, probably a warehouse or industrial building from the first century. This building, three stories under the modern street, is surrounded by retaining walls made of burnt brick: probably rubble from the Great Fire of 64, when Nero supposedly took up his “fiddle”.

We don’t actually know how far one could go down before hitting virgin earth: the best guess is that the foundations of the first-century _horreum_  extend down another 20 feet, and are likely built on earlier structures or the rubble of the great fire. To every side, you could start digging and you’d hit more basements, more filled-in foundations, and more buried streets. Sigmund Freud famously had a phobia of Rome’s layering. It’s a human termite mound, growing organically out of its own creation (and periodic destructions).

The practical mechanisms that encourage layering vary from place to place and time to time.

Fires, earthquakes and wars often level big swathes of a city, and it’s easier to rebuild on top of the ruins than to level them down to bare earth: when you’re trying to recover from a disaster, hauling wreckage away to a rubbish dump outside the city seems like a waste of time and energy. Floods deposit silt and level out old cavities (Rome was particularly vulnerable to floods - flood markers around the modern city are often one or more stories above street level). Abandoned buildings are overgrown by weeds and bushes, which destroy the structures and leave heavily matted rubble which is hard to clear away and easier to simply level and build over.

Last but not least, there’s garbage: in the days before mechanical transportation, rubbish dumps simply grew over time. In central Rome the hill known as [Monte Testaccio](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monte-testaccio) is nothing but an imperial landfill, made mostly of discarded jars for wine and oil.
