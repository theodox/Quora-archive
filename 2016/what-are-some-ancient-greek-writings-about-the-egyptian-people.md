Egypt was a topic of perennial interest for the Greeks, so there's quite a bit -- far more than about any of their neighbors except for Rome. Unfortunately most of the works are lost, surviving only in fragmentary quotations by other writers. I'll only cover sources that talk about "ancient" -- pre-Greek, pre-Persian -- Egypt, since there's a lot of stuff about the politics and culture of Greek-occupied Egypt which doesn't really concern Egyptian culture directly.

The biggest and most quotable source is [Herodotus,](http://www.ancient.eu/herodotus/) who devoted a large chunk of his history to Egypt and who visited the country in person in the 5th century BC. His work has been criticized on and off since antiquity -- including by the Egyptian priest [Manetho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho) who wrote historical and theological works in Greek around the 3rd century BC -- but it's readable and engaging and has shaped Western views of Egypt ever since. 

[Diodorus Siculus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus)wrote a history of the world around the time of Julius Caesar. He covered Egypt and preserves a lot of information from many earlier Greek writers whose works are now lost. The geographer [Strabo ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo)also used both earlier writings and his own observations of Egypt around the same time. The Roman scientist [Pliny the Elder](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/pliny-the-elder/pliny-the-elder-natural-history/), writing just after this time, also provides references to lost Greek 

An extremely influential late Greek writer on Egypt is [Plutarch.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch) His [Isis and Osiris](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html) is not only a very interesting look at Egyptian religion, it's also one of the founding texts of Hermetic traditions like Rosicrucianism. 

The Jewish historian [Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus), writing in Greek, discusses Egyptian history in several places where it intersects with Biblical history: he sometimes quotes and sometimes critiques Manetho, and identifies the Egyptian dynasty known as the [Hyksos ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyksos#Josephus)with the Israelites of Exodus. 

Last but not least, Egypt itself is a goldmine of Greek writing by Egyptians. The dry climate preserves papyrus, including a lot of humble day-to-day stuff like letters and bureaucratic paperwork. Archaeological finds like the [Oxyrhynchus Papyri ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyrhynchus_Papyri)let us see life in Egypt under Greek rule at a level of detail we don't have for any other period or place in antiquity. The best layperson's book on the subject is [Life in Egypt under Roman Rule](http://amzn.to/1RCCQ07)
