The only practical reasons to do it would be related to a career in education or possibly in a related field like museum work.

In the US, at any rate, the job market for PhD classicists at the university is small and not likely to grow in the near future (and it’s been a long time since a Master’s degree was enough to land a desirable job in higher ed in general).

There’s a somewhat larger market secondary educators, particularly those teaching Latin — if you can find a job teaching Latin in a public school, many public school contracts provide extra pay for teachers with MAs or PhDs — however you probably will also need an education degree and the costs of getting both are significant.

Of course, there’s the incalculable benefit of escaping the dreariness of the real world for a few years.

Unfortunately the costs of higher ed have so far outstripped the payoffs that, in purely economic terms, it’s a decision to be taken very carefully. Like a creative writing PhD it’s something you might want to approach with the standpoint ‘only if you must’ — if you can’t imagine being parted from the subject. On the plus side the internet has rendered self-conducted research, high-quality discussion, and self-publishing all incalculably easier.
