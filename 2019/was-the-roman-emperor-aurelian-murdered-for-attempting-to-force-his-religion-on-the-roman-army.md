No..

The best primary source is [Zosimus](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/zosimus/zosimus-new-history-1/zosimus-new-history-1.62/), who says he was murdered for very pedestrian personal reasons:

> [There was in the court a man named Eros, whose office was to carry out the answers of the emperor. This man had been for some fault threatened by the emperor, and put in great fear.

> [ Dreading therefore lest the emperor should realize his menaces by actions, he went to some of the guard, whom he knew to be the boldest men in the court. He told them a plausible story, and shewed them a letter of his own writing, in the character of the emperor (which he had long before learned to counterfeit), and persuading them first that they themselves were to be put to death, which was the meaning expressed by the letter, he endeavored to prevail on them to murder the emperor.

> The deception answered. Observing [Aurelian](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/aurelian/) to go out of the city with a small retinue, they ran out upon him and murdered him.

The other main witness is the notoriously unreliable [Historian Augusta](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Aurelian/2*.html#37) which tells a similar story with a somewhat hostile framing. But both sources agree the murder was not ideological.
