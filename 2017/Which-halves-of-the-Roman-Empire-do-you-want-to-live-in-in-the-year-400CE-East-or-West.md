__Go East, young man__ . This one is no contest.

We start the century in the west in under the reign of [Honorius](http://www.roman-empire.net/collapse/honorius.html), one of history’s great weasels (in 400, he’s 16 years old — and he remained a brat to the end of his reign).

_Honorius deserves that haircut._ 

Here’s some of the highlights you can expect:

__401–2:__  [Alaric the Visigoth](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alaric)— an on-again, off-again ally of the Romans in the 390’s — invades Italy (a rather rude thing to do, since he at least nominally held the rank of _magister militum per Illyriam —_ a theater command. He was beaten off by the best of the West Roman generals (and Honorius’ legal guardian, and future father-in-law) the half-Vandal [Flavius Stilicho](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Flavius-Stilicho), but only after extorting a large payoff.

_Stilicho (right), the “last of the Romans” — even though he was half Vandal by birth. Murdered (along with his wife and son) by Honorius_ 

__405__ : The invasion of [Radagaisus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radagaisus), Usually, in these answers, I’m at pains to point out that the Hollywood stereotype of fur-clad barbarian berserkers pouring out of the forests is bunk. Except this time: Radagaisus the Goth led an actual horde — contemporary sources count it between 200,000 and 400,000, though that’s vastly inflated — over the Danube and down through the Alps into northern Italy, ravaging everything in his path. He was also a fanatical pagan, who swore that he would to sacrifice the entire Roman Senate and burn the city itself to the ground in true summer-blockbuster fashion.

Stilicho took six months to gather the troops needed to stop him — by stripping the defenses of the Rhine and hiring every stray Hun, Vandal or even Visigoth to be found. Finally, the Romans brough the invaders to bay at [Fiesole](http://chimeramyth.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-kings-mountain-battle-of-faesulae.html) — though they had to resort to breaking a truce to do it.

__406__  The Rhine frontier was still denuded of troops. Roman troops, anyway: in 406 [the river line was breached decisively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_of_the_Rhine) by a mixed coalition of barbarians, who were proceeded to ravage the province without much opposition. In Britain - now cut off from the rest of the empire, the troops proclaimed their own [commander as a rival emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_(usurper)).

And we’re not at the good part yet.

_Constantine III - The coin doesn’t mention that the surrendered captive there is probably a Roman_ 

__407–8:__ Another rebel emperor is proclaimed, this time in Gaul: [Constantine III.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_III_(Western_Roman_Emperor)) Honorius — hoping for support against both the barbarians in Gaul and Constantine, plays footsie with Alaric (the invader of 402) — but won’t commit enough money to get an actual alliance in place.

__408__  Part of the footdragging over paying Alaric comes from Honorius’ increasing distrust of Stilicho, in whose shadow he’s lived his whole reign. Honorius has Stilicho executed on trumped-up charges, sparking an army mutiny. Honorius responds by having many of the allied troops of Stilicho’s army — and their families — murdered in in an anti-Germanic pogrom.

Alaric never got his payout and decides to take for himself what the Roman’s won’t give. His army — swollen with the survivors of Honorius’ pogrom — marches almost unopposed through Italy and lays siege to Rome itself.

For the next three the siege drags on as part of a complex military-political game between Honorius (hiding in the swamps of Ravenna), Alaric, Constantine, and the court in Constantinople. The main distinguishing note is the complete passivity of the western emperor, who never mounts more than a token defense of the city or even to lobby particularly hard for help from his equally feckless brother [Arcadius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadius) in Byzantium. [The long sorry story is related here](https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-sackings-of-Rome-in-the-year-410-by-the-Goths-and-Vandals-like-Were-they-organized-or-did-they-just-ride-through-the-city-slashing-burning-and-pillaging/answer/Steve-Theodore).

_Alaric is fiddled to while Rome burns_ 

Finally, in __410__ , Rome itself is sacked by Alaric. As barbarian sacks go it was surprisingly mild. But Rome — which by now was of a cultural and religious center than a vibrant economic or political force — will never recover.

But wait! There’s _more!_ 

Honorius — without much of an army — recognized Constantine III as co-emperor around the time he had Stilicho killed. But his luck rubbed off on Constantine, who faced revolts of his own. As the Vandals broke through the Pyrenees, Constantine’s general [Gerontius ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontius_(general))switched sides, proclaimed himself emperor, and attacked Constantine’s rear. Constantine — in true 5th century fashion — responded by attacking his “co-emperor” Honorius in __411__ , but was defeated.

_Constantius III - competent. So, short-lived_ 

Honorius found another protector in the future [Constantius III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantius_III), who defeated first Gerontius and then Constantine in short order (in a typically Honorian touch, Constantine was killed after being promised a safe conduct and having taken monastic vows).

Constantius would be the real ruler of the emperor for the next decade. Compared to Honorius, he was pretty good. He put down [yet another would-be emperor in Gaul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jovinus). He actually drove the Visigoths (demoralized by Alaric’s sudden death) out of Italy in 412. He then turned them loose on the Vandals in Spain, making him the [godfather of modern Spain](http://earlyworldhistory.blogspot.com/2012/01/visigoth-kingdom-of-spain.html). The various barbarians of the west were provided with a figleaf of legal legitimacy and, on paper at least, the empire was intact once more.

_Galla Placidia - consort of both a barbarian king and a Roman emperor._ 

For his troubles, Constantius became - briefly - the legitimate co-emperor in __421__ . He died only seven months after his ascension, however, and his wife [Galla Placidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galla_Placidia) — the femme fatale of the 5th century — and his young son [Valentinian III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentinian_III) had to flee to Constantinople to escape the attentions of uncle Honorius (gossip says the were kind of creepy, cynical historians think perhaps they were political… but they were most unwelcome attentions either way).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5420adbb66e332ba131b94df63b70b28-c)

_Galla Placidia and young Valentinian fleeing east_ 

Honorius finally went to his long-overdue rest in __423__ , leaving a fatally weakened empire and no obvious heir.

If you’re still not convinced…

For the next 50 years the western empire was ruled mostly by puppets; the real power lay in barbarian kingmakers, not the nominal government. And the state was crumbling fast; the characteristic figure of this time is not an emperor but the sinister master-manipulator [Ricimer,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricimer) who enthroned and deposed more than one emperor but cared very little for governance.

_Aetius (right) beat Attila the freaking Hun in a fair fight. But even that didn’t give you job security in the 5th century. Another “Last of the Romans”_ 

The 5th century West produced a couple of heroes — but the tone of the times was that they were tragic heroes.

[Flavius Aetius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavius_Aetius#Origins_and_family) (one of this period’s many candidates for the sad title “Last of the Romans”) beat the unstoppable [Attila the Hun](http://www.ancient.eu/Attila_the_Hun/) at [Chalons](http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/attila-the-hun-the-battle-of-the-catalaunian-plains/) in 451; by 454 he’d been assassinated by Valentinian, who must have picked up something from Uncle Honorius after all. However he lacked uncle’s talent for survival: he himself was murdered the next year when Aetius’ soldiers stood by and refused to intervene against his own assassins.

The romantic lead of the century was [Majorian](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Majorian), certainly the last good emperor of the West — but he lasted only four years before being deposed and murdered by Ricimer.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dfe868313f942028a387a12c8bfd9b2f-c)

_Majorian had a great reputation in the historical literature, but less luck in the visual arts. The last of the last of the Romans. Any century that mass-produces tragic heroes like this is to be avoided._ 

For completeness’ sake, it’s worth mentioning that life in the east was no picnic. The Huns invaded as far south as Thermopylae; Constantinople was devastated by earthquake and plague; the orthodox Church split into warring halves centered in Constantinople and Alexandria; there were plots, coups, assassinations….

…and it was _still better_ than the alternative.

And you think 2016 offered bad choices.
