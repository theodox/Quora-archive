The Greeks were aware of the distant origin of silk as early as about the 5th century BC; the first mention of the Σῆρες (Seres or “silk people”) is in [Ctesias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctesias), an early Greek geographer from the Persian empire. Ctesias’s work survives today only in scattered quotations, so there’s not enough information there to know if the “silk people” were clearly identified with the Chinese, or if the Greeks were thinking of one of the many intermediary nations along the route to the east. The fact that the describes them like this:

> The Seres and the inhabitants of upper India are said to have an exceedingly large physique as some of them are found to be thirteen cubits [= 6m] tall, and they live for more than 200 years

makes it seem unlikely the information was first hand. It may also reflect confusion about the ultimate origin of silk, since the Greeks usually described northern Indians and some of the steppes peoples, such as the [Saka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saka), as particularly tall and imposing.

After Ctesias, there’s no literary evidence until around the first century. However there are a few bits of archaeological evidence attesting to ongoing contact. For example the [Sampul Tapestry](http://www.messagetoeagle.com/sampul-tapestry-mysterious-silk-road-textile-linked-to-hellenistic-kingdoms-of-central-asia-and-tarim-basin/), from modern Xinjiang, probably dates from the heyday of the [Greco-Bactrian Kingdom,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom) a central Asian state that arose out of the fragments of Alexander’s empire and sat on what would later become the Silk Road.

From about 130 BC the Greeks in Egypt began sailing to India using the monsoon winds. This opened up a[ flourishing trade](https://www.quora.com/Did-any-Roman-during-the-Roman-Republic-or-Empire-set-foot-in-India), so adventurous Greek and Roman traders could be found many places in Indochina, Myanmar and southern China. The Romans and Greeks now distinguished between the Seres of northern China, reached overland by caravans, and the [Sinae ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sinae)who were reached by the sea routes. The Roman-era sea trade came up the rivers from Burma or sailed around to Guangzhou, where Roman glassware has been found by archeologists

There were [fairly regular commercial contacts after the first century or so](https://www.quora.com/When-and-where-did-the-first-direct-contact-between-Han-China-and-Rome-occur/answer/Steve-Theodore), including individuals who claimed, at any rate, to be ambassadors from Rome or China or vice-versa — though most modern scholars think there was no regular diplomatic contact. The distances were great and the powers between Rome and China worked hard to retain a monopoly on the connection. So, Chinese sources on Rome and Roman sources on China both tend to be pretty vague and only moderately accurate. Nevertheless the Romans and Chinese were certainly aware of each other’s existence and each tended to recognize the other as a ‘civilized’ rather than a primitive society.

The best source in English, with a collection of translated Chinese accounts, is probably [China and the Roman Orient](https://archive.org/details/chinaandromanor01hirtgoog)
