There are really two or three very ways to look at this.

Most of the lurid stories that everybody knows are related via [Tacitus](http://www.johndclare.net/AncientHistory/Agrippina_Sources7.html) or [Suetonius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/suetonius/12caesars/nero*.html). Both of these are written after the fact and so neither has much incentive to paint Nero in particularly favorable colors. Suetonius loves tabloid stories and Tacitus was an aristocratic conservative and anti-monarchist so both had no reason to be kind. Generally Nero was unpopular with the upper classes—sometimes because they were nostalgic for the Republic, but more often because his informers and secret police targeted the senatorial elite rather than ordinary Romans. Suetonius names 22 Senators killed by Nero’s enforcers: Tiberius accounted for 36, but reigned twice as long.

Interestingly, though, there is pretty good evidence that Nero was popular with his less exalted subjects. Some of the policies that the aristocrats disliked — tax cuts, for example, or limitations on lawyer’s fees — were popular with ordinary Romans. The upper classes were scandalized by his willingness to appear on stage as an entertainer: actors in antiquity were usually ranked with prostitutes in terms of social status. However for lower class Romans his sponsorship of extravagant games and festivals was popular, even if his personal performances were usually regarded as farcical (he is said to have packed the stands with armed supporters to encourage applause). Most tellingly, when Nero died two of the four claimants for the throne in the [Year of the Four Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Four_Emperors) ([Otho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otho) and [Vitellius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitellius)) tried to position themselves as “Neronians”: Otho accepted the surname “Nero”, and Vitellius tried to [revive perfomances of Nero’s music](https://www.quora.com/How-did-Neros-poem-The-Sack-of-Troy-go).

The last point of view comes from the east. Greek provincials didn’t care much about the fate of Roman aristocrats but they appreciated Nero’s enthusiasm for Greek culture. His participation in the Olympics was perhaps a bit of a joke (the games, at least so the surviving records say, were rigged to ensure he won: the Olympics of 67 were later stricken from the records). Over the three decades after Nero’s death [three different false Neros cropped up as would-be claimants to the throne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_Redivivus_legend). As late as the fifth century there was still a legend that Nero was not dead but merely in hiding, awaiting his chance to return: St. Augustine remarked

> It is thought by some that Nero will rise again as Antichrist; others think that he is not dead and that he still lives on as a legendary figure, of the same age at which he died, and will be restored to his Kingdom. However the stubbornness of this belief seems remarkable to me.

So, clearly, _somebody_  liked Nero.
