The Romans regarded the fasces — and for that matter, the word _dictator_  — as symbols of liberty, not tyranny.

__The traditional meanings__ 

The fasces were the symbol of legal order. Every Roman magistrate was accompanied by [lictors, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lictor)who carried the fasces to let people know that they were officers of the law. The rods and axes stood for the magistrates power to administer corporal or capital punishment. However a Roman would also point out that the rods and axes were bound into a bundle, and useless as actual weapons — they were symbols of the power of law, not instruments of coercion. Kings and tyrants needed armed bodyguards, to subdue any possible challenge — in a properly run Republic, the symbolic power of the law was enough to compel respect.

_A lictor. The fact that he wears a toga — civilian formalwear — rather than armor is another symbol of the fundamentally law-bound self image of the Roman republic_ 

Roman dictatorship was also based in legal order, not arbitrary power. The central value of the Republic was the regular rotation of people in power — all Roman officers were elected for one year terms, and always in groups so that no individual was too powerful. But in an emergency, when it was important to have a unified chain of command, an ‘emergency king’ was appointed: a dictator. The essence of the office was precisely that it was for the duration of the emergency — a good Roman who was appointed to the dictatorship was supposed to resign his powers as soon as the emergency was passed. The Romans loved stories about dictators like [Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Quinctius_Cincinnatus), who was so poor that he could not afford help when plowing his fields but who quietly returned to his life of poverty after his brief stint of absolute power.

__18th and 19th century revival__ 

In the 18th and 19th centuries, when most of Europe was still ruled by kings, the fasces were a symbol of elective government and obedience to law. The American and French revolutions were both steeped in the symbols of the Roman republic. Stories like that of Cincinnatus were well known, particularly to those who believed in representative government. George Washington named his veteran’s association [Society of the Cincinnati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_Cincinnati) to underline his own principled willingness to step down from power.

The French revolution adopted many Roman trappings, including the fasces as well:

Napoleon even ruled as “first consul” before he dropped the republican facade and ruled as emperor. British parliamentarians were often sculpted in togas. In 19th century Europe and America, Roman trappings were the main visual language of democracy.

__Modern meanings__ 

The fasces and the word dictator only got their modern meanings in the 20th century, thanks primarily to [Benito Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini). [Many Italian activist groups called themselves fasci,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascio) meaning “league” or “union;” Mussolini’s [Partito Nazionale Fascista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Fascist_Party) adopted the Roman fasces as symbol — it was a pun on the name but also a [canny piece of branding](https://www.mcgill.ca/classics/files/classics/2012-13-09.pdf), since it was designed to signal his devotion to national greatness in the Roman mold.

It’s fair to say that the original symbolism of the fasces was hijacked by Mussolini: a minor, if galling piece of collateral damage among the many left by Fascism. However there’s some comfort in the fact that few people nowadays recognize the symbol at all, so the perversion of its meaning isn’t obvious to most of us.
