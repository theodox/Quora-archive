Callisthenes does not survive intact, alas.

You can find surviving quotations in volume IIB, entry 124 of the [Fragmente der Griechischen Historiker](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/cluster/Jacoby%20Online) (“FGrH” or “Jacoby”, as it’s known in the biz) under _Kallisthenes von Olynth_ . Scandalously the online version is paywalled but most decent university libraries will have the print version. Or. you can sign up at [archive.org](http://archive.org) for free and borrow it from [here](https://archive.org/details/diefragmentederg0000jaco_w9g3) (one hour at a time…) The text is in Greek with German commentary — its divided into two types of reference: “T” for testimonia (quotations _about_  Callisthenes) and “F” for fragments (quotations or paraphrases of Callisthenes). Here’s a screen grab to give you the idea:

For the most part, Callisthenes’ observations end up in Arrian, Plutarch and Curtius.

If you’re not up on Greek, [This article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24668207?seq=1) gives a decent survey of the state of Callisthenes studies, such as they are; it’s in JSTOR (again, paywalled) but for me anyway it appears accessible from a free account not tied to a university login. [This one](https://casa-kvsa.org.za/legacy/1963/AC06-08-Atkinson.pdf) is but is a bit old fashioned; it’s still written in the shadow of W.W. Tarn, whose approach to all things Alexander is now seen (justly or not is another question) as a overly romantic. [This one’s also useful](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/callisthenes-of-olynthus/).

One las thting: you’ll need to be careful when checking references — its still not uncommon for people to cite _pseudo-Callisthenes_ when the mean “the anonymous author of the Alexander Romance” which used to be attributed to the real Callisthenes. Ps-Callisthenes is available online [here](http://www.attalus.org/info/alexander.html)
