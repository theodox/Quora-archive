# How much did Roman citizens and subjects know about the administration of the Roman Empire? If, for example, I traveled to Chester in 79AD, would most people know the name of their emperor?

The name of the emperor? Almost certainly.

In 79 AD this would be particularly true for Chester. The “city” didn’t really exist yet — it was still a newly-constructed [Roman fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva_Victrix) and only beginning to accumulate a civilian shell around its militry core. The name “Chester” itself is just a corruption of _castrum,_ a military camp. So, in this early period the legions would have been the primary symbol of the empire’s presence: and they marched with effigies of the emperor everywhere they went. The daily ritual of the camp included public prayers on behalf of the emperor.*

In 79 the odds that a visitor to Chester would actually _be_  a Roman citizen are quite low: the area was only recently conquered and the whole reason the fortress-city was there was to keep an eye on the restive native population.

There were native Britons who were citizens at this point: most of them will have been tribal chieftains who were Roman allies, along with a handful of native auxiliaries who had served their time in the Roman military. All of these will have had a pretty good idea who the emperor was, since the tradition was that the new citizen took the name of the reigning emperor as a Latin family name: you’d meet a lot of people like [Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Claudius_Cogidubnus), a Roman chieftain who got his citizenship under Claudius (or possibly Nero, who used some of the same nomenclature). Eventually, in 212, the entire free population would become citizens — but that’s far in the future.**

__Civilian life__ 

If you’re curious about more settled places in this period, the answer is still yes although the picture is less militarized. We don’t have the best evidence for the west, but in the eastern half of the empire the emperor’s name was ubiquitous in ordinary affairs. It’s reasonable to assume something similar — though perhaps less intrusive — in the more settled parts of Roman Britain and certainly in longer-established parts of the west, like Gaul.

The capital of Roman Britain at his point in time was [Camulodunum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camulodunum), that is, Colchester. The center of the town hosted [a large temple dedicated to the deified emperor Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Claudius,_Colchester), which would also have functioned as the center of ritual observances on behalf of the reigning emperor.

This was probably the largest civilian building in the British Isles, so it was hard to miss. In eastern provinces the temple of the imperial cult was usually the site of public ritual connected with the emperor and his family: celebrations relating to the emperor’s birthday, the anniversary of his accession, the birth of an heir or a significant even were held here. These were not just parties: in the east, at least, they often involved an obligatory [oath of loyalty](http://philipharland.com/greco-roman-associations/oath-of-loyalty-to-augustus-by-paphlagonians-and-roman-businessmen-3-bce/).

Priesthood in the imperial cult was a coveted honor, a mark of important social and political distinction — any ambitious provincial would have competed eagerly to get an appointment to [the board of magistrates who oversaw the cult](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Augustales.html). Sponsoring public events (festivals, games, religious observances and the like) in the emperor’s honor was a good way to ‘campaign’ for a role in the imperial priesthood — this, of course, meant that Romanized Britons expended a good deal of their own money and energy in propagating a positive image of the emperor, even among people who didn’t necessarily interact with the Roman state directly.

__Business__ 

If you did involve yourself with the state then the emperor was also omnipresent. Legal matters were sealed by oaths, taken in the name of the emperor,*** so mundane matters such as wills, divorces, land transfers and taxation typically involved the emperor. Roman Egypt has produced a wealth of material showing how routine this was in the east — we don’t have the corresponding information for Roman Britain, but the likelihood is that the Roman state obtruded far less into into daily life in the unsettled conditions of 79. Over time, however, the spread of Roman law into matters of law, commerce and inheritance would have pushed a lot of ordinary folk into contact with the emperor.

In later times the primary administrative center of any Roman city was a basilica — an administrative building which served as a courthouse, city hall, and community center. It was built in a form most of us would recognizes as a church — except that where a church has an altar the basilica would have an image of the emperor, presiding symbolically over all transactions.

Last but not least, it’s important to remember these:

The biggest source of ready cash in Britain will have been the legions — not merely the pay of the soldiers, but the large economy which sprang up around them. British tribes and kingdoms produced their own coins before the conquest, but the Roman specie gradually replaced them — carrying the image of the various emperors with it. Even non-political people learned to recognize the portraits, because different emperors were more or less committed to honest weights of metal in their coinage — a coin of Nero’s contained about 10% less silver than this coin of Titus, so it paid to learn to distinguish one Roman profile from another.

__TLDR__ 

To sum up: In any urban area, the Roman emperor was a ubiquitous presence. It would probably be possible to find people in the countryside for whom this was at best a distant rumor (just as it’s possible to find people today who are not sure who the sitting president is) but that was an index of social isolation and poverty more than a mark of ordinary life.



* At least nominally on his behalf, rather than prayers _to_  the emperor — though many provincials seem not to have really observed that distinction. The new emperor [Domitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domitian) (starting in 81) would go on to convert those ‘prayers for’ into ‘prayers to’ rather assertively. 
** Most of those new citizens took the name _Aurelius —_ if there’s any truth at all to the legend of king Arthur, aka [Ambrosius Aurelianus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrosius_Aurelianus), his family will have gotten their citizenship in 212.

***Again, the official idea was that the oaths were taken in the name of the emperor’s _genius_ or “guardian spirit” — but the distinction was a bit too fine for many people.
