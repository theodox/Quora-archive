It's a very mixed bag, it's a very small and not super commercial genre so we're picking up experience in how to make these kinds of games quite slowly. However there are a few:


[The Audio Adventure Game](http://www.blindsidegame.com/)

[Papa Sangre](http://www.papasangre.com/)

[The Nightjar](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-nightjar/id431598741?mt=8)

[INCUS GAMES](http://incusgames.com/) (cf. 3 Monkeys)


And here's a couple of background articles:
