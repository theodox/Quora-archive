It certainly was not an accident. It was part of a very specific set of historical circumstances.

__Historical ties__ 

The first factor was the fact that there was already a long tradition in Greece of regarding Egypt as a source of ancient wisdom. Herodotus (writing more than a century before Alexander's day) was only citing conventional wisdom when he wrote

> In fact, the names of nearly all the gods came to Hellas from Egypt. For I am convinced by inquiry that they have come from foreign parts, and I believe that they came chiefly from Egypt. Except the names of Poseidon and the Dioscuri, as I have already said, and Hera, and Hestia, and Themis, and the Graces, and the Nereids, the names of all the gods have always existed in Egypt.

It's not entirely clear what he _means_  by this, since elsewhere he clearly gives recognizable Egyptian names for several god and he uses the ordinary Greek names all the time. However he's clearly channeling a tradition that some important aspect of Greek religious tradition stemmed from Egypt.* The underlying truth of that connection is [hotly debated](https://www.quora.com/What-if-any-is-the-part-of-truth-to-Martin-Bernals-Black-Athena) in modern scholarship, but when Alexander arrived in Egypt it was something an educated Greek would probably accept without question. 

__Politics__ 

A second and very important element was the disastrous interaction between the Persians and the Egyptians. Although the Persians in general were regarded as tolerant conquerors they were never able to conciliate the Egyptians. The conquest of [Cambyses (559-530 BC) ](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/cambyses-ii/) was marred by both bitter fighting and Cambyses' sacrilegious killing of the Apis bull, which infuriated the Egyptians.** The Egyptians never learned to love their Persian overlords. 

Alexander was very well aware of that history, and he used it very deliberately. Only a generation before Alexander the Spartan king [Agesilaus II ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agesilaus_II)led a Greek mercenary army in the service of the rebel Pharaoh [Nectanebo II,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectanebo_II) who briefly drove the Persians out of Egypt (360-342 BC) and was the last native Egyptian to sit on the throne of the Pharaohs. 

So Alexander knew and was eager to exploit the resentments of the Egyptians against the Persians. After routing the Persian army he made a famous [pilgrimage to the oracle at Siwa,](#) carefully calculated to position him as a friend of traditional Egyptian religion and culture. When he emerged from the oasis and announced that he was the "son of [Amun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amun#Greece)" he was donning the mantle of traditional Egypt in a very self conscious way. His coins even depicted him with Amun's traditional ram's horns:

Interestingly this was not _just_  a spontaneous bit of politicking on Alexander's part -- the connection with Amun -- whom the Greeks regard as Zeus -- was already quite well established before Alexander came to Egypt. The Spartans -- among the most traditional of Greeks -- were particularly devoted to the same oracle at Siwa. And even Alexander's coin is clearly based on the coins of the Greek colony Cyrene in Libya:

which had been featuring Zeus-Ammon on its coinage for about 150 years. Alexander also patronized traditional Egyptian art as part of his program: Here he is (on the left) as depicted in a temple at Luxor

After Alexander's death, his successors in Egypt the [Ptolemies](http://www.livius.org/articles/dynasty/ptolemies/) made a point of continuing to patronize the traditional Egyptian religion -- sponsoring Egyptian festivals, building Egyptian temples, and adopting the ritual and regalia of Pharaohs when dealing with their Egyptian subjects -- even though they retained a vivid sense of their Hellenic identity among their Greek courtiers.

_This temple -- now recontructed in Madrid -- was repeatedly restord and expanded by the Ptolemies_ 

The temples, which would have been the natural focus of opposition to a foreign dynasty, were generally loyal supporters of the Ptolemies for the next three centuries. The Ptolemies even sponsored the creation of a new cult, that of [Serapis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapis) -- a kind of hellenistic gloss on the traditions associated with Osiris -- which was deliberately intended to unite their Greek and Egyptian subjects.

_Serapis_ 

The project succeeded quite well, even spreading outside of Egypt in the Roman period.





*In this connection it's worth noting that Greek mythology always claimed that the royal house of Argos was Egyptian in origin; For example the famous hero Perseus was a 4th generation descendant of "King [Aegyptus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegyptus)," 
** Some modern scholars think this story is Egyptian propaganda -- but it still illustrates the deep hostility between the Egyptian traditionalists and the Persians
