This doesn't sound like a very historically-minded backgrounder.


For starters, it's a very made-up name: Pius and Augustus are both pretty serious terms in Latin -- naming your child that would be like naming your kid "Pope Holy" today. The reference is probably an echo of the phrase _pius Aeneas --_ Aeneas, the hero of the Roman national epic, was often called _pius,_ meaning "completely devoted to duty." A few emperors used it on their coins etc as an (immodest) announcement of their own virtues, or more commonly as praise for a popular predecessor. _Augustus_  means 'the most wise and respectable" or something similar; it's a title rather than a personal name.

The best opportunity for military glory in the area comes a bit later, in 20 BC when Augustus led a two-pronged push into Parthian territory - one army moving east through Syria and the other south through Armenia. This didn't climax in a big battlefield victory but it did force the Parthians to return the lost legionary standards from the disaster at [Carrhae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carrhae) in 56 and [Mark Antony's Parthian debacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony%27s_Parthian_War) in 37. This was one of Augustus most cherished victories and probably what the original writer was thinking of.

 The only other opportunity for derring-do in this period would be the [Battle of Mount Gindarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mount_Gindarus), which was a major Roman victory over the Parthians in 38, but which is largely forgotten because of Anthony's lousy performance the next year. However the game character would have been in his early teens for that one.

Maybe it's a rounding error due to aggressive compression on the 40 megs of memory on a Gamecube.
