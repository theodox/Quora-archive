Iain Pears [Dream of Scipio](http://smile.amazon.com/The-Dream-Scipio-Iain-Pears/dp/1573229865/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_1968490042?_encoding=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0&pf_rd_p=1968490042&pf_rd_s=smile-campaign&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=1573229865&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=0QTA3P11RW85JPSC70A2) is great book on both the literary and the historical fiction level;

L. Sprague De Camp's [Lest Darkness Fall](http://www.amazon.com/Lest-Darkness-Fall-Related-Stories-ebook/dp/B004Q9U4S4) is a fun time-travel novella with a good foundation of research

Robert Graves' [Count Belisarius](http://www.amazon.com/Count-Belisarius-Robert-Graves-ebook/dp/B00J4RX1E2) covers the same territory in a more conventional form, wth lots of salacious Byzantine gossip thrown in.

On the non-fiction side [Society and the Holy in Late Antiquity](http://smile.amazon.com/Society-Holy-Antiquity-Peter-Brown/dp/0520068009/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1424877919&sr=1-1&keywords=society+and+the+holy+in+late+antiquity) by Peter Brown is the most important modern study of the period; it's a useful counterpoint to the 'Decline and Fall' school of Gibbon. [The Barbarian West 400 - 1000](http://www.amazon.com/Barbarian-West-400-J-Wallace-Hadrill/dp/0631202927) is OK, it's useful for tracking the chaos of competing tribes , kingdoms and roman remnants but can be very... dense...

Original sources for this period are kind of tough, they are usually pretty formulaic and not alwasy fun reads. The wiki article on [Gregory of Tours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_of_Tours) for example shows how hard it is to pick up a 5th, 6th or 7th century source and read it without background.
