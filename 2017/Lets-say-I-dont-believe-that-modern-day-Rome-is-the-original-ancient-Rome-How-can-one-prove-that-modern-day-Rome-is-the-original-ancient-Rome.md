# Let's say I don't believe that modern day Rome is the original ancient Rome. How can one prove that modern day Rome is the original ancient Rome?

_Note: As originally worded, the question included a quote from Petrarch about how small Rome was during a visit and 1337 and implied that “Rome” was a hoax cooked up by Renaissance writers and late-medieval Popes._ 

Wow, this one’s a poser. Inquiring minds want to know!

Let’s start with what Petrarch [actually said when he went to Rome](http://www2.idehist.uu.se/distans/ilmh/Ren/ren-pet-letter-rome.htm):

> For the present I know not where to start, overwhelmed as I am by the wonder of so many things and by the greatness of my astonishment. There is one thing that I do want to tell you, however, which happened contrary to what you expected. As I recall, you used to dissuade me from coming for a particular reason, which was that if the ruins of the city did not correspond to its fame and to the impressions I had received from books, my love for it would diminish. I, too, although burning with desire, willingly used to postpone my visit, fearing that what I had imagined in my mind my eyes would belittle at the moment of reality which is always injurious to a reputation. Such reality I am happy to say diminished nothing and instead increased everything. In truth Rome was greater, and greater are its ruins than I imagined.

It’s certainly true the Rome in 1337 was a shadow of its imperial past. But Petrarch — one of the best travelled men in Europe (he’s today sometimes called [”the first tourist](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/petrarch)” — was no country bumpkin to mistake the ruins of of old mill or disused quarry for the bones of a great city. There was certainly _something_  there.

I’m going to skip the rest of the literary evidence from the years between the end of the Roman empire in the west and 1337 — there is so much that I can’t even begin to do it justice. Popes, emperors, and diplomats from foreign lands all went to the same spot and left records of their visits. And it’s worth pointing out that the Byzantine empire — still going strong in 1337, and self-confident in it’s belief that _it_  was the direct continuation of the Roman empire — was a major force in Italian politics through the 10th century and they never mentioned the disappearance of Rome.

But forget all that — file it away as a (vast) collection of forgeries if you want to. You still have to confront three extremely protuberant facts.

__The Aurelian Walls__ 

The [Aurelian Walls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian_Walls) were built in the 270’s by emperor [Aurelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian) when Italy was under threat from barbarians to the north. They enclose an area of almost 14 square kilometers. By comparison the 13th century [Wall of Philip II Augustus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_Philip_II_Augustus)in Paris surrounded only 2.5 or so; the walls of Florence — finished in 1331, just before Petrarch visited “Rome” enclosed a bit more than 6… and they took more than 50 years to build. It’s inconceivable that any early medieval statelet could have afforded to build walls enclosing area two to three times the size of the biggest cities in Europe just to house a granary and a castle.

And, _just coincidentally,_ those huge walls enclose seven hills, and straddle the Tiber. Odd.

__Roads__ 

It’s also interesting that an insignificant hamlet would just happen to sit at the crossroads of two gigantic engineering feats.

The famous Roman road network stretched all over Europe - but for _some strange reason_  this one spot on the Tiber with seven hills in it is the nexus of 13 of them. By contrast even Constantinople only got 8.

And for confirmation from Petrarch’s day there’s the [Tabula Peutingeriana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_Peutingeriana), a medieval copy of a Roman map done in the 1200’s shows the city right there at the intersection of all those roads.

Down the river in that image is [Ostia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica) — which was actually well inland by the time the map was made due to the silting up of the Tiber. The map also includes Pompeii — which had been completely buried by the eruption of mt. Vesuvius in 79 AD. Only one hell of a conspiracy could get those bits incorporated into a map copied in a French monastery in 1266… unless maybe it was just a copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy of a Roman original.

__Aqueducts__ 

Finally… _coincidence?…_ this same little burg also sits at the intersection of 11 major [aqueducts](http://www.ancient.eu/aqueduct/), capable of delivering 300,000,000 gallons of water a day: enough for a city of a million people and running collectively about 500 miles in length.

Most of these aqueducts were cut in the wars of the sixth century, but in 1331 a couple were still in daily use — for example, the [Aqua Virgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Virgo) (which would be renovated in the 1500s) and the [Aqua Traiana ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Traiana#Distribution_of_Aqua_Traiana_within_Rome)which would be renovated in the 1600s).

The outlay of manpower needed to build these enormous structures — both above ground and bored for miles underground — was far beyond the resources of any state in medieval Europe. Not to mention the fact that they’re built with [Roman concrete,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_concrete) a material which was forgotten until the 18th century.
