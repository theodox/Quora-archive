# Did the pharaoh of Egypt or other ancient rulers espouse a similar "universal monarchy" ambition as later emperors in Rome and China?

The official title of Sargon of Akkad ([the ancient one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad), not the internet one) was 𒈗 𒆠𒅖𒉌𒋾____ __[šar kiššati](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23297238)__ , “King of Everything” — more commonly translated as “King of the Universe”.

Most of the more ambitious Mesopotamian monarchs who followed used the same or similar titles — it was _de rigeur_  for any self-respecting Assyrian king to be King of the Universe. Some of the more pedantic ones clarified it with __[šarru kibrat 'arbaim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Four_Corners)__ __,__ “King of the four corners of the world.”

The universalizing titles were inherited by the Persians and then by Alexander and his successors. The last known claimant to that title was Antiochus I of the Seleucid Empire, though it’s likely that the usage lingered on longer than that.

_The_ _[Antiochus Cylinder](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/mesopotamian-chronicles-content/antiochus-cylinder/)_ _, from Babylon in 268 BC (roughly two millennia after Sargon) dubs the Macedonian-Persian Antiochus “the mighty king, king of the world, king of Babylon, king of all countries,” Photo:_ _[Bert Van Der Spek](https://www.livius.org/pictures/a/tablets/antiochus-cylinder-3/)_ 

Interestingly, the pharaohs of Egypt didn’t use quite such bombastic titles. Typically a pharaoh sported no less [than five regnal names](https://pharaoh.se/titles-and-epithets), generally chosen to emphasize the close relationship between the king and the gods. The most common claim of sovereignty was _nb-tꜢwy, “_ Lord of the Two Lands,_“_ that is, of Upper and Lower Egypt, the only two lands that really mattered.

However sometimes that could be stretched a bit further: [Thuthmose I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_I), Egypt’s greatest warrior-pharaoh, [said this about his own reign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombos_Stela):

> His appearance as Chief of the two lands__in order to rule what the sun disc has encircled__ , South and also North , namely the parts of Horus and Seth — uniting the Two lands, as he sits on the thrones of Geb

It’s hard to know exactly what these very abstract phrases conveyed to their hearers — but given Thuthmose’s outsized ambition he might have been in a King-of-Everything frame of mind. He was certainly king of everything from roughly the border of modern Turkey well down into Sudan.

Nevertheless it’s probably not an over-generalization to say that the Mesopotamian ideology of rulership frequently ventured into the ideal of a universal monarchy, where the Egyptian version shied away from that kind of claim. It may have a lot to do with the Egyptian sense that Egypt was the only place that really matters: being king of the universe would only be a minor upgrade if you were already beloved of Ra and lord of the two lands, so it may just not have been worth the hassle.

TLDR: the Mesopotamian ideology of kingship was at least theoretically universal for two thousand years. The Egyptian version was conventionally parochial even though the pharaohs were divine.
