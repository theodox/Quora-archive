It almost sorta-kinda happened in real life. But it didn’t end well.

The leading Roman aristocrat of this era was __[Crescentius the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescentius_the_Younger)__ , who often referred to himself as “consul of Rome.” He usually pretended to be the local representative of the _current_ emperor, __[Emperor Otto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor)__ __,__ who inherited the imperial throne when he was still a child. Otto’s mother was __empress__ __[Theophanu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophanu)__ __,__ a byzantine Princess from the _other_  Roman empire — the one that was still going strong in Constantinople.

While Otto was young his mother, as regent, more or less looked the other way at Crescentius’ pretensions: she had bigger things to worry about. However when Otto grew up he decided to settle matters decisively with Crescentius — who, among other things, had imprisoned one Pope ([John XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_XIV)) and chased another ([John XV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_XV)) out of Rome. In 996 Otto — at 16 — came down to Italy with enough of his barons in tow that Crescentius surrendered and “retired,” stripped of his quasi-Roman titles…

At least, for another year or so, until a revolt in the Slavic parts of Saxony drew Otto’s attention.

In 997 Crescentius took another shot: he chased out _another_ Pope ([Gregory V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_V)) and installed one of his own ([John XVI ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipope_John_XVI)). However this was really just a local feudal rebellion, not at real “Roman” revival. Crescentius’ support was mostly limited to the nobility of Lazio and note even all of those. In the immediate vicinity of the city he and his supporters were very powerful, but they had no real support outside their own feudal domains. Certainly there was no lingering “Roman” patriotism they could embody in contrast to the emperor himself: the institutional heir of Charlemagne, more or less a peer to the emperor in Constantinople, and also the biggest feudal magnate in Europe.

So, when Otto beat the Slavs and returned to Italy, Crescentius was captured — having holed up in the [Castel Sant'Angelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_Sant%27Angelo) — and executed.

But — it turned out somebody else wanted to revive the empire: the emperor himself.

Otto was a vigorous and ambitious emperor who wanted to make the empire more Roman and more centralized; of course, as the son of a Byzantine princess his ideas of proper emperorship owed more to the court of Constantinople than to any memory of the Caesars. Otto and his own new pope ([Sylvester II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sylvester_II) — the man who brought Arabic numerals to Europe) settled in to Rome in 999. Otto tried to revive a lot of imperial pomp — though his models were more Carolingian and Byzantine than classical. He built a palace on the Palatine, talked of reinstituting the Senate, and revived Roman civil law. Sylvester [wrote to Otto](https://cristianizacioneslavos.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/althoff-otto-iii.pdf)

> You are our ‘emperor of the Romans and Augustus,’ oh Caesar, you who spring from the noblest blood of the Greeks, who triumph in power over the Greeks, you who command the Romans by lawful inheritance and surpass both in spirit and eloquence

So there _was_  a Caesar in Rome, one who cared a great deal about Imperial prestige and heritage.

The real problem was those pesky Romans. They were used to having a lot of independence — like Crescentius, the other barons of central Italy weren’t actually very happy to have an emperor in their midst; they preferred it when the emperors were off fighting in Central Europe and the local Roman potentates could run things close to home. They particularly didn’t appreciate Otto’s support for Pope Sylvester, an enthusiastic reformer who didn’t like the local barons treating the Church as their private piggy-banks. It didn’t help that Sylvester was French, not Italian.

So, in 1001 the Roman nobility chased the emperor and the pope out of the city.

Otto returned in 1001 to bring the city back to heel. However the luckless emperor — only 21 — died of a sudden fever. Dying so young Otto left no heir and the empire fell into disarray. Italy would be more-or-less independent for most of the next few decades as Otto’s successor campaigned north of the alps. But for most of the next 350 years was just as Otto had known it: a fractious backwater that grudgingly accepted the authority of the empire and cared mostly about being left alone.

So to answer the question: Two different guys were trying to renew the Roman empire around the year 1000 with different stresses on “Roman” and “Empire”. One was a Roman who cared very little for the world more than a few days riding from Rome; one was a Greek-German emperor who had a hard time getting Rome to listen to him. The different ways they both failed reflect the realities of the time: an intensely localized, very fractured Europe where local loyalties mattered more than any theoretical ideals.

The concept of empire remained strong (the “empire” would last in attenuated form down to 1805) but to the average person of the year1000 “Roman emperor” invoked more memories of Charlemagne than Caesar. Otto was enough of a romantic (and the pupil of a very gifted tutor in the form of Sylvester II) that he could imagine a bit farther back — though for him the Byzantine empire in Constantinople was a much more real and living example of “imperial glory” than the Rome of Augustus. Educated people knew a few things about the Rome of a thousand before, but the realities of life in feudal Europe were far more relevant. The Romans of the year 1000 had an empire — or to be more precise, _were part of_  an empire — that suited their actual ambitions and desires better than any antiquarian fantasy.

_It’s tough to read but this seal of Otto III says OTTO D[E]I GRATIA ROMANORUM IMP AUG , “Otto, by the grace of God, emperor augustus of the Romans”_
