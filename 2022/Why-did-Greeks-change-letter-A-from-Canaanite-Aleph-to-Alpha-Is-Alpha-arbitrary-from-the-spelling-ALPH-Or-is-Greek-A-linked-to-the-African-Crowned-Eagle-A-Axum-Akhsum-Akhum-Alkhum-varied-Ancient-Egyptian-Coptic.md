# Why did Greeks change letter A from Canaanite Aleph to Alpha? Is Alpha arbitrary from the spelling ALPH? Or is Greek A linked to the African Crowned Eagle A: Axum, Akhsum, Akhum, Alkhum‚Ä¶ (varied Ancient Egyptian, Coptic dialectict spellings)?

Before getting into the specifics of alpha and it‚Äôs relationship to aleph, it‚Äôs useful to survey a general issue in early Iron-age writing systems.

One of the enduring ‚Äî but somewhat _weird ‚Äî_ patterns in the transmission of alphabetic characters is their tendency to flip or rotate. Ordinarily, If I draw you a shape like this ‚ñ≤ and ask you to copy it, I‚Äôll be a little annoyed if you give me back ‚óÑ or ‚ñº. However this type of transposition is surprisingly common in the history of Iron Age scripts. Here‚Äôs one of the oldest surviving alphabetic inscriptions in Greek, the famous _[Nikandre Inscription](https://digitalexhibits.hollins.edu/items/show/61)_ _,_ quite visibly close to Phoenician.

As you can see the Alpha ‚Äî for example, the fourth character from the right in the first line ‚Äî looks more or less like a modern A. Some of the other forms are also familiar. But notice what happens in the _second_  line: it‚Äôs written from right to left, not left to right (some of the characters that visibly flip to show the reversed flow are __ê§ì, ê§Ñ__ , and __ê§ç__ ).

To a modern reader, this tends to be highly annoying ‚Äî just try to parse this:

but evidently the habit of flipping and/or rotating characters didn‚Äôt bother early Iron Age readers very much: this style of writing (known in Greek as ‚Äú[boustrophedon](https://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail_use&key=Roro)‚Äù or ‚Äúox-plowing‚Äù hung on in Greece into the Hellenistic era. Other cultures that picked up the Phoenician alphabet from Greece or directly from Phoenician used this habit as well.*

_One of the oldest surviving Latin texts, the Lapis Niger, is written boustrophedon._ 

As an adult reader, this seems pretty perverse ‚Äî but in fact, it‚Äôs quite natural. Children learning letters frequently flip them vertically and/or horizontally. Outside of reading, our brains are used to interpreting symmetrical flips of the same shape as being ‚Äúthe same thing‚Äù ‚Äî we know our friends and family equally well in left profile and right profile. Children notoriously have trouble with __d, b, p,__ and __q__  which, in their modern lower case forms, are all mirrors of one another.



This digression is useful when you‚Äôre trying to understand the derivation of several Greek letter shapes: most of them are close matches for Phoenician characters ‚Äî simply rotated in ways that might be annoying to us, who are surrounded by text, but which were less surprising in the early days of alphabetic writing. Here you can see how alpha evolved from rotations of original Proto-Sinaitic pictograph for an ox:

The Proto-Sinaitic version itself derives from the proper hieroglyph for an ox‚Äôs head:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-606de7ce153a62e31d78abef8516833f-lq)

_The hieroglyph for an ox head (_ _[Gardiner F1](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%93%83%BE)_ _) pronounced kÍú£ , somewhere between ‚Äúko‚Äù and ‚Äúka‚Äù . From the_ _[coffin of Khnumnakht, 19th century BC, c/o Digital Epigraphy.](https://www.digital-epigraphy.com/painted-hieroglyphs/coffin-of-khnumnakht-020?mode=basic)_ 

One interesting note here is that the Phoenician version (and, presumably, the Proto-Sinaitic one) take their name from the Semitic word for ox, not from the way the symbol was pronounced by Egyptians ‚Äî the original hieroglyph would have sounded something like ‚Äúko‚Äù or ‚Äúka‚Äù. [Many of the Proto-Sinaitic glyphs get their forms from Egyptian hieroglyphs but their sound values come from the Semitic names of the objects depicted.](https://www.quora.com/Did-illiterate-Canaanite-miners-really-make-the-breakthrough-from-hieroglyphs-to-an-alphabet/answer/Steve-Theodore) Here‚Äôs a table showing a few derivations of the Phoenician and Greek signs from the Proto-Sinaitic symbols by way of their Semitic names:

_The_ _[Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Sinaitic_script)_ _has a more complete list of correspondences. Some of these are debated among scholars, notably whether the origin of our ‚ÄúD‚Äù is_ __dalet__ ___,___ _a door, or_ __dag__ _, a fish. Given how much variation there is in early scripts, both may be true. Modern Hebrew uses_ __dalet__ for the letter ◊ì, so _‚Äúdoor‚Äù won out eventually._ 

Returning at last to the original question:

The Greeks borrowed the name of their letters from the Phoenicians. The names morphed a little to make them a bit easier for Greek speakers but the correspondences are quite obvious: _aleph_ becomes _alpha_ , _bayt_ becomes _beta_ , _dalet_ becomes _delta_ , and so on. The main exceptions are the letters which which the Greeks added for themselves, notably __omicron Œü__ , __omega Œ©__ , __epsilon Œï__ , and __upsilon Œ•.__ These are clearly Greek additions:_o-micron_  means ‚Äúlittle O‚Äù, _o-mega_ is ‚Äúbig O‚Äù; _e-psilon_ and _u-psilon_ mean ‚Äúsimple E‚Äù and ‚Äúsimple U‚Äù respectively.

However the Phoenician origins of the letters were not forgotten. [Antiquarians referred to them as ‚ÄúCadmeian‚Äù letters, because they were supposedly brought to Greece by the hero Cadmus, a Phoenician. ](https://www.greece-is.com/whos-greek-mythology-c-cadmus/)Here‚Äôs the philosopher Plutarch reporting an argument he overheard about why alpha was the first letter of the alphabet.**

> Ammonius, speaking to me, said: "What! have you, being a Boeotian, nothing to say for Cadmus, who (as the story goes) placed Alpha the first in order, because a cow is called Alpha by the Phoenicians, and they account it not the second or third (as Hesiod doth) but the first of their necessary things?"



You‚Äôll not here that Plutarch can‚Äôt bring himself to write _aleph_  or _alph_  even though he‚Äôs clearly aware of the origin of the letter. It was quite hard for a Greek speaker to pronounce a terminal consonant cluster ‚Äî the same habits of speech that make a Japanese person turn _ice cream_ into „Ç¢„Ç§„Çπ„ÇØ„É™„Éº„É†, _aisu kurimu_ make it hard for Plutarch to end a word (particularly, a noun) with the sound ‚Äúph‚Äù. Nevertheless he‚Äôs clearly trying to explain that the Greek alpha is the Phoenician aleph, the letter which once signified an ox.



* Boustrophedon is not only found in Phoenician derived languages; for example, it‚Äôs used in [Anatolian Hieroglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_hieroglyphs) and [Rongorongo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rongorongo)
**Plutarch, a Boeotian, is here expected to stand up for Cadmus, who founded Thebes ‚Äî the most famous city in his home province)
