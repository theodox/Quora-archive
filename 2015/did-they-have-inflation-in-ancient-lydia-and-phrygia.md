Although the Lydians invented coinage, their trade with other people would still have been primarily a commodity trade rather than a monetary one. A coin is, among other things, a (theoretical) standardized unit of weight to simplify exchanges. The Greek or Phoenician taking your Lydian coins is getting a lump of gold (or more likely, electrum) , and probably weighing it on a scale to make sure he's getting what you've promised. You'll notice that large amounts in that period are usually denominated in [Attic talents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_talent), rather than coins -- the talent being about 26 kg (57 lbs) of silver. Coins made measurement and daily trade easier but the underlying belief was that the value was weight-of-metal, not the authority of the mint. 

So, it's gold and silver are commodities -- although the Lydians invented coinage, that was mostly a convenient way of simplifying what was basically a commodity trade. A big influx of gold or silver would change the relative value, but Lydia was far from the only source. Egypt, in particular, was another big gold producer, so the Lydian sources were not the only influence on the relative value of gold across the region. 

 So, yes, large scale production of gold or silver lowered the relative value of those commodities over time, but the changes were not likely to be rapid. Difficulties of transportation (this was metal, it had to be lugged around) and production (ancient mining was difficult) put a damper on the effects. By way of analogy, we know that the influx of precious metals from the New World to Spain caused significant inflation there but that it took quite a while to develop and even longer to impact the wider European economy. The volume of metal was much lower in Lydia, and transportation was far less efficient, so the effects would take longer to manifest themselves widely. 

In the meantime, of course, the Lydians did pretty well out of their gold mines. [Croesus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croesus), for example, was the perfect example of the the tacky rich man in Greek literature.
