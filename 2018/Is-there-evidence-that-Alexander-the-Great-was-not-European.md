Well sure… for a given value of ‘evidence’

There are two rival stories which share a lot in common.

__Alexander the Egyptian__ 

The first one circulated pretty widely in medieval Europe as part of the [Alexander Romance](http://www.attalus.org/info/alexander.html), a collection of stories with a flimsy connection to Alexander’s actual career. The Romance tells us that Nectanebo, the last Egyptian Pharoah, cast a spell on Queen Olympias of Macedon to convince her that she would be visited by the god Ammon. Then he dressed himself up in a fleece and a pair of rams horns and mated with the Queen, fathering Alexander while king Phillip was away.

Alexander always went out of his way to conciliate Egyptian sentiment: his famous [visit to the oasis of Siwa](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised) was the place where he began transitioning from mortal warlord to living god, and his embrace of his “father” Zeus-Ammon is the historical basis for the embellishments of the later stories. Siwa was not just a famous Egyptian religious site — it had also been one of the strongholds of [the real Nectanebo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectanebo_II), who was driven out by the Persians when Alexander was a child. So this version reflects Alexander’s popularity among native Egyptians, who loved him for driving the hated Persians out of Egypt and avenging his “father,” the last native Pharaoh.

__Alexander the Persian__ 

A related story shows up in the [Shahnameh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh), the great 10th century Persian epic. Here a fictional Persian king [Darab ](https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/page37.htm)(roughly, the historical Darius II) defeats an emperor of Rome (!) named Failakus (that is, Phillip of Macedon). As part of the peace treaty he demands Failakus’s daughter in marriage. However, the princess Nahid turns out to have terrible bad breath and is quickly sent packing — but not before Darab has gotten her with the child who will grow to be [Sikandar ](https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/shahnameh/page38.htm)(Alexander). After studying with the great sage Aristu (Aristotle) Sikander will return and will defeat his half-brother, a second Darab, to become king of Persia and then conqueror of the world.

_Sikandar, in red, comforts his dying half-brother Darab II, in blue, after defeating him._ 

Not unlike the Egyptian version, this effort to weave Alexander into the Persian national history reflects a desire to claim the great conqueror for the home team. It’s particularly interesting in Persia because there are other strains in Persian literature — particularly in the [Denkard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denkard), the Zoroastrian religious commentaries — where Alexander is regarded as the great national enemy. Presumably the Shahnameh version reflects the final victory of Alexander’s policy of trying to reconcile Greeks and Persians.

__…etc__ 

Defeat, as they say, is an orphan but victory — like Alexander, apparently — has many fathers. Alexander’s fame also earned him connections to [Sumatran rajas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikayat_Iskandar_Zulkarnain) and the [Ethiopian Church](https://archive.org/details/cu31924091208573) as well as fictional exploits in languages from [Irish to Mongolian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_romance). I would not hazard any money on these stories being verifiable by DNA testing — but they are certainly interesting examples of the strange afterlife of the Macedonian warlord.

And, [given the standards of historical accuracy we seem to like in the 21st century](https://www.quora.com/Were-Achilles-and-Zeus-black-like-in-the-BBC-series-Troy-Fall-of-a-City/answer/Steve-Theodore), who are we to poke fun?
