No. The closest they got was their wars against the [Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt#Piye), which was ruled by ethnic Nubians from the kingdom of [Kush.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush) From about 750 to 650 BC the Nubian dynasty and the Assyrians battled for influence in Canaan, the Levant and Syria.* Eventually, in 671 BC the Assyrians fought their way into lower (ie, northern) Egypt, chasing out Pharaoh [Taharqa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taharqa) and installing a puppet Pharaoh. However they never got farther south than Thebes — certainly nowhere past the cataracts marking the boundary of Egypt and Sudan.

_Assyria at more or less maximum extent, ca. 650 BC_ 

The conquest of Egypt marked the zenith of Assyrian power — within a generation their empire was overthrown in a series of revolts. Kush gave way to a later Nubian kingdom, [Meroë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB). In turn Meroë was eventually conquered by the proto-Ethiopian kingdom of [Axum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axum). However by that time the Assyrian empire had long since disappeared.



* Much of this is recorded the Bible: the tag line “[Pharaoh is a broken reed](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm)” reflects Isaiah’s (correctly) pessimistic view of Egyptian chances against the Assyrians.
