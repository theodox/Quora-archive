# Do scholars have an idea of when the various Vetus Latina manuscripts were translated from Greek into Latin? I want to know the range of dates for when these pre-Vulgate translations were first produced?

It’s much harder to date the translations than the manuscripts. There a bunch of tools that palaeographers can use to estimate the age of a manuscript, from the physical composition of the materials to the rise and fall of different scribal styles. But the translations are harder to date. In this case you have a large number of translations which may or may not be independent; there were also at least four significant variants of the Hebrew scriptures in the Greek tradition (collected into the [Hexapla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexapla)) floating around in the mid 200’s.

The multiplicity of variants that were current in the 4th century is part of the reason Jerome was asked to do the edition which became the Vulgate. [Augustine, writing after Jerome](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/12022.htm), complains that

> Translators from Hebrew into Greek can be numbered, but Latin translators by no means. For whenever, in the first ages of the faith, a Greek manuscript came into the hands of anyone who had also a little skill in both languages, he made bold to translate it forthwith.

So, it’s tough to pin a clear date on a given reading — identifying the changes which reflect different sources , those which come from different translations, and those which are introduced by copyists is a challenge to say the least.

It is usually said that the oldest attested Latin Bible is the one which supplies the quotations for St. Cyprian, writing in the early 3rd century. Cyprian seems not to have spoken Greek, so his quotations must reflect a Latin edition of some kind before about 250 (he was martyred in 256). The [Codex Bobiensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Bobiensis) is an African manuscript from the 4th century which includes readings that Cyprian provides, so it’s probably representative of the oldest Latin tradition.

There are rival schools of thought as to whether Tertullian, an earlier African writer in Latin, was working from a Latin translation or whether he did his own translations from Greek; unlike Cyprian, he clearly knew both languages. If Tertullian was not translating on the fly, that would push the translation horizon back another generation to sometime between 200 and 225.

So, about as precise as you can get is a fuzzy range between 200–250 on the low end and maybe 400-450 on the high, assuming that the breakup of the empire slowed diffusion of texts between Greek and Latin but also that some translations were ongoing after Jerome as well. Only two or maybe three of the surviving manuscripts fall into this range; the Bobiensis, the [Codex Vercellensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Vercellensis) and the [Codex Bezae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Bezae) are all 5th century and so _might_ represent original translations, though the Bezae is assumed to go back to an earlier version around 250.
