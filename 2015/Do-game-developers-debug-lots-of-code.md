The overwhelming majority of the time spent with any code is spent debugging. Since most games involve 3rd party libraries -- physics engines, UI tools, AI navigation tools and so on -- we spend a lot of time stepping through outside code as well as our own. 

It's not all 'debugging', since quite often we're trying to figure out that the code _thinks_  it's doing -- the documentation is often pretty sparse -- but we spend a lot of time poking around at code from outside the studio and inside the studio trying to see how the (often very surprising) behaviors we see in a the game came about. Since most games involve code written by dozens of people over several years, nobody really understands it all: debugging and experimentation are the only way to get exact, detailed knowledge of what's going on. And that's when things are _working!_ When things are broken it's worse.
