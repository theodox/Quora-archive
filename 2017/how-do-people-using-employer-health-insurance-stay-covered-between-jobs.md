In the States, usually via COBRA or “continuation health care coverage”

Unless you’re fired for “gross misconduct” — which is kinda vague — you probably have COBRA. The main exception is companies under 20 people.

As of right now, you usually become eligible to enroll on the [Healthcare.gov Marketplace ](http://healthcare.gov/)if you lose your employer plan. What that will look like in a year is anybody’s guess
