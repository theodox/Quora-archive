As others have pointed out, there are a lot of good options so you probably want to narrow your options with a few questions first.

__1) what kind of programming experience?__ 

If you don't consider yourself a semi-pro coder or more, you might want to start with game kits like [Multimedia Fusion 2](http://www.clickteam.com/multimedia-fusion-2) or [GameSalad ](http://gamesalad.com/creator) or even [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) so you can play around with design ideas, understand what's easy and hard in creating game experiences, and see results fast. 

On the other hand, if you're already comfortable with programming you can pick up something like [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), which is a good entry level platform but can also make very polished products. Most Unity devs use C# these days, which is a fairly easy language to pick up if you know Java or have done a lot of OOP in other languages. Unity also has the advantage of a huge userbase and many books and online sources. There are other good, free or cheap engines out there but none has the huge ancillary support that Unity does.

__2) What kind of game?__ 

If you're doing this solo or as a hobby project, choose a project that small enough to be achievable or you can get bogged down. Unity, for example, can do beautiful 3d rendering and animations; but making beautiful, fluid content is a whole skillset of its own and piling it on top of learning game design, release management, and coping with unexpected player behavior is a big undertaking. It'd be ideal to finish three, for our five little projects to get used to the differences between game programming and 'regular' coding before taking on something with high production values.

If you're part of a team, on the other hand, and your team includes artists or designers to handle the specialty work... well, Unity is a good choice here because it provides off the shelf access to industry standard model, image and audio files; the game kits generally do so as well.

__3) What are you trying to learn?__ 

If you're interested primarily in the technology of games, rather than in making stuff, there are good open-source engines for pretty much every language, from [OGRE](http://www.ogre3d.org/) to [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html) to [Azul](https://azul3d.org/). These will be much more involved programming tasks and demand a lot more work on your part, but if you want to see how things 'really work' and have the drive they will let you get right down to the bottom of things. If you're thinking about a game career, C++ remains the race-car of choice (fast, powerful, dangerous and user-unfriendly). 

You'll notice I did not mention Unreal, which is a great engine but it's highly optimized for one particular way of making games so I would not recommend it for a first-timer: you'd emerge from your first project with a lot of skills that are very Unreal specific.

You should also find out if there is a game school, [IGDA](http://www.igda.org/) chapter, or indie games meetup in your area where you can meet other people who want to get involved: nothing beats sharing information with real people when it comes to learning.
