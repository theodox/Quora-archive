In addition to the excellent answers here I would also study up Dan Cook's great Gamasutra article, _[Minimum Sustainable Success](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DanielCook/20150415/241145/Minimum_Sustainable_Success.php)_ _,_ which sums up many of the issues in a very candid and matter of fact way.
