I was taught taught the Erasmian pronunciation in class, but in practice I and most of my fellow students slipped in bits of our regional English accents as well — it ends up sounding like a Graecized version of the generic academic neutra-speak that comes from lots of people of different regional backgrounds competing to sound erudite.

The handful of teachers I had who really devoted themselves to the spoken word - [Emily Vermeule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Vermeule) comes to mind - laid much more stress on the music and vowel quantities of the language than those of us who were just struggling with the grammar. I was dealing with the language primarily as a primary-source language, rather than approaching it with the sensibilities and needs of, say, a drama critic, so I didn’t really put in the effort necessary to get the voices in my head and to really hear the metrical basis of the poesy. My tendency to ignore accents and aspiration marks also played hell with my grades.

FWIW the Greek I heard in class — and in my head — sounds very little like the Greek I heard from my extended family. My Grandparents and their generation spoke a much more tonally varied language than what I got in class.
