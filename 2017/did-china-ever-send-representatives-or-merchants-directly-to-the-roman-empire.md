Yes.

There’s a vague, handwavey mention of “representatives of the Seres” — who would be northern Chinese — coming to offer respects to emperor Augustus, though the only mention of this comes from after 100 AD, a century or so after the fact.

On the other hand Chinese merchants did visit and trade with the Roman empire with some frequency, primarily taking the sea route from the Bay of Bengal around to the Indian Ocean and thence to Egypt. The land route passed through the Parthian and later the Sassanid empire, both of which were keen to preserve their very lucrative monopoly on the Silk Road trade — one Chinese source from around the year 97 records how the Parthians discouraged a would-be Chinese mission from reaching the west by exaggerating the difficulties of the journey. However the [bustling Indian Ocean trade ](https://www.quora.com/I-have-heard-that-ancient-Greece-and-Rome-were-having-trades-with-south-Indian-kingdoms-But-in-history-why-werent-these-given-much-importance-and-not-talked-about/answer/Steve-Theodore)made it comparatively easy for Chinese merchants to reach the Roman east, which they knew as [Daqin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daqin).

There are several surviving Chinese accounts of the markets and customs that they saw there, including a mix of sharp observations and surprising oversights — most notably, some sources describeAntioch (“An-tu”) as the capital of the empire and not merely an important provincial city.

The Chinese accounts are pretty much limited to Egypt, Arabia and Syria — the commercial opportunities there (and the difficulties of conveying cargo further, which would require trans-shipping overland) were sufficiently attractive that there’s no record of visits to Rome or Greece although they knew Alexandria (“Ali-San”) and most of the other major cities of the Roman east. Here’s a more or less comprehensible itinerary from the Red Sea to the Nile, then Alexandria, and on to Roman Syria:

> At the city of Ali-san, you travel by river on board ship one day, then make a round at sea, and after six days' passage on the great sea , arrive in this country. There are in the country in all over four hundred smaller cities; its size is several thousand li in all directions of the compass. The residence of their king lies on the banks of a river estuary [Antioch]. They use stone in making city walls. …. There are many jugglers who can issue fire from their mouths, bind and release themselves, and dance on twenty balls. In this country they have no permanent rulers, but when an extraordinary calamity visits the country, they elect as king a worthier man, while discharging the old king, who does not even dare to feel angry at this decision. The people are tall, and upright in their dealings, like the Han, but wear foreign dress; they call their country another "Middle Kingdom"

Chinese commercial contact continued into the Byzantine era, although the Islamic conquest of Egypt cut off the sea-route. At that point they knew the Romans as Fulin and noted that its capital was now in what we call Constantinople.

The Chinese sources are collected in [China and the Roman Orient](https://archive.org/stream/chinaandromanor01hirtgoog#page/n246/mode/2up), which is still widely used although a few of the author’s identifications of Roman places have been challenged.
