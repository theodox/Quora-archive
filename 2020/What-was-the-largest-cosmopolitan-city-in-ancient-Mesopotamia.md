For most of the ancient era it was Babylon, which was probably the largest city in the world for most of the thousand years between 1300 and 300 BC.

Under the Seleucid and later the Parthian empires, Babylon entered a slow decline. By around 200 BC or so it was surpassed by the twin cities of [Seleucia-Ctesiphon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucia). When Roman troops reached Babylon in the year 117, it was mostly a deserted ruin.
