Apparently so, though the story may be a little too neat for complete confidence.

There’s no contemporary account, but at least by the time of Plutarch (late 1st / early 2d century) it was believed that they met. Plutarch wrote ([Alexander, 62](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243%3Achapter%3D62))

> Androcottus, when he was a stripling, saw Alexander himself, and we are told that he often said in later times that Alexander narrowly missed making himself master of the country, since its king was hated and despised on account of his baseness and low birth.

“Androcottus” is scribal mistake for “Sandrocottus”, which was the Greek effort at writing “Chandragupta’. He’s described here as ‘a stripling’ — this might reflect the tradition in Indian sources that had him as a student in Taxila, which was part of the Macedonian possessions in India.

A [Latin source](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/justinus_04_books11to20.htm) from about a century later says this:

> [Sandrocottus] was of mean origin, but was stimulated to aspire to regal power by supernatural encouragement; for, having offended Alexander by his boldness of speech, and orders being given to kill him, he saved himself by swiftness of foot; and while he was lying asleep, after his fatigue, a lion of great size having come up to him, licked off with his tongue the sweat that was running from him, and after gently waking him, left him. Being first prompted by this prodigy to conceive hopes of royal dignity, he drew together a band of robbers, and solicited the Indians to support his new sovereignty.

The fairy-tale element of the story render it bit suspicious — but it definitely shows that the tradition of a meeting was widely held in antiquity.
