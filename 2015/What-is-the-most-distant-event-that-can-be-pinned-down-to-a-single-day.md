If you're looking for historical events, there's [the Battle of Megiddo](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/megiddobattle.htm), fought between Pharoah Tuthmosis III and a collection of Canaanites on April 16, 1457 BC . Accurate to the day dates are extremely rare this far back in history, this one is unusual both because we have a day-date instead of a something vague like 'in the 22d year of Pharoah's reign' and also because the record is unusually precise about things like casualty counts and numbers engaged -- quite contrary to the usual Egyptian habit of bombast. 

Day-date accurate events are very hard to come by before around the 3d century BC, and even then they are not always reliable. Every culture - or more often, every city-state -- had it's own calendar and most of them were constantly being adjusted (the Roman calendar for example, had gotten several months out of tune with the seasons before the [the calendar reforrms of Julius Caesar](http://www.livius.org/caa-can/caesar/caesar_t17.html). ) For a good look at how messy all of this is, EJ Bickerman's [Chronology of the Ancient World](http://www.amazon.com/Chronology-Ancient-World-E-Bickerman/dp/0500400059) give s a pretty good roundup.
