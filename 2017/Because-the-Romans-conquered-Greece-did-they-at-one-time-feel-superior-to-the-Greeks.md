Oh yeah. The Romans were pretty inclusive by ancient standards — but they were also pretty ethnocentric. Even though they were quite self conscious about their debt to Greek civilization they also tended to look down on the Greeks as being unmanly, dishonest, and undisciplined. A stereotyped contrast between sturdy, honest, simple Romans and slippery Greeks who were too clever for their own good was a staple of Roman thinking before and after the conquest. Even somebody like Cicero (who studied in Athens and devoted much of his life to adapting Greek philosophy for a Roman audience) didn’t hesitate to indulge in [such generalizations](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-cultural-stereotypes-from-the-various-provinces-of-the-Roman-Empire). There were of course plenty of individual exceptions but the general tendency was to think that Greeks were just a bit too smart to be trusted.

The Greeks, of course, repaid the favor — regarding the Romans as “barbarians” who succeeded only by aping Greek culture. Again there were exceptions, like Polybius and Plutarch, but in general Greeks regarded Romans as in desperate need of some Greek culture.

Over the first two centuries of the empire Roman triumphalism faded as Greek-influenced tastes and fashions spread further and further in the Latin speaking half of the empire. Non-Romans from all over the empire eventually created a new, hybrid “Roman” identity with only very loose ties to Rome’s Italian roots (although there were still plenty of regional differences to fight over). With the loss of most of the western territories after 476 the remaining Romans became more and more Greek in culture and habits, even though they remained “Romans” in their own mind: the last emperor who spoke Latin as his native language was Justinian (482–565).
