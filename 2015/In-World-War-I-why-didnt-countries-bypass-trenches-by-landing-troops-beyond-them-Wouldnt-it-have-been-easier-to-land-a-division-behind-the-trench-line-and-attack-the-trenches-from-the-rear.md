# In World War I, why didn't countries bypass trenches by landing troops beyond them? Wouldn't it have been easier to land a division behind the trench line and attack the trenches from the rear?

The British did cobble together a plan, the http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Project, to land troops directly on Germany's exposed northern coasts. They even went as far as designing and building a set of special shallow-draught capital ships to support the operation.

However to make the plan work German naval power would have to be neutralized -- but the Royal Navy was never able to eliminate the threat of the German high Seas Fleet, whose main bases lay between Britain and the planned invasion areas. The two navies fought to a bloody draw in 1916 and the Germans adopted a defensive posture that kept their smaller but still powerful fleet intact for the rest of the war. Any attempt to sail tens or hundreds of thousands of troops right past the stronghold of the German navy on their way to the Baltic would have been an unsustainable risk.
