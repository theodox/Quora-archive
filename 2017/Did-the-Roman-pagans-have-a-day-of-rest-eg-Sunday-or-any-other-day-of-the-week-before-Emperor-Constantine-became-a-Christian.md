No. In fact Jewish sabbath observance was something that kind of scandalized a certain kind of Roman observer. Here’s [Juvenal ](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/juvenal_satires_14.htm)— granted, not one of your more open minded Romans — complaining about young Romans who adopted the Jewish custom:

> Some who have had a father who reveres the Sabbath, worship nothing but the clouds, and the divinity of the heavens, and see no difference between eating swine's flesh, from which their father abstained, and that of man; and in time they take to circumcision. Having been wont to flout the laws of Rome, they learn and practise and revere the Jewish law, and all that Moses committed to his secret tome, forbidding to point out the way to any not worshiping the same rites, and conducting none but the circumcised to the desired fountain. For all which the father was to blame, who gave up every seventh day to idleness, keeping it apart from all the concerns of life.

That’s not to say the Romans never got days off; the Roman calendar was festooned with various holidays on which business of various kinds was supposed to be suspended. This is a fragment of a Roman calendar

you’ll notice the large that some of the entries have ___FER___ ____ written next to them; those are religious festivals which involved a partial suspension of regular life and some opportunities for relaxation. However plenty of Romans would still be working on those days. The _feriae_ were public festivities with processions or games or sacrifices; there was no Roman equivalent to the Sabbath injunction to study or attend regular worship.

There was also a dizzyingly complex set of rules governing government business (the large “N”s in the calendar above are days when the courts were closed) but that was primarily a public rather than a private matter; as far as we know there was no expectation that businesses would close on those days.
