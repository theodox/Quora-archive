Well, on the battlefield they wouldn’t stand a chance.

At their second-century peak, Rome’s legions mustered about 450,000.* By contrast the German army which invaded France in 1940 numbered about 3.5 million — and over the course of the war the Russian army mobilized 35 million — more than 70 times as many men as Rome ever saw under arms. Even the formidable discipline and tenacity of the Romans would not be beat those kinds of odds, even without two millennia of military technology tipping the scales even further.

One interesting sidelight, however — if the Romans had suddenly reappeared it might have forced Italy to reappraise the claims of Fascism. The aura of Roman prestige — and the festering inferiority complex that came with it — were very central to the Fascist mystique in Italy and to sympathizers across Europe.

Confronting the messy reality of real live Romans would have thrown a tremendous monkey-wrench into the Fascist image-making machinery — the idealized cardboard cutouts that were supposed to motivate Italians to serve the fatherland and the fasces were much easier to manage than some hundreds of thousands (or millions!) of disoriented pagan Latin-speakers confronted by the madness of the 20th century. It’s hard to predict but it does not seem like a situation that your average Fascist PR hack would envy. It would be kind of like what happens when a modern celebrity gets a twitter account: reality has a way of outstripping editorial control and the results are usually humiliating.

_Of course if this is your idea of stirring wartime propaganda, what do you have to lose?_ 

_* technically only 30–40% of these were ‘legions’, the rest were a variety of auxiliaries from all over (and sometimes from outside) the empire._
