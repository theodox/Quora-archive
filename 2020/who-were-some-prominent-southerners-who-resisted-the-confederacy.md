[David Farragut,](https://www.nps.gov/articles/david-farragut.htm) the first man ever to reach the rank of Admiral in the US Navy, was born a Tennessean and he lived in Virginia on the eve of the war.

To be fair, though, his real home was the sea — he is one of the tiny handful of men to serve in both the Civil War _and_  the War of 1812 — as a twelve year old midshipman he served on the USS Essex in the Pacific and at thirteen he was a POW, captured in a battle off of Valparaiso, Chile.

When the war broke out Farragut and his wife — the aptly named Virginia Loyall — lived in Norfolk, Virginia. When the state voted to secede Farragut didn’t hesitate about his own loyalties but he offered his wife, a southern belle, the opportunity to return to her parents. She decided to stick with him and the Union: the Farraguts and their 16 year old son escaped to Baltimore by ship.

As a southerner in a service dominated by New Englanders, Farragut was treated with suspicion by many of his service colleagues; despite nearly fifty years of naval experience he wasn’t offered a command until 1862. However his value to the war effort quickly became obvious — four months after hoisting his flag he led the squadron which captured [captured New Orleans,](https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/heritage/usn-lessons-learned/farragut-new-orleans.html) the largest city in the Confederacy. That fall, his gunboats helped drive off a Confederate effort to recapture Baton Rouge.

The capstone of his career was the capture of the heavily defended [Mobile Bay](https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/2015/09/25/admiral-david-farragut-and-the-battle-of-mobile-bay/) in 1864, closing the last major port in the South. The 63 year old admiral directed the battle from high in the rigging of his flagship, USS Hartford, in order to keep a vantage point above the cannon smoke. His nervous officers had him lashed into the rigging, fearing a fatal fall to the deck below. Farragut famously chose to run his fleet directly through a known Confederate minefield in order to force the a decisive action: this is the origin of the [slightly inaccurate but evergreen quote](https://www.usni.org/magazines/naval-history-magazine/2014/july/damn-torpedoes), “Damn the torpedoes — full speed ahead!”*

Mobile was also a kind of metaphor: the most powerful southern ship in the defending fleet was the ironclad CSS Tennessee, which was captured in the first day of the battle and then returned into service as the USS Tennessee a week later, under the orders of the Tennessean admiral who had commanded the fleet. His opponent at Mobile Bay, [Franklin Buchanan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Buchanan), was Farragut’s mirror image as well: a seasoned officer of the old US Navy from Baltimore who resigned his commission in 1861 even though his home state did not secede. His resolve was almost a match for Farragut’s too: under his command the Tennessee fought alone against the entire Union fleet for nearly three hours before being battered into submission.

As reward for his wartime service Farragut was the first US Naval officer promoted to the rank of Admiral — before the civil war the highest rank in the US Navy was Commodore. He remained the senior officer in the Navy until his death in 1870.

* ”Torpedos” in 1864 were stationary electrically operated mines; they wouldn’t get their modern form for another generation. The actual, slightly less inspiring sound bite was “Damn the torpedoes! Jouett, full speed! Four bells, Captain Drayton!”
