# American science education has started to focus more on "how science is done" rather than just the facts. Should this approach also be applied to history?

I’d say a procedural approach to historiography has been the norm in higher education for at least a generation. It was certainly how I was taught in the 80’s and how I was trained to teach as a grad student. I see basically the same strategy being used to teach high schoolers today. The drill-and-kill, names-and-dates school has been out of fashion for a long time, at least in the US.

In most ways, that’s a good thing. But, that said, I actually feel like the pendulum may have swung rather too far. If I were a science educator, I’d be cautious about embracing the procedural paradigm too wholeheartedly.

I spend a good deal of time with my kids on their homework, and in general they “get it”: from the basics of, say, how atomic valences work to the way you do long division, the _conceptual_ component of what they are learning is not usually the sticking point. Sometimes it takes some discussion, some back and forth, or even just a good youtube explainer video — but for high school and most college work it seems like the concepts are not the problem.

Actually applying them, on the other hand, is where things fall apart — whether it’s sloppy math, or skipping steps in a series of operations, or just forgetting some critical variable the actual difference between successfully using those concepts and not seems to have a lot more to do with the grim, old-fashioned work of practice and repetition than I like to admit. As anything but a natural mathematician I’ve had to concede that my _conceptual_  grasp of things usually gets me about 25% of the way to an answer: the rest has to be work.

In history, there’s an analog in the form of those boring old _facts_ .

Interpreting facts is the craft of history — but you can’t interpret data you have not assimilated. If you don’t know the physical and temporal landscape of your subject, if you don’t recognize the major players, if you can’t supply context that’s not included in your assignment packets… well, being able to talk about the factors that influence interpreting a primary text or the need to account for source bias isn’t going to cut it. Memorizing kings and battles is silly (although, I must admit, I still have the Roman emperors through Septimius Severus by heart, thanks to my grad school orals) . I shudder to recall one kid I taught at Brown, who was full of confidence as he spun his theories about how the 19th century evolved before pausing to ask, “by the way, who was that Napoleon guy again? He was what, Italian?”

Let’s just say it did not end well.

History isn’t (or at least, it should not be) just memorization; but it’s also not just process. Like math or physics or chemistry, it’s the application of a set of disciplines to complex subject matter. And, like them, without a reasonable control of the subject matter it’s impossible. You can’t be a historian without a good grasp of data any more than you can be a good physicist by “understanding” relativity without being able to actually run any numbers. Google certainly lessens the burden of pure memorization, for which we should all be grateful — but you cannot google that which you do not know exists.

How’s that for a long winded way of saying “sorta”?
