I’d hesitate to use “race” for this.

The original settlers of Carthage were Phoenicians, they came from the Mediterranean coast of what’s now Lebanon and Syria.

In ancient tradition, the Phoenicians migrated to the area from “the Red Sea”at some point in the distant past — but the one written account is confusing because the author sometimes uses “Red Sea” the way we do and sometimes uses it to mean what we’d call the Persian Gulf. Since Phoenician was a [Northwest Semitic language,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Semitic_languages) closely related to Hebrew, it’s more likely that the Red Sea in question is ours. In any case they would resemble modern Lebanese, Syrians, Palestinians and Sephardi Jews: modern genetic studies use [haplogroup J2](http://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_J2_Y-DNA.shtml) as a proxy for this rough grouping. It shows a noticeable concentration in the eastern Mediterranean, but there are also strong traces in coastal North Africa where the old Carthaginian empire was centered.

Over time the Carthaginians intermarried with their neighbors, first the [Libyans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Libya) to their east and later with the [Numidians](https://www.quora.com/What-race-were-the-Numidian-auxiliaries-that-were-used-by-the-Ancient-Roman-Empire) to their west. Both of those peoples were related to the modern Berber peoples of North Africa. Hannibal’s sister, for example, married a Numidian king, and the tragic romance of the Numidian king [Masinissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masinissa) and the Carthaginian noblewoman [Sophonisba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophonisba) was a popular subject for operas and plays until the 18th century.

This is believed to be the only surviving contemporary portrait of Hannibal. Many coins from this period show a similar looking man, it’s not clear if those are portraits of Hannibal and his father or if they are idealized portraits of the Phoenician god Melqart.

A typical example of Barcid coin which might or might be a member of Hannibal’s family.
