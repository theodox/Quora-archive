It appears to be a [12th century Greek manuscript in the national library of Vienna](https://search.onb.ac.at/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ONB_alma21307137150003338&context=L&vid=ONB&lang=de_DE&search_scope=ONB_gesamtbestand&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,arrian&sortby=rank&facet=rtype,include,Handschrift&mode=basic&offset=0).
