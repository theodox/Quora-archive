The Achaemenid empire is __a__  Persian empire but not __the__  Persian empire — it was the first but not the last.

It’s hard to give an accurate count, since you could argue definitions all day — but there are quite a few: with standouts like the [Parthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire), the [Sassanids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire), the [Safavids ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_dynasty)along with the many [Persianate empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persianate_society) of central and south Asia.
