Grammatically it might be slightly more complex: languages often simplify their structure over time so Latin has features (like special treatment for ablative and dative clauses) that English lacks today. However in terms of vocabulary English is far richer and draws from so many diverse sources that Latin seems hopelessly parochial by comparison.
