There’s no evidence for a two-trident style. Actually our evidence is pretty limited over all — we have pictures and a few literary references but none are really technical in nature. Most of what we believe about Roman fighting styles is based on modern reconstructions rather than original data.

The classic trident fighter is called a [Retiarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retiarius), and the usual equipment was a trident, a weighted net, and a dagger. _Retiarii_ wore little or no armor, relying on speed and agility for protection. They formed one of the lowest classes of gladiator in the popular imagination since their fighting style was less macho than that of other gladiators; there’s some evidence to suggest that _retiarii_ trained on other weapons to move up the ranks during their careers.

As you can see in the image, the net was an important counterpart to the trident. By entangling the better armored opponent, the retiarus can make even better use of his superior mobility.

But - as you can see from the image - effective use of a pole weapon really needs two hands. It would be very easy for an enemy to bat aside a trident (or a spear, or any other pole weapon) because it would be pitting the full momentum of his sword or shield arm against only the strength of your wrist. Styles that emphasize single-handed pole weapons tend to emphasize shorter shafts (like a Zule _iklwa)_ to minimize that disadvantage — or use the spears for throwing rather than ‘fencing’. For retiarus — with no shield, armor, or backup weapon besides a dagger — throwing the trident would be a tactic of last resort.

Here, incidentally is the image above in context: the net, apparently, wasn’t enough to stop that _[murmillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murmillo)_ _:_

Of course, if you like the concept you can always [try it out for yourself…](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/rome-gladiator-school)
