While this is not something I'm an expert in there appears to be some discussion of exactly this question here: [Roman Shields](https://books.google.com/books?id=--EOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA106&lpg=PA106&dq=roman+bow+draw+weight&source=bl&ots=t4z811CZJc&sig=yv0i0fp_roWX56BRHJqPSkYFEZQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjX17eaprLKAhVD8GMKHVT9BXIQ6AEIgAEwFQ#v=onepage&q=roman%20bow%20draw%20weight&f=false) .

The gist of it seems to be that a lightweight recurve bow with a draw of about 70 lbs would penetrate a Roman scutum easily at 30 feet and fairly well at 60 feet. An English war bow may have had a draw weight of up to 150 lbs (though that's disputed) so the authors suggest that the penetration range would would be about double that for the kinds of bows the Romans typically faced.

Clearly the Romans were not invincible against archery: the results at [Carrhae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carrhae) clearly show that archery could break a Roman force when tactical conditions were right. A lot would depend on the battlefield conditions and the ability of the archers to retreat: in a situation like Agincourt, marching up a muddy hill directly into a storm of arrows fired from above, the Romans would have a hard day of it (as did the French men-at-arms at Agincourt, who were were better armored than their Roman counterparts but probably less cohesive in their tactics).

If the longbowmen were smart - alternating high and low fire to keep the testudos from forming properly, and also giving ground to stay in that 50-foot radius where they could seriously threaten even shielded enemies, the Romans would have a very hard day. On the other hand if the English ran out of room to keep their distance and were brought to bay they'd have a hard time facing the Romans at close quarters.

It's also unlikely that Republican or early-Imperial cavalry could have outfought a flanking reserve of fully armed 15th century knights, although they may have been able to outmaneouver them and get at the archers from flanks or sides. Late Roman cataphracts or clibanarii might have had a somewhat more even time though even there they had several centuries of metallurgical disadvantage.
