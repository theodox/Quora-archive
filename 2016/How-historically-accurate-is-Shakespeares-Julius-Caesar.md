It follows the events [as laid out by Plutarch](http://www.shakespeare-online.com/essays/fromhistorytostage.html), who was born about a century after Caesar’s death.

Plutarch provided biographies of both [Caesar](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html) and [Brutus.](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Brutus*.html) He had access to a number of sources we don’t have, including some of Brutus’ letters and contemporary histories. However his primary concern wasn’t really strict journalistic accuracy. He was an moralist at heart and the book from which Shakespeare borrowed, the _Parallel Lives_ , is a set of character studies in which a famous Greek and a famous Roman are paired up and contrasted as exemplars of a certain type of character. Caesar was compared with Alexander as examples of ‘magnanimity’: star-power, ambition and greatness of spirit. Brutus was the personification of tragic devotion to duty — he was contrasted to [Dion of Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_of_Syracuse), another example of a nobly-minded slayer of a tyrant undone by his own goodness. Plutarch also wrote a biography of Mark Antony that Shakespeare used as the foundation for _Antony and Cleopatra,_ where Antony’s strange double-life as bold soldier and slave to passion are laid out clearly.

So, Shakespeare was relying on a good quality ancient source who had access to materials we don’t have. His source, however, is literary and philosophical first and only as historical as it needs to be.
