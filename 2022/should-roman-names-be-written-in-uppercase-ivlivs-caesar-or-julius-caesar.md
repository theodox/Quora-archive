Modern lower case letters are a late invention (usually, dated to 8th century) so you won’t find examples in original Latin inscriptions. On the other hand, the modern lower case letters derived from a late-Roman script known as [half-uncial](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/ancientbooks/2016/05/25/uncial-half-uncial/), which emerged around the 5th century and outlasted the Roman empire in the west.

While Caesar probably only ever wrote his own name as __IULIUS CAESAR__ ,* a later figure like [Sidonius Apollinaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidonius_Apollinaris) would certainly recognize himself as __sidonius appolinaris__ as well as __SIDONIUS APPOLINARIS__  (though, as a nostalgic type, he would probably prefer the latter).

The habit of mixing what we call capital and lowercase letters is later still — it evolved out of monastic copying practice but didn’t really become common until printing took off in the 15th century. So neither Caesar nor Sidonius would expect a mix of capital and lowercase letters.

Of course neither of them would immediately recognize the common Quora sans-serif font right away either. Caesar’s handwriting probably looked something like this:

And Sidonius’s was most likely like this:

__TLDR:__ It’s easiest to use modern capitalization rules — lower case letters are easier to read, capitals highlight proper nouns, and nothing we do would really match the ancient originals very closely in any case.



* the U-V swap has more to do with ease of carving than different letters: Latin did not have two different characters, but rounded U and angular V were both acceptable. Generally there was no “J”, only “I” — however in the early imperial period J became a way to write the long I vowel sound. As that sound eroded in the later empire, it was repurposed for I in the initial position of a letter.
