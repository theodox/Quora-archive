As a student project: yes. It will be tight however: the real problems are probably going to be ramp up time on whatever engine and art tools you use. 

There's no magic about it, especially with good modern tools like Unity you have everything you need: the really hard problems (3d rendering, audio, physics) are already done for you and you can concentrate on the things that make the game unique. But a semester of half-time isn't a lot of time to learn how things work and where they are to be found, even in a well documented engine: the logic isn't too overwhelming but the details of the API will demand fast study and good retention. 

[Unity](https://unity3d.com/) is probably the best choice for a project of this scope mostly because it has an order of magnitude more online documentation and tutorials than competing engines. I'd also have some serious discussions about the Unity Asset Store: if you have any money to spend, use it to purchase non-essential stuff (whatever 'non-essential' means for your team and project) so you can focus on the core of your game -- from the description it sounds like that will be the character modeling and animation side. You can supplement your art with content from [Turbosquid](http://www.turbosquid.com/), [TF3dM](http://tf3dm.com/), and [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) as well as the asset store.
