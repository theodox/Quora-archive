It’d have been hard on three counts.

First, the Greek of Alexander’s day did not yet have a word for “emperor.” The closest analog would be the way they describe the leaders of the Persian Empire, __βασιλεύς μέγας,__ _Basileus Megas,_ “Great King.” Alexander did use that but it’s not really obvious from context that basileus megas was some sort of technical term with a precise meaning; it’s more likely that it was essentially a kind of formalized nickname intended to distinguish “the” king from “a” king. Eventually Greek did get words that was more or less dedicated to the idea of a supreme ruler standing above other rules: αὐτοκράτωρ, _autocrator,_ our “autocrat” was the standard Greek translation of the Roman 	_imperator,_ the origin of our “emperor” — but that didn’t happen until Roman titles became important in the Greek world, two or three centuries after Alexander.

Secondly, nobody in the Greek world seems to have thought about applying numbers to reigning kings — [the habit seems to have originated in the Roman church during the Middle Ages](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-no-Roman-emperors-before-Constantine-called-the-Great/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=281532773&share=009f0eee&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer), when the gradual accumulation of Popes with the same names caused bureaucratic confusion. If it had been necessary to refer to some previous king Alexander people would have used some circumlocution or a nickname, perhaps “Alexander the Philhellene” for the king we’d call [Alexander I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Macedon) and — if there were need to refer to him at all, “Alexander the brother of Philip” for the short-lived [Alexander II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Macedon).

It is certainly true that Alexander invested quite heavily in public proclamations of his own glory and legitimacy; the most famous example was his enormous and expensive celebration of [mass wedding between Macedonian officers and Persian women](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/arrian/anabasis/the-weddings-in-susa/). This was clearly an attempt at legitimizing himself and his close followers in the eyes of his new Persian subjects, modelled on the pageantry of the Persian court and also showing the traditional Persian attention to royal largesse as a key royal attribute. It is notable that the ceremony was celebrated “in the Persian manner.” It was also a public celebration of the end of Alexander’s wars: in addition to the weddings the festivities included official honors for various heroes of the campaign. This was definitely intended as a formal inauguration of the new regime.

However this also brings us to the third issue for the question: The weddings took place in Susa in 324 BC and Alexander met Roxana in 327. During the Susa weddings Alexander married [Barsine](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/statira-barsine/), the daughter of Darius III — another quite obvious gesture in the direction of Persian legitimacy, and one that Roxana accepted. In [the chaos that followed Alexander’s death](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-the-descendants-of-Alexander-the-Great/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=71016357&share=01040a68&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer) the next year, Roxana had Barsine murdered.
