That’s a “both/and” rather than an “either/or” question. He was a Carthaginian but like most of the Carthaginian elite he was ultimately descended from the Phoenician colonists who built Carthage. His given name was ‬ , ḤNBʻL in Punic which — like Hebrew and Arabic — did not record vowels in written form. The ‘Ba’al’ refers to the Phoenician deity [Baal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal), “the Lord,” a title which has cognates in all Semitic languages.

There’s a good likelihood that Hannibal’s ancestors included some of the indigenous Numidian and/or Libyan population — his sister, for example, married a Numidian king during his lifetime. However we don’t have any clear records of his family prior to his father’s generation, so this is a likelihood rather than a fact; there’s a bit more on that in [this question](https://www.quora.com/Was-Hannibal-the-enemy-of-ancient-Rome-and-black/answer/Steve-Theodore?share=a4819069&srid=zLvM).
