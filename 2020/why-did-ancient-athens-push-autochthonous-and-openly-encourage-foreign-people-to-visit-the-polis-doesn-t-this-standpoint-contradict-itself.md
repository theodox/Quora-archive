# Why did Ancient Athens push autochthonous and openly encourage foreign people to visit the polis? Doesn’t this standpoint contradict itself?

The connection of the legendary ancestral king Erechtheus and “earth born” is very old, it goes back to Homer. It was enough of a piece of Athenian self-image by the mid 5th century BC that [Aristophanes has a sleazy demagogue address the rather dimwitted Demos (a standin for Athens as a whole) a “son of Erechtheus” as a piece of flattery.](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Knights.php) It’s a great parody of the sententious language of oracles

> __Demos.__ Well then, get ready to read them to me, especially the ones that talk about me. I enjoy them a lot… the bit about me becoming a great eagle in the great clouds!

> __Paphlagon.__  Sure, boss. Now listen very carefully. _Opens one of the scrolls and reads._ 

> “Mark well, Erechtheus’ son, and know the prophesies that Apollo has uttered for you from deep within his shrine and from his divine tripod. The god orders you to protect the holy, sharp-toothed dog, Cleon, who now stands and gawks before you and who protects you with his loud bark. It is he who will bring your much profit.

> And if you do not do Apollo’s bidding and protect this dog, he’ll be destroyed by the many ravens who croak endless insults against him!”

> __Demos__  holy Demeter! Now that’s one prophesy I don’t get. What’s with Erectheus and the ravens and the dog?

> __Paphlagon__ _Rolls his eyes at Demos’ idiocy_ I’m the dog, boss! Me! I’m the dog because I bark away your enemies. Phoebus Apollo is telling you to look after me, protect me!

This play will have aired at the Lenaia of 424 BC. Athenian laws about citizenship had reached their most restrictive in 451, with the passage of Pericles’ citizenship law. That law meant that you could not become an Athenian citizen unless all four of your grandparents were citizens — a standard so high that [Pericles own’ son ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles_the_Younger)did not pass the test and his father had to plead with the assembly to make one-time exception in his favor.

Autochthony was also a way of drawing a contrast between Athens and Sparta. Athens was an Ionian city, and the contrast between we’ve-always-been-here Athenians and the Dorian Spartans, whose mythical heritage was based on exile and wandering. The rise of tension with Sparta coincides with Pericles’ citizenship law and the uptick in references to autochthony in the middle of the fifth century.

It’s not a coincidence that the rhetoric about autochthony peaks right around the time that Athens was becoming more and more stingy with grants of citizen rights. During the heyday of the democracy at Athens the privileges of citizenship were real, and jealously guarded. Lawsuits trying to prove that so-and-so was or was not a “real” Athenian were very common. Even famous Athenians were often harassed with these suits.

At the same time, the prevalence of those suits is also significant in another way: clearly, there were a lot of non-citizens around. Athens was a commercial powerhouse with contacts all over the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Moreover the large Athenian population created many freedmen and women — former slaves who were tied economically to Athens even though they were not and could not become full citizens. It was a standard complaint of Athenian moralists that you could not tell slaves and [metics ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metic)from citizens: the sharp legal distinction didn’t preclude social participation. That could be good or bad (as a metic, you were liable for military service even though you could not vote) but it did mean the social boundaries were fuzzier than the legal ones.

After Alexander’s era — when Athenian politics was meaningful — the Athenians became less exclusive. By the third century BC wealthy metics were able to buy citizenship on a fairly routine basis.
