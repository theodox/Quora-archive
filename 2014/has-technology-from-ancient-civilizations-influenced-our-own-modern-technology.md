It rather depends on how you define both 'technology',

We use ideas and things invented all over the world every day: it's hard to go a day without mathematics or paper (and it's hard to finish of a day without a slice or bread and some wine!). But we typically use 'technology' in a much more restrictive sense: while it's hard to describe exactly _why,_  if you asked most people they'd say that an iPad or a plane is 'technology' but indoor plumbing or working fireplace are not, even though all four things are difficult to make and required many centuries to evolve. 

I suspect a lot of it is simply perspective: whatever you're born with you assume is 'natural', and things that crop up during your lifetime are sudden innovations. The overwhelming majority of the way we live today is part of an ongoing, gradual evolutionary process of innovations that go back over the last six thousand years, but we fixate on the shiny new stuff because it's novel. It's kind of like a coral reef that's built up slowly over millenia: the outside is colorful and very interesting but it survives on the accumulated efforts of every generation that went before. But if the end I'd choose to give up my iPad and keep bread; i'd skip my next plane trip to still have running water; delivered to my household tap; and I'd never watch TV again before I'd give up on the alphabet (perfect example: our English alphabet is derived from Latin, itself derived from Greek, which came from Phoenician, which was an adaptation of Egyptian hieroglyphs... that's how it goes...)

Maybe the most important way any technology influences the future is by providing an existence proof. People doodled about aircraft for centuries, but until the last century this could be dismissed as speculation or daydreaming. Even though nobody travels on a Wright Flyer today the existence of the first one makes all others possible (even if they use next to none of the actual engineering).
