# Do you have any idea, or understand the reason why "Unreal Engine" software should be so freaking expensive ($750,000) or CryEngine 3 at $1.2 million?

These are hugely complicated pieces of software; they operate in a far more punishing environment than pretty much any other kind of computing outside of aerospace and high-speed finance. People pay a lot for them because building the equivalent stuff on your own would be a huge, expensive and risky undertaking.

Unreal, for example is over two million lines of code. Although professionals hate to put a number on it for many reasons, the usual lazy estimate is that — after all the of planning, meetings, bug-fixing, and backtracking in a big project each programmer contributes, on average, __around 10 lines of code per day__ . That means the UE engine represents something like 200,000 programmer-days worth of work at a minimum — and that’s not counting the work of all the artists and designers and testers needed to put the engine through its paces, conceive new features, and give the programmers feedback.

Don’t forget, all that code is never “done” — if you look at the [github history for the Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github) (you’ll have to sign up to see it) you will see that there’s a steady stream of bug fixes, new features, and updates: Unreal releases several times every year and each new release involves not just programming but also testing and integration with existing code — and you can’t break the existing content either.

There’s a reason there are so few commercial game engine companies: it’s a brutally tough business, and only a big, sustained investment can keep a general purpose engine viable.

If you just want make games for yourself, you can use Unreal for free. If you want to sell your game, it’s a[ 5% royalty on gross revenue](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/custom-licensing) over $3000 per quarter. The higher figure for is for custom licenses; it’s mostly used for big projects that expect to make so much that 5% is a bad deal, or games that need special support for console platforms.
