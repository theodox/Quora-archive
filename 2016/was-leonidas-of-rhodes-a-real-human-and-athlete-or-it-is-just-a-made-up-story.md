He’s in the [list of ancient Olympic victors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_Olympic_victors) compiled by Eusebius (more famous for his biography of Constantine and his history of the early Church.) He appears in the years 164, 160 and 156 BC — way too late to be a mythological injection.

The Olympiads were the most consistent bit of date recording in the Greek world, which otherwise had a crazy mess of local calendars. The main reason Eusebius cared about them was because the Olympiads were the key to doing any kind of historical dating. So we can be pretty certain that there were good, reliable sources for most of the names and dates.
