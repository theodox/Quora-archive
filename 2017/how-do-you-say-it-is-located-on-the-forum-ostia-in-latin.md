The conversational way is _in foro Ostiae est_ , or maybe _in foro Ostiano est._ “it’s in the forum of Ostia” or “it’s in the Ostian forum.”

If you want to emphasize the settled character of something, like maybe temple or a business in the forum, _in foro Ostiae constituit,_ “it’s established in the forum of Ostia.”

If you mean “something is put in the forum of Ostia,” maybe _in foro Ostiae locatus est,_ “it was placed in the forum of Ostia.”
