Slavery in the ancient world had nothing to do with “race”. To simplify it a bit , ancient slavery was driven by _misfortune_ .

The largest single source of slaves was warfare, where the wholesale enslavement of defeated people was quite common — one of the oldest words for “slave” in Greek is _doryalōtos,_ “won by the spear”. Banditry and piracy — which were endemic until the Romans controlled the entire Mediterranean basin — usually included slave-taking. Julius Caesar, for example, was [captured by pirates in 75 BC](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/plutarch/plutarchs-caesar/caesar-and-the-pirates/); as a high-status individual he was held for ransom rather than enslaved, but it’s safe to assume that less fortunate crew and passengers on his ship ended up on the auction block. It was also possible to end up as a slave if you were convicted of a crime, or if you were unable to pay your debts.

The most pathetic source of slaves were children. Many of these were sold into slavery by their own parents — among the rural poor, the sale of a child might be the only way for a family to avoid starvation in a famine year. Abandoned infants were also frequently found and then raised as slaves; in a world without public welfare or systematic charity, the alternatives were even grimmer.

Because it was misfortune which drove slavery, a significant percentage of Greek slaves were fellow Greeks. A battlefield disaster, a bad harvest, a run-in with pirates or even a political mis-step could end on the auction block[. The philosopher Plato, for example, was briefly enslaved because he offended the ruler of Syracuse, who had him sold into slavery](https://www.quora.com/Did-Plato-s-personal-experience-of-slavery-affect-his-views-on-the-institution/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=1fe5fbb0&srid=zLvM). Like Caesar, Plato was bought out of slavery quickly — but for every case like that there are scores without a happy ending. The enslavement of otherwise privileged people might not have been an everyday occurrence, but it was common enough to become a trope in Greek literature.*

The possibility that merely being in the wrong place at the wrong time could land someone like Plato in chains raised philosophical problems for people like Aristotle, who believed slavery was a “natural” institution. Some writers (Plato included, perhaps not accidentally) suggested that Greeks ought not to enslave other Greeks. — but that unease never blossomed into anything like abolitionism. However there’s no doubt that Greek stereotypes about slavery indicate the presence of a lot of non-Greeks in the labor force. We think that an overall majority of Greek slaves were not Greeks by birth.**

The most common names for slaves in ancient Greece come from the northern and eastern borderlands of the Greek-speaking world: the Balkans (Thrace and Illyria), the Black Sea coast (Scythia), Asia Minor (Caria, Phrygia and later Galatia) and the Levant (Syria and Phoenicia).*** Thus, the “police force” of classical Athens, for example, was a slave contingent made up of Scythians from the modern Crimea, where constant reciprocal raids between different nomadic tribes produced a lot of victims. The stereotypical name for a maidservant was _Thratta,_ the female form of the ethnic designator for Thrace. A Greek orator making a joke about stereotypical slave behavior cites _Syros_ (ie, “a Syrian”) and _Manes,_  a name which is both a common personal name from Anatolia but also a Greek word meaning “dullard”. One of the easiest ways to spot a slave in Greek art is to look not for physical traits but for _pants_ , which were stereotypically associated with the Scythians, Thracians, and people from Asia Minor.

Interestingly this ended up in a Greek city in Italy — it’s unclear how the customer would have interpreted it, but it’s likely that the “Scythian archer” was known as a stereotype even to western Greeks who never met a Scythian in person.

If the question concerns African slaves in particular, they were not unknown but they were fairly rare. There are a handful of examples in art, like this one from the 4th century BC:

Compared to the many citations for slaves from the Balkans, Asia Minor and the Black Sea region, however, mentions of Africans are quite uncommon. The author [Theophrastus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastus) makes one of the few mentions of African slaves when making fun of a society fop whose luxuries included an exotic “Ethiopian” (that is, a dark-skinned African) slave to go along with his pet gazelle, his Persian tapestries, and his perfectly filed teeth.



* The musical [A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Funny_Thing_Happened_on_the_Way_to_the_Forum#Plot) based on a Roman version of a Greek comedy, concludes when the heroine (a slave) is discovered to be the long-lost daughter of a wealthy aristocrat, sold into slavery by pirates many years before.

** Our evidence, however, is not great so this is somewhat conjectural — most of what we have is really only attested for Athens, and not even very well there.

*** We don’t have good sources for Greeks in the west (in Italy and Sicily) but it’s a safe bet that the same pattern held there. In those cases the victims would have been Sicels, Italians, Gauls, Carthaginians and Libyans. It’s likely that more than a few early Romans were slaves in the Greek cities of Italy before the Romans began returning the favor, with interest, after the 3rd century BC or so.
