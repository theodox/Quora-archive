It's a long and pretty complicated story but here's the high points.

__Sparta lost its mystique.__  Sparta won the Peloponnesian war, but they won it pretty dirtily, by taking lots of Persian money. This eroded their historical image as the defenders of Greek liberty (oversold, but it was still an important aspect of their image) and did not showcase their traditional strengths as hoplite warriors so much as their ability to outlast the Athenians, who destroyed themselves with the botched attack on Syracuse and factional infighting. 

__Sparta was a lousy hegemon.__ The long, grim war also got the Spartans involved in factional politics everywhere in the Greek world: the war had an important ideological overlay, with Athens supporting democratic and popular governments and Sparta supporting oligarchies and tyrants. When the war finally ended and the Spartans were supreme in Greece, they were heavily invested in supporting a variety of unpopular regimes all over the Greek world. This undermined their traditional leadership position, since the losers and out-groups in almost every city were united in their dislike of Spartan interference. 

Unfortunately for Lacedaemon, the victorious Spartans also alienated their oligarchic friends by ham-handedly asserting themselves and by interfering with the affairs of many cities -- leaving them with few allies anywhere. Some Spartan governors and officials were simply arrogant and intrusive, like [Lysander](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Lysander*.html); some were corrupt, like [Gylippus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gylippus); and [some were both](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmost).

__Sparta lost its mojo.__  The biggest blow to Sparta, however, was the loss of their reputation as selfless, invincible warriors. Corruption and venality among Spartan representatives and governors ate away the old myth of an ascetic, almost otherworldy race who spurned wealth and luxury (the "how you gonna keep 'em down on the farm" factor was always a problem for Sparta: [Pausanias ](http://www.livius.org/person/pausanias/)had aquired a disturbing taste for gold after defeating the Persians at Plataea two generations before) . 

The far worse loss, however, was their reputation for invincibility.

_At Leuctra and Mantinea the Thebans proved that the Spartans weren't invincible_ 

A party of Theban exiles overthrew the Spartan puppet regime, and under the brilliant and innovative leadership of [Epaminondas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epaminondas) the Thebans whipped the Spartans at [Leuctra](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/337705/Battle-of-Leuctra) in 371, killing a Spartan king in the process and shattering the myth that Spartans could not be beaten in a fair fight, a fact that was underscored by a bloody Theban victory at [Mantinea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mantinea_%28362_BC%29) in 362 in the biggest hoplite battle in history. Although Epaminondas died at Mantinea and Sparta was not conquered, the Thebans freed the helots of Messenia - permanently removing a third of Sparta's territory and its subject work force and creating a strategic problem that the Spartans could never solve.

Sparta eventually rebounded from this defeat, but it was never able to regain its dominant position: in the next generation Macedon rose to dominate Greece and Sparta was relegated to the second class. Federal states like the [Achaean League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaean_League), uniting several city states, became the major players in the Greek peninsula. 

In the 240's, Sparta had a nostalgic revival under [Agis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agis_IV), a romantic who dreamed of reviving the ancient discipline and Spartan power -- but he was betrayed by oligarchic forces in the city and murdered. His idealism sparked an imitator in [Cleomenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleomenes_III), originally brought on to be a puppet of the oligarchs, but Cleomenes too failed to reignite Sparta's lost glory; he was defeated by the Achaeans and Macedonians and died in exile.

_Cleomenes III wanted to restore the ancient Spartan way -- except, apparently, for the use of iron ingots instead of coins_ 

The last gasp of the traditional Spartan way of life was the eccentric regime of [Nabis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabis) from 207 to 192; Nabis seems to have combined a run-of-the-mill military dictatorship with some classical window-dressing: he attacked private property and claimed to restore the laws of Lycurgus, but he also extinguished both of Sparta's royal houses and padded out his 'citizen' body with freed slaves and mercenaries. Nabis was defeated by the Romans in a short war in 195, but the coup-de-grace was administered by the Achaeans under [Philopoemen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philopoemen), who penned him up in the city where he was killed by erstwhile allies. Sparta was forced to join the Achaean league and was never gain independent (although Greece itself would be reduced to a Roman province in another 50 years).
