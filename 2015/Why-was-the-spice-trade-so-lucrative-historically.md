Besides issues of taste, the ancient world had very limited resources for food preservation. Spices helped disguise some of the less... attractive... aspects of living in a world without refrigeration or chemical preservatives. 

From an economic perspective, the spice trade was part of the luxury trade. Long distance bulk trade was rare in ancient times: only high value commodities justified the risk and expense of long distance trade. Plenty of local spices -- oregano, for example -- were part of various regional diets and commonly available where they were grown. Only the rare and geographically restricted ones were included in the elite world of international trade.
