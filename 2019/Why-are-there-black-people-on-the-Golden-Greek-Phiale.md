It’s most likely that that the faces on the phiale:

are connected to the popularity of images like this in Athenian art:

The style of the depiction on the phiale reflects the earlier Athenian examples, which is no big surprise: It comes from Thrace, which had extensive commercial contacts with Athens, the dominant trading power of the Black Sea and the Bosporus. Many of the luxury items we find from Thrace in this period came from Athenian workshops though it is possible that the actual work was done by Greek artisans in nearby [Seuthopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seuthopolis), which hosted a mixed Greek and Thracian population.

As for the motifs: The Athenian African-head cups are drinking vessels, which suggests that they might be connected to the cult of Dionysus. There was a lot of confusion about the origins of Dionysus (whose name means “the god of Nysa”). Nysa was supposed to be in “Aethiopia”, but where Aethiopia actually lay was a source of great confusion, since the oldest Greek writers tended to talk as if India and Africa were the same place. The confusion was never really resolved but after the age of Alexander the Great the Indian version tends to dominate — still, Dionysus’s foster-father [Silenus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silenus) is sometimes depicted with African features in later Greek and Roman art.

So, it’s a good guess that these African-themed drinking vessels are a nod to the idea that Dionysus came from the south, rather than the east. The phiale in the question is a “libation bowl” — a libation is a liquid sacrifice, usually of wine, offered in a religious ceremony. Since Dionysus is the patron god of wine the choice of African heads could be a nod to his origin story. The Thracian deity [Sabazios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabazios), who was particularly connected to the Thracian royal house, was regarded as “Dionysus” by the Greeks.

An alternative explanation lies in the acorns which decorate the inner circle of ornaments (at the bottom of the image above). Acorns are sacred to Zeus, whose oracle in the oak grove at [Dodona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodona) was influential in northern Greece and Thrace. Dodona was mythologically connected with Africa — Greeks believed that it was related to the Libyan-Egyptian oracle at [Siwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siwa_Oasis) where Alexander the Great would go to [proclaim his own divinity](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=a89a8f4c&srid=zLvM) in 332 BC. Zeus was [supposed to have a special fondness for Aethiopians](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Ancient-Greeks-refer-to-Ancient-Blacks-the-Ethiopians-as-blameless-and-favored-by-the-gods-Also-what-does-it-mean/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=3a094f97&srid=zLvM), so that might explain the decorative motif.

In any case — it’s an interesting oddball piece that shows how blurry the lines between cultures could be, even in antiquity.
