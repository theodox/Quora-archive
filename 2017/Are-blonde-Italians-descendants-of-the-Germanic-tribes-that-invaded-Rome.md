You can’t really tell, but probably not.

Italy — particularly from the vicinity of Rome northwards — has had a significant fraction of blondes for a very long time. North of the river Po the dominant population since at least the fifth century BC were Gauls, who were known for their light complexions and red or blonde hair. Ethnic Romans were not infrequently light-haired as well: among common Roman names are _Albus_  (“Whitey”), _Rufus_ (“Redhead”), _Ahenobarbus_ (“Redbeard”) and _Flavius_ (“Blondie”). Northern Italy is pretty close, genetically, to southern France and Austria; southern Italy is more similar to Greece and the rest of the Mediterranean, and the transition between the two groups is fairly gradual.*

Plenty of Germanic people did enter Italy over the centuries, a trend that started at least as early as the second century with Roman auxiliary soldiers from north and east of the border. In the middle ages, when Italy was again an economic powerhouse, it was also a popular destination for immigrants from the north who came to work in the textile industry in Tuscany. In both cases, though, the numbers were not very large compared to the pre-existing population: when the Goths invaded Italy, for example, they were fewer than 50,000 fighters and a smaller number of women: they came as an army, not as a mass migration. Those kinds of numbers do not make a big impact on a population of millions .

In any case, the running start of simply being in Italy early means that the older populations have a bigger impact on the population genetics of the current day than later arrivals. At this remove, any modern Italian probably has some ancestors who did come in one of the invasions but many more who did not, and the hair-color trait could come from either side. The hair-color map of Italy two-thousand years ago probably looked fairly close to the one in the question details.

*It’s worth distinguishing between the language and the ‘ethnicity’ of different ancient groups: it’s a lot easier to change a population’s language (particularly the languages we’re likely to hear about — the languages of the ruling classes) than to completely replace an underlying population.
