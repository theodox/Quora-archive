The modern limited-liability corporation, which combines partial ownership and the legal 'personhood' of the company, is a late-Medieval invention. Stock markets, where partial ownership was sold commodity style, are even later.

 There were a variety of fractional ownership schemes, sometimes for the purpose of spreading risk (for example, multiple partners could club together to support a trading voyage) and sometimes to disguise the real ownership (members of the Senate were [forbidden to engage in 'trade'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Claudia)). However memberships in these groups were not sold as commodities; they were partnerships, entered into by contract, rather than corporations with shares.
