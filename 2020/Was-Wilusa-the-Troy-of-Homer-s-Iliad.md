That’s the usual guess.

The Hittite correspondence which talks about Wilusa (and the Greek-sounding Ahhiyawa) can quite plausibly be located in western Anatolia. It’s not hard to get from Wilusa to _Ilios_ , which linguists have long assumed was originally written Ϝίλιος, with the leading digamma sounding like a “w-”.

Of course, there’s no clear written trail of evidence that unambiguously proves this: we cant get much more specific about where the Hittites thought Wilusa was beyond “someplace in the west near the Ahhiyawa” and that [the Hittites and Ahhiyawa clashed over it at some point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawagalawa_letter).

On the whole the balance of evidence is pretty strong but nothing is entirely certain in the distant and very poorly documented Bronze Age. The tantalizing similarity of names makes for a very compelling theory and it certainly [adds more weight overall to the idea of a historical substrate to the Iliad](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Trojan-War-ever-happen-as-described-by-Homer-What-was-the-proof-to-back-that-claim-up/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=b158c6db&srid=zLvM) — even though the complex web of diplomacy that you see in Hittite annals seems a lot more sophisticated and “civilized” than what you get from Homer.
