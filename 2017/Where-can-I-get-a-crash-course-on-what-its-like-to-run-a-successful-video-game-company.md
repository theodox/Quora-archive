Best place to go would be the GDC the [Game Developer’s Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/), which is held every year in San Francisco around the end of February or the beginning of March. It’s the largest game developer gathering in the world and includes devs from all over the world. From technical to business to art problems, it’s a place for developers to share their stories. There are similar conferences in [China](https://www.facebook.com/ChinaJoy-796536520423145/) and [Europe](http://www.gamescom-cologne.com/gamescom/index-9.php) but they are not as focused on peer-ro-peer sharing between developers.

Full disclosure: I’m a member of the GDC advisory board, so I’m biased. But I don’t think you can do better. You can find old presentations on the GDC Vault which will give you the flavor — there are always a few free ones.
