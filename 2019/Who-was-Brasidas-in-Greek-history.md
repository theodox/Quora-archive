[Brasidas ](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/brasidas/)is a member of that rare species, the _clever Spartan._ 

During the generation-long conflict between Athens and Sparta, both sides tended to stick with a very simple playbook. Every year, a Spartan army would ravage the fields and farms outside of Athens, and the Athenians would hole up inside their city walls and watch (the Spartans, notoriously bad field engineers, never took a crack at the walls of Athens). Every year, Athenian fleets would ravage the coasts of Sparta and her allies snapping up neutral merchant shipping, and generally making life tough for people within a few miles of the sea.

But real conflicts were surprisingly rare. The war degenerated into a series of civil wars all over the Greek world, as democratic factions backed by Athens and aristocrats backed by Sparta fought each other with whatever help the two superpowers could provide.

Brasidas was a Spartan commander in northern Greece, tasked with trying to detach the Athenian colonies and allies along the northern shores of the Aegean. He is one of the most interesting Spartan generals because he was as capable off the battlefield as on it. He managed a complex diplomatic balancing act with the Macedonians, the Greek cities of the north, and the barbarian nations in Thrace and Illyria. The historian Thucydides, an Athenian and thus something of a snob about literary matters, regarded Brasidas as “not a bad speaker, though a Spartan.” His talents were widely appreciated, but Brasidas was never entirely trusted at Sparta: his flexibility and quickness made many of his Spartan contemporaries uneasy.

Brasidas was also an exception to the more typically stiff-necked Spartan approach to personal honor. He double-crossed the Macedonian king who first invited him to campaign in the north. Later, two of the cities he was trying to detach from the Athenians revolted after a truce had already been signed between Athens and Sparta; Brasidas simply pretended that the revolts had been in progress before the treaty. The Athenians, rightly spotting the dishonesty, reneged on the truce .

His army was equally untypical. It contained few Spartiate warriors: the bulk of his detachment was made up of newly-freed helots. Nevertheless he won a string of impressive victories in the north, using a mixture of force and diplomacy to induce several important Athenian allies to defect. He was known for making sudden, unexpected attacks relying on speed and surprise: a notable deviation from the more orthodox tactics favored by other Spartan generals.

Brasidas died at the [Battle of Amphipolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Amphipolis) in 422, cutting short one of the most interesting military careers in Spartan history. His mission in the north had tilted affairs their in Sparta’s favor, helping to undo the loss of face that followed from the Spartan defeat at Pylos in 425. It was his successes in the north that forced the Athenians to the negotiating table — but it is was his prevarication about the revolts which scuppered the chance for an end to the war, which would grind on (with some intermissions) for two more decades before the final Athenian defeat.

In later Greek history Brasidas was routinely cited as one of the best generals of the classical era.
