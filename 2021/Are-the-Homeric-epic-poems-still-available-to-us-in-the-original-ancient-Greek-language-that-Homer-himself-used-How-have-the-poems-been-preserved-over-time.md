Well, they’re preserved in a written form that took shape gradually between around the 8th and the 2d centuries BC.

[According to Greek tradition Homer was born around 850 BC](https://www.quora.com/What-Who-inspired-Homerus-in-the-main) — smack into the middle of the “[Greek Dark Ages,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Dark_Ages)” a period which saw the complete loss of literacy in Greece. A lot of modern scholars don’t believe in a single individual Homer and see the poems as the product of a community tradition, something like folk songs: others (and I myself) tend to think the poems started with an individual.

In either case, though, the epics didn’t start as written literature: they started as [live performances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_scholarship#Oral_Theory). Much of what makes the poems distinctive to modern ears comes from the demands of oral performance: a Homeric bard (a “rhapsode”) uses a set of rhythmic tricks to help himself keep track of complex material, and many lines are padded out with repetitious formulas (“rosy fingered dawn”, “swift-footed Achilles”, etc) which help him fill out the metre of a line without too much effort. Like the mixture of rhyme and repetition in a pop song these techniques allowed very complex material to be repeated with a high degree of consistency.

By the time we start seeing the poems in the historical record, they had passed through a couple of centuries of performances by a whole community of travelling bards who did not always agree about the details. The [Homeridae ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeridae)(the “children of Homer”) were a kind of loose clan of professional oral poets who travelled around the Greek world performing the epics and other works. If we assume a composition in the later 9th century BC, the poems were oral for at least three and a half centuries.

The written text we have today ultimately descends from efforts by Greek scholars to capture the that tradition in a canonical form. This is a tricky effort, since even the most rigorous oral traditions gradually drift over time. It’s clear that as early as a the 4th century BC there was some significant variation: Plato, for example, frequently quotes Homer but sometimes a slightly different wording than the one in our texts. Thucydides claims that Homer never uses the word “barbarian” but it appears in our editions.

The oldest effort to create a permanent written edition is believed to be the so-called “Peisistratid recension”: a written edition of Homer supposedly produced by [Onomacritus ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0104:entry=onomacritus-bio-1)around 500 BC in Athens. Oral traditions are complex, however, and many alternate versions of “Homer” continued to circulate in Greece (it didn’t help that some contemporaries accused Onomacritus of sneaking his own lines into the works he edited.) So, many Greeks were unconvinced by those early editions and the search for a “purer” and more correct version of poems continued.

By the mid-4th century BC, the effort was championed at the the Library of Alexandria, where the study of Homer was an obsessive preoccupation. The Alexandrian scholars worked extremely hard to produce the “correct” edition of Homer; they collected variants and compared them in detail, they compiled notes about obscure words and archaic phrases, and they argued ferociously among themselves, just as modern scholars do. In fact the typical markings of the modern footnote (* and †) were [invented by Alexandrian scholars to mark debated passages in Homer](https://www.fontsmith.com/blog/2017/03/29/punctuation-series-the-asterisk#:~:text=The%20asterisk%20derives%20its%20name,system%20when%20translating%20Homer's%20poetry.).

The Greek texts you’ll get today (for example, [this Iliad](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0133) and [this Odyssey](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0135%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D1)) represent the latest iteration of that same effort. The Alexandrian texts stabilized by the second century BC; we can see the results in numerous fragments of the poems which we find, still partially intact, in the [rubbish dumps of Ptolemaic Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_Oxyrhynchus_20). The Alexandrian versions became the bedrock of Greek education — for more than a thousand years all Greek school children learned them by heart — and their wide spread and standardization provided a strong check on the possibility of scribal problems.

That standardization lets us be fairly sure that our versions are solid reproduction of the Alexandrian editions — in fact, the medieval manuscripts frequently include the “footnotes” provided by Alexandrian scholars. For example our oldest complete Iliad manuscript — the[ Venetus A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetus_A) — probably [dates from the 10th century of our era](https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-know-that-the-Venetus-A-manuscript-is-from-the-10th-century-BC) but it clearly reflects the Alexandrian editions, down to the marginal notes: other manuscripts, for example the [Venetus B](https://www.homermultitext.org/manuscripts-papyri/venetusB.html) and [Escorial Y I.1](https://www.homermultitext.org/manuscripts-papyri/upsilon-1-1.html), clearly have the same complete set of commentaries so we can tell the notes are not just the jottings of an individual medieval monk. For the most part the fragments we find in Egypt (or the oldest one of all, a line of the _Odyssey_ scratched onto a potsherd in the Ukraine in the 5th century BC) are reflected in our modern editions.

Using these manuscripts, scholars for the last five hundred years or so have assembled a text which is pretty well established. There are (as always) some arguments in detail about disputed spellings or hard to construe passages — a scholarly edition will have notes explaining the choices made by the editor. However the texts is as well settled by now: for the most part you’ll find the Greek texts are quite similar even if the notes and explanations differ.

So — to finally answer the original question…

The texts we have today are very close to the standard second century BC editions. However, those editions were painstakingly assembled over three centuries from many sources, including contradictory written and oral traditions. At the time the Homeric texts became standardized, the language of the poems was sufficiently archaic that it required a lot of notes and glossaries for everyday speakers of Greek (think of a school edition of Shakespeare today, with extra help for unfamiliar words and references). We can’t be completely sure that we’re reading the words that Homer — if there was a single individual Homer — first coined in the dimness of the Greek Dark Age. We can, however, be pretty confident we’re reading the texts that a millennium and a half of Roman and Byzantine readers knew, including the obscure and archaic parts that were almost as puzzling to them as they are to us.
