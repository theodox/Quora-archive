Excellent answers already. 

I'd just add that you can hardly overestimate the effect of the depopulation of Italy from about 450 to 900. Rome declined from a population of over a million in Augustus' era to as few as 50,000; many areas did not regain their Roman peak population until the 18th c. 

So, local traditions were pretty fragile -- particularly during the Gothic invasions, the Byzantine re conquest, and the period of Arab raids. The name of a vanished local landmark ranks pretty low among the worries of your average 7th century peasant. Proximity to Naples, a much fought-over city (see [Duchy of Naples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples#Greek_birth.2C_Roman_acquisition)) probably didn't help either. And, paradoxically, the fact that Naples was in the Greek cultural orbit for a long time (until the mid 8th C) meant that the Latin literary traditions were less likely to be influential.
