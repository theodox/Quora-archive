Books in the sense you mean did not exist yet. The Romans invented them some time in the second century or so. The oldest surviving scrap of a book-bound manuscript is in Latin.

_Papyrus 745 from the British library - the oldest fragment of a book-bound work Latin and arguably the oldest one of any kind._
