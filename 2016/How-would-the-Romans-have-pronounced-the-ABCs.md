Actual Roman pronunciation has been a hotly debated topic for centuries, so the vowel quantities and overall feel are going to depend a lot on which of the varous modern reconstructions you follow.

However we do know how Greek speakers transliterated the Roman alphabet, since we have fragments of manuals for Greeks trying to learn Latin. That let’s us be sure that they didn’t say “ey bee see”. In Greek letters the Roman alphabet was pronounced

α	ah

βη	bay

κη	kay

δη	day

η	ay

εφ	ef

γη	gay

῾	"h" - a rough breathing

ι ee (short i)

κα	ka

ιλ	eel

μ "m" - unvoiced, or identical to Greek

εν	en

ω	oh

πη	pay

κου	koo

ρ	"r" - unvoiced, or identical to Greek

ες es

τη tay

ου ooh

ξη ksay

Y and Z only existed to transliterate Greek letters, so they were _y graeca_ and _zeta_.
