Helot descendants are all over Greece — they always outnumbered the Spartans (by about 7:1 according to the ancient sources) and formed a large part, if not an absolute majority, of the population of the Peloponessus in antiquity. Given the number of generations between then and now, pretty much every modern Greek has a few helots in his or her family tree. For that matter there are probably a few Spartiates as well, and bits and pieces of every other classical group you’ve heard of since after, say 80 generations there an unimaginably large number of ancestors to account for.

However there’s no unbroken chain of tradition connecting any modern family with classical Sparta — even before you get to modern history there’s a millennium and a half of the Roman period (Sparta lost it’s independence to Rome in 195 BC and remained part of the Roman empire until the fall of Constantinople in 1453). Even when Sparta fell the famous social system had been in decline for about 150 years. So, there are no ‘helot families’ or ‘helot villages’ in modern Greece.

The actual end of helotry as an institution is not well documented. It’s not clear if the institution survived the Roman conquest in any form. Plutarch, who wrote extensively about Sparta about three centuries later, definitely talks about helotry as a bygone institution and there are no documentary sources in between (for a detailed look at the end of helotry try [this ](http://qr.ae/TUT6H3)and [this](https://www.jstor.org/stable/267984?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)). The likeliest case is that some former helots became ordinary citizens of Peloponessian towns and the least fortunate ended up as regular slaves.

As for Macedonians — that’s a whole different set of people.

Our evidence for the life of ordinary people in Macedonia (as distinct from the nobility and the royal family) is extremely scanty, but it’s believed that most of the peasantry occupied a status something like serfdom. The Illyrians to the northwest and the Thracians to the north of Macedonia practiced something like serfdom, and so did the Thessalians to the south so it’s not much of a stretch to see it in Macedonia as well. However the descendants of Macedonian serfs spread far and wide after the conquests of Alexander — the first generation of Macedonian kingdoms, in particular, coveted true Macedonian soldiers, so peasants from the Macedonian heartland ended up carrying spears from the Nile to the Indus and from Ethiopia to Armenia.

Most modern Greeks will have some of these in their background as well — but so will people in Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran, though in much lower percentages. There are persistent efforts to identify populations in Afghanistan and Pakistan with lost descendants of Macedonian garrisons, from [Rudyard Kipling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Would_Be_King) to the [Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-glyn-williams/pagan-kalash-people-of-pakistan_b_4811627.html) — though all of these should be taken with more than a grain of salt, since even if you do find a bunch of European-looking folks in some isolated mountain valley they, they too have quite a lot of diverse ancestors once you go back 80 generations or so.
