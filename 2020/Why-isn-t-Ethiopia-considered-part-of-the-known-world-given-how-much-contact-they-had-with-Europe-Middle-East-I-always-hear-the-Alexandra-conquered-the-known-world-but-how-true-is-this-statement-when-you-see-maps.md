# Why isn’t Ethiopia considered part of the “known world” given how much contact they had with Europe/Middle East? I always hear the “Alexandra conquered the known world” but how true is this statement when you see maps like this?

“Known world” is a misleading modernism. It’s a standard translation for the historic Greek word οἰκουμένη _oikumene,_ which doesn’t really have an exact equivalent in English ([this answer goes into more detail on the history of the term](https://www.quora.com/Where-does-the-phrase-the-Known-World-come-from-in-reference-to-Alexander-of-Macedonia-Were-the-Greeks-not-aware-of-any-other-civilisations-except-the-Persians-and-Indians/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=ae35ce91&srid=zLvM)).

A better but clunkier translation would be “parts of the world where Greeks settled or did business,” but even that is misleadingly comprehensive. Even though the Greeks were pretty well aware of, say, Carthage or Italy a Greek speaker could say “Alexander conquered the _oikumene”_ without feeling the need to explain that he never ventured west of Libya, never campaigned in Scythia, and never visited Ethiopia.

The term’s meaning changed over time too: in early literature it seems to be limited to areas where Greeks actually settled, around Alexander’s time it meant more or less “Greece and the Persian Empire” and eventually it would come to be “The Roman Empire”. It was a non-technical category like “third world” or “the west” which different writers could use to mean different and contradictory things.

The Greeks of Alexander’s day were well aware of the existence of Ethiopia (though it’s important to remember that when they said “Ethiopia” they usually meant the Kushite kingdom of [Meroe](https://www.ancient.eu/Meroe/#:~:text=Meroe%20was%20a%20wealthy%20metropolis,Napata%20was%20sacked%20in%20c), adjacent to Egypt. They would not have much contact with the land area of modern Ethiopia until about a century after his death, when the [Ptolemies started hunting for African elephants to staff their armies](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-historical-fact-you-know-off-the-top-of-your-head). Eventually the [Kingdom of Aksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum) became a vital partner in the Indian Ocean trade network — but that was well into the Roman period.
