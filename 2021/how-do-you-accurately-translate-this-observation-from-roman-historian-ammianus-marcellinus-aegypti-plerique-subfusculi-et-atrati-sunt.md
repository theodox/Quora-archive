Here’s the whole quote in the original (Ammianus 22.16.23) :

> Homines autem Aegyptii plerique subfusculi sunt et atrati, magisque maestiores, gracilenti et aridi, ad singulos motus excandescentes, controversi et reposcones acerrimi.

> Now most men of Egypt are somewhat brownish, dark and rather gloomy, slender and lean, excitable in all their movements, quarrelsome, and most persistent debt-collectors.

_Subfuscus_ is “brown” or “swarthy” — turning into _subfusculus_ diminishes it so it’s either “somewhat brown” or “brown little people”; I think this is the only recorded usage of the word so there’s no easy way to be sure if Ammianus meant to diminish the brown-ness or the stature of the people. _Atratus_ often means “wearing mourning” or “clothed in black” but here it’s probably a reference to complexion. _Plerique_  is either “many” or “most”.
