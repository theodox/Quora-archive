Spartan culture was generally much more open to women than other cities. Spartan women were allowed to own property and to participate in city life openly, in contrast to most other Greek cities where respectable women rarely went out in public and were isolated into almost harem-like seclusion. Greeks from elsewhere were scandalized by the fact that Spartan women exercised naked at the gymnasia, just like men, and that they participated in public festivals, giving poetry readings and musical performances -- some even particpated in the Olympics. 

This degree of freedom was highly unusual: Aristotle, famously if somewhat oddly regarded this as the main reason for the decline of Sparta which was evident in his day.
 
With Spartan men often away on campaign, women played a much bigger role in managing the economy than in other Greek states: they directed farms and kept the life of the city going when the military -age male population was away. 

Spartan women could also initiate divorces, ostensibly to allow them a chance to bear 'fit' children for the state. Since the mortality rate among Spartan men tended to be high, women could amass considerable fortunes and influence -- women play a big role in the stories of [Plutarch â€¢ Life of Agis](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Agis*.html) and [Cleomenes](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cleomenes*.html) because of their wealth as well as their power over sons and husbands.
