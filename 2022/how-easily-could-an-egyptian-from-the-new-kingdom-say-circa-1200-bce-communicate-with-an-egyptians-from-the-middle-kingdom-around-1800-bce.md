An educated Egyptian of, say, Rameses II’s date could probably make due — [Middle Egyptian ](https://isaw.nyu.edu/library/blog/getting-started-with-middle-egyptian)was pretty much a “dead language” by the 13th c BC but it remained a literary and liturgical language; poets, priests, and antiquarians will have been familiar with the older written forms though they would probably struggle with spoken communications. To an Egyptian from the Middle Kingdom, a later speaker would sound rather… low class. Many of the features which distinguish [Late Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Egyptian_language) and eventually Demotic from the classical Middle Egyptian show up first in workaday documents or sometimes in the mouths of literary characters who represented peasants and tradesmen.

As a rough analogy, imagine a European of the 12th century talking to a Roman of the 4th. Both would have trouble with informal idioms and with pronunciation, but both could perhaps collaborate haltingly in writing — though later hieroglyphic writing often spells the same word somewhat differently. An interesting parallel is the fact that neither Latin nor Middle Egyptian has a definite article, where Italian and Late Egyptian both acquired one. Likewise, Late Egyptian uses helper words where Middle Egyptian uses inflections — similar to the way Latin expresses “he has seen” with one word, _viderat,_ but Italian needs two: _ha visto._ 

On the other hand if you fast forward to the Coptic era — say, adding another thousand years— it will take a real scholar to manage the transaction: that’s more like pulling a European off the street today and hoping he can talk to Cicero. Individual words will still stick out but grammar and morphology are quite different (Coptic sentences are usually subject-verb-object; ME is verb-subject-object).

For the curious:
