# If Romans called the Italian peninsula "Italia", and the Germanic region "Germania", why did they call North Africa "Africa" instead of "Afria"? Where did the "c" come from?

Typically Latin forms these kinds of “national” names from the plural version of an ethnic name. In this case, Africa is the land of the ___[Afri](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DAfer)___ ___.___ __ We don’t know exactly where _Afri_ or it’s singular _Afer_  come from; it is probably a local Berber ethonym which got applied to all the people of North Africa by extension, [much as Graecus, an equally obscure term for one Greek people became the default Latin word for all Hellenes.](https://www.quora.com/Why-were-the-ancient-Greeks-called-Yonni-Yuni-and-not-Greeks-Where-did-the-Greek-word-come-from/answer/Steve-Theodore) Or, it may be a Carthaginian word brought to Italy during the long period when Carthage controlled the western Mediterranean sea-lanes.

It would seem logical that the land of the Afri would be “Afria.” A nearby case is how the land of the _Iberes_  became _Iberia._ However the underlying ethnic names pluralize differently: one _Afer_ , many _Afri_ but one _Iber_ , many _Iberes._ When the stem of the plural ethonym ends in a consonant cluster you’ll tend to get the -ic- formation for the regional name: so _Belgae -> Belgica_ , and _Cimbri_  -> _Cimbrica_ but _Germani (_ with a single consonant) becomes _Germania_ and the _Veneti_ give us _Venetia._ 

In this case the unclear origins of _Afer/Afri_  make it a bit murkier, but it’s likely that Latin speakers fit the foreign word into the same pattern that turned _fabri_ , workers, into _fabrica_  a workshop, and _imbres_ , heavy rains, into _imbricus,_ rainy.



Incidentally, one suggested derivation for _Afer_  is a Punic word ‘_afr_ , for “dusty” — which is cognate to the Akkadian __ʿApiru 𒄩𒁉𒊒.__ [ ʿApiru is frequently cited as the origin of “Hebrew”. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habiru)In which case Latin “Africa” is “the land of the Hebrews”, a factoid which will delight some portions of the internet to no end.
