The famous conclusion of the story isn’t actually in the _Iliad_ .

The _Iliad_ covers only a short time in the ten year siege of Troy. It’s a critical moment in the story, because the feud between Agamemnon and Achilles puts the Greeks in a weak position — with Achilles sulking in his tent the Trojans come within a hair’s breadth of setting fire to Greek fleet and defeating the invasion. However Patroclus, dressed as Achilles, leads a rally which saves the day… until he’s killed by Hector, which brings Achilles back to the battle front and precipitates the last moments of the poem: the brutal death of Hector, followed by the strangely muted and humane meeting between Achilles and Priam.

The famous story of the Trojan Horse is not in the _Iliad_ . The oldest version is a quick mention in the [Odyssey, book 8](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D8%3Acard%3D469). The fully developed version of the story was elaborated by several different authors over the subsequent half-millennium.
