I’m a tough customer for historical fiction: I tend to be overly critical of both halves of the genre, which makes for a short list. There are plenty of pieces of historical fiction I’ve read and enjoyed to some degree, but the single one which floats my boat, so to speak, is without doubt is the __Aubrey-Maturin series by__ __[Patrick O’Brian](http://amzn.to/2CCdc5A)__ __.__

The series recreates the physical and political world of the 18th century Royal Navy in lovingly researched detail. You’ll learn more than you ever knew there was to know about everything from how to build a whaleboat to labor relations in a Maltese dockyard to how the Napoleonic wars affected the Java strait. For [Ron Shabbaz](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ron-Shabbaz) there are even Mirdite [Ghegs ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghegs)and rogue Osmanli beys.

But, more importantly, O’Brian is a novelist first and a retailer of historical adventure second. His characterizations are subtle and the relationships in the book are delicately shaded. The characters grow and change over the long arc of the series, and not always in predictable, Hollywood-ending fashion. These books manage to plant one foot in the world of [Horatio Hornblower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Hornblower) and the other in the world of Lizzie Bennet — I have frequently recommended O’Brian as “Jane Austen _with cannons.”_ 

If a long series seems too daunting, the different books in the set explore very different moods. There are straight up adventures and murky spy stories worthy of John Le Carre, but also leisurely studies of individual characters or places in the 19th century world. The prose vividly captures the different voices of Napoleonic-era English, from the poshest and most precise to below-decks slang.

So, there’s my vote for the best. For a more elegant way of putting it, try [this review from the NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/18/specials/obrian-plank.html).
