# Were ancient Persians black? Why is there a mural showing them as very dark skinned?

While there’s almost always more diversity in ancient populations than we tend to think, the available genetic evidence strongly suggests that modern Persians are pretty similar to their ancestors: [studies among Parsees in India and modern Iranian Zoroastrians show that they are quite closely related to their Neolithic ancestors](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aaf7943) and to the modern inhabitants of south-central Asia, particularly Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The Parsee/Zoroastrian communities tend to practice strict endogamy, so they’re less diverged from the ancestral Persian populations.

The artwork occasionally cited in this context is a mural showing Achaemenid-era archers.

It’s easy to see why this is a popular image with Afrocentrists, and it’s not at all clear what motivated the artists’ choice of pigments. The best guess is that these particular soldiers are Elamites — Susa, where the murals were found. was the capital of Elam before it was conquered by the Persians. Elamite _may_ be [related to Dravidian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamo-Dravidian_languages), which might suggest an ethnic connection between Elamites and the Dravidian peoples of India who tend to be darker-complected than modern Iranians.

In any case: there’s plenty of other pictorial evidence for the appearance of Persians in antiquity, and the rest of it does not present this appearance. For a summary see



For what it’s worth, here’s a contemporary depiction of a Persian from roughly the same time as the archer murals:

The wood painted [Tatartli Tumulus](https://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/kuniholm2009a.pdf) in Phrygia includes scenes featuring Persians, Scythians and Greeks — all depicted without any distinction of complexion.
