# During World War Two, Japan sent pilots on suicide missions. They had their planes filled with explosives and dashed into American warships. Why didn't Japan just use missiles?

Everyone is correct, the Japanese did not have anti-ship guided missiles. 

The Germans did, however:

and so did the US:

However another factor is the absence of trained pilots. By 1944 the Japanese air and naval air forces had been decimated, so the ability to launch significant conventional attacks was rapidly being lost. Removing the usual considerations of safety, acceptable losses, and force preservation radically simplified the equation for the Japanese planners - although at a terrible cost.
