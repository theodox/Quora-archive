You’re looking for _[basilica.](https://quatr.us/romans/roman-basilicas-architecture-ancient-rome.htm)_ 

A basilica can be thought of as something like what we in the US call a “community center” — a mixed use building that serves a mix of public and private purposes. A Roman basilica functioned as a law court, as a place for meetings (say, a city council or a board of magistrates). However it could also be used for lectures, for business dealings (it was a common place for bankers to set up their stalls) or even for selling food.

The basic form was a long, high hall with a colonnaded aisle on each side. One or both ends would have a semicircular niche, the [apse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apse), where there was usually a statue of the emperor — so that he could preside, symbolically, over the public business conducted in the hall.

After Christianity became legal the basilica form became the basis of most church designs. Churches needed an enclosed space, since their services involved lectures (pagan temples didn’t have the equivalent of sermons) . Christian bishops also had judicial authority, presiding over family law cases. The basilica was a natural fit for both purposes — so much so that[ Catholic tradition still uses the term ‘basilica’ for churches that serve a special community role](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Catholic_basilicas), often (but not always) derived from a late Roman church. The emperor’s statue was typically replaced by a mosaic depiction of a biblical or symbolic scene. The primary difference between a Christian and a secular basilica was that the main entrance was moved from the side to the long axis of the building, encouraging visitors to focus on the altar as they entered.

This form was the basis for the style we call [Romanesque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesque_architecture) in the middle ages.
