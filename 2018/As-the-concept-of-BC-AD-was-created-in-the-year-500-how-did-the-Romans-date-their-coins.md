Generally they did not — at least, not with reference to some general notion of serial time. Historians used a reference to the founding of the city (traditionally, our 754 BC), a dating system known as [Ab urbe condita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_urbe_condita) or “from the building of the city” — but nobody used this for practical purposes. In the Republic, the only “dates” that mattered to most Romans were the names of the reigning consuls — you might say “I was born in the year of [Claudius Marcellus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus) and [Cornelius Scipio Calvus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnaeus_Cornelius_Scipio_Calvus)” (= 222 BC) but that was about as specific as it got.

In the Republican period coins generally had minimal inscriptions, usually just ROMA or sometimes a reference to the denomination. As the Republic began to disintegrate, warlords like Sulla and Caesar put their own names on coins — this lets us date them with some certainty but they did not carry actual dates.

_This coin is datable to 54 BC because it was issued by Brutus (the later assassin of Caesar) when he was a junior magistrate. It features his famous ancestor,_ _[Lucius Junius Brutus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Junius_Brutus)_ _and the early Republican hero_ _[Servilius Ahala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Servilius_Ahala)_ _— presentiments of Brutus’ own future as the enemy of a tyrant._ 

Under the early empire the coinage always or almost always carried the name of the reigning emperor and usually some list of honors or achievements which give us an idea of the date. For example this one of Augustus

is firmly dated to 28 BC by the inscription COS VI in the inscription which indicates it was struck during Augustus’ sixth consulship.

Sometimes in the provinces — particularly in the east, where [the habit of using serial dates had been picked up by the Seleucid empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_era) — coins did bear a mark indicating reference to an important historical date. For example this is a coin of Nero struck in Antioch, Syria.

Under the eagle it says ΕΤΟΥΣ AIP ° I — which translates to “Year 111 ° 10 ” - that is, 111 years after Caesar defeated Pompey at Pharsalus, in our 48 BC, and 10 years into Nero’s reign. This system spread slowly in the eastern provinces, so a coin like this of Trajan’s

from Egypt indicates year 15 of his reign ( split over our 111 and 112). The “L” is not a letter but symbol for “year”, IE are Greek numerals for “15”.

The western mints never really picked up that provincial habit. It wasn’t until the 500’s that regnal-year coins showed up in the west — here’s a coin of Justinian, who briefly recaptured Italy for the Empire,

issued in his 15th year (ANNO on the left and XV on the right).

Apparently the oldest coin with an explicit AD date is this:

Which comes from Denmark and dates to 1234 (M:CC:XXX:IIII)
