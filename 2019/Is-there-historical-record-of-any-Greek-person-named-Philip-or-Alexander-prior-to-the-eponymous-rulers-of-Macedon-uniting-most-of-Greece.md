They’re both perfectly ordinary Greek names.

_Alexandros_  is very old — it’s one of the names used by Paris in the Iliad. It means literally “protector of men”.

_Philippos_  means “Horse lover” — there are many Greek names using the same roots, such as _Philonomos (_ “Lover of order”) or _Archippos_  (“Master of horses”). In many versions of the story, the man who ran the first ‘marathon’ to tell the story of the Greek victory there in 490 BC is _Philippides,_ “Son of Philip”.
