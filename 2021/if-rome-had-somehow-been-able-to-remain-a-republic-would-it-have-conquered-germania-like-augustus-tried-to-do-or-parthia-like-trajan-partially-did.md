# If Rome had somehow been able to remain a republic, would it have conquered Germania, like Augustus tried to do, or Parthia, like Trajan partially did?

The late republic was, in general, more predatory than the empire that followed it. The ambitious political generals who followed Marius and Sulla found foreign conquests translated directly into domestic political power: Caesar’s conquest of Gaul was primarily motivated by his desire to catch up to his rivals Pompey and Crassus.

So, a republic that lasted another century might actually have been more inclined towards territorial expansion than the empire of Augustus and Tiberius. On the other hand political infighting at home and the rotation of commanders in the field might easily have made the process more inefficient and erratic: venality and ambition might inspire you to _attempt_ conquest but they don’t necessarily make you very good at conquering.

Caesar’s conquest of Gaul is an anomaly, only made possible by the stranglehold which he, Pompey and Crassus had over the regular republican political process. A long messy period of slow encroachments, strategic disarray, and piecemeal expansion would have been a lot more likely in a long republic than anything as sweeping and systematic as Caesar’s campaigns.

However, there was simply a lot more _money_ in places other than Germania. Territory for it’s own sake was not very interesting to your average Roman politician: Caesar was given Gaul in part because he was the junior partner in the triumvirate. Asia and Syria (and Egypt, since without Augustus it would not yet have been provincialized) would be where the most ambitious and politically connected Romans would have concentrated their machinations. Dacia might eventually have made it onto the target list — those Dacian gold mines were exactly the sort of thing to set an ambitious young Roman’s imagination on fire. The bogs and forests of Germany, not so much.
