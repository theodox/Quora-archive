C# runs fine on linux and mac using [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) -- that's how [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) works, for example. There are some edge cases where the Mono runtime is less than precisely the same as the DotNet version but they aren't common, and now that DotNet is [open source](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/11/12/net-core-is-open-source.aspx) that will only get better.
