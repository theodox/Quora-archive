The Latin word is [cloaca ](https://lsj.gr/wiki/cloaca)— I’ve always thought it was onomatopoeic, but the professionals say it derives from the verb _[cluo](https://lsj.gr/wiki/cluo)_ , “to purge”

_Parts of the Cloaca Maxima, the great sewer of Rome, still survive. Photos:_ _[teggelar.com](https://www.teggelaar.com/en/rome-day-3/)_ 

The word [has been recycled by biologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca) for a variety of uses, generally in the lower half of things.
