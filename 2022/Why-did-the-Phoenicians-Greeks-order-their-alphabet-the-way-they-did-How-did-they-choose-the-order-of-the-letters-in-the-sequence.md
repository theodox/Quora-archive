# Why did the Phoenicians/Greeks order their alphabet the way they did? How did they choose the order of the letters in the sequence?

The short answer is _“somebody in Ugarit made the decision, but we don’t know why.”_ 

The alphabetic order in all the scripts which descended from Phoenician — which is nearly every alphabet or abjad in the Eastern Hemisphere — is first recorded in a script that doesn’t look one bit like Phoenician. The [Ugaritic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugaritic_alphabet) (or more properly, the Ugaritic _[abjad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad#:~:text=An%20abjad%20(%2F%CB%88%C3%A6b,Daniels.)_ ) looks more or less like cuneiform, though it does not seem to actually share glyphs with cuneiform.

It’s possible that the Ugaritic signs are efforts to capture the original pictographic characters of the [Proto-Sinaitic script](https://www.quora.com/Did-illiterate-Canaanite-miners-really-make-the-breakthrough-from-hieroglyphs-to-an-alphabet/answer/Steve-Theodore), which is the point where Egyptian hieroglyphs were adapted to write the consonants of Semitic languages. However the resemblances are a bit conjectural, so can’t be certain.

What we do know is that the scribes of Ugarit are the first people we know of who had the idea of using a standardized order for their letters. In fact, they had _two_  orders: one for North-Semitic languages like Phoenician and Hebrew and as separate order beginning ___h l ḥ m q___ for____ South Semitic languages, such as Ge’ez or Sabaean.

Unfortunately we don’t really know what the logic behind the ordering really was. The fact that the same city-state produced both orders suggests that maybe there was a mnemonic associated with each one — a poem or song or something that made it easy to memorize — but that there were two different language communities using different mnemonics appropriate to their own culture and languages. If you follow the North Semitic order your alphabet song 𐤀 [ʾālep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph), 𐤁 [bēt,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bet_(letter)) 𐤂 [gīml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimel), 𐤃 [dalet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalet) — in Phoenician “ox, house, boomerang, fish”* — it’s hard to say what kind of story or poem went with that, so clearly there must be missing pieces that we can’t recover tying it together. It’s also possible that the order was purely conventional and had no meaning at all.

In any case, though, it’s been remarkably tenacious over the last three thousand years. Although many scripts have tweaked that original Ugaritic order down the millennia it’s still recognizable in dozens of living languages.

* Giml might be “camel” — that’s what it became in Hebrew and Arabic — but the glyph looks like a throwing stick. Dalet is clearly a fish (dag) in some Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions — it’s used in the family tree above — but again in Hebrew and Arabic today it’s “door.”
