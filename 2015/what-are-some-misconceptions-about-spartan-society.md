There's really two questions here: one about common misconceptions, and one about Plutarch's portrayal. I'm going to concentrate on the latter: since the release of the movie 300, there are way too many misconceptions to count (although I'll mention: six pack abs, fighting in speedos, and MMA style fighting on the battlefield).

Plutarch wrote several hundred years after the events he describes in _Lycurgus_ , but he also knew about the "Spartan Revival" movements under [Agis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agis_IV). [Cleomenes III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleomenes_III), and [Nabis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabis) which were much closer to him in time - about the same distance as separates us from the American revolution. Although the classical Spartan lifestyle was long gone by Plutarchs' time it was a well known aspect of Greek culture: in the same way a modern Briton has some general idea of the way things went in the age of Shakespeare, a Greek of Plutarch's time had a lot of context for understanding the Spartan traditions. He also had written sources we've lost, as well as access to authors like Herodotus and Thucydides who knew the classical system at first hand. His picture is certainly simplified, and (because the Spartans were averse to written constitutions and laws) can't easily be verified by reference to archaeological evidence. 

That said, the big outlines that Plutarch sketches out are reflected in other sources. The [Syssitia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syssitia) or mess hall system and the thorough militarization of the Spartiate class are well attested through other sources, as is the relative freedom of women (which Aristotle, strangely, blamed for the decay of Sparta!) 

If you only read _Lycurgus,_  you get an "ideal" of Sparta: essential and unchanging. Part of the reason it comes off so perfectly is that Sparta was a beacon for aristocratic conservatism throught Greek history: a system in which the nobility kept the rural laborers in perpetual submission, but also lives a life of self denial and civic virtue -- immune to the corruption and factionalism that poisoned public life in most Greek cities -- was a very appealing one if you were a landowning aristocrat in Thebes or Athens ([Xenophon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon), even more than Plutarch, wins the prize for the most fawning appreciation of the Spartan system). By Plutarch's day this image was almost entirely nostalgic: a Sir Walter Scott version of feudalism. But it was still attractive to Plutarch, so it tends to be idealized.

 However we do know that the Spartan system was much less monolithic and enduring than the idea: the career of [Pausanias ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pausanias_%28general%29) at the end of the Persian War, for example, shows that Spartans were just as capable as anyone else of treachery and self-interested double dealing. In the idealized view the political divisions which led to the exile of [Demaratus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demaratus), the rise of [Lysander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander), and the ups-and-downs of [Agesilaus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agesilaus_II) career are glossed over the common perception. However Plutarch is a good source for many of these: if you read the lives of Agis and Cleomenes, the life of Lysander and the life of Agesilaos you get a much better rounded picture of a real Sparta where personal ambition and all the usual human vices are not erased. You can also see how the system decays from the classical period. 

 Plutarch is always a dramatist first, a philosopher second, and a historian third. Luckily, the demands of drama tend to override his desire to make Sparta into a timeless ideal like Plato's Republic, so he gives us some pretty vivid pictures of a more human Sparta if you read the other sources.
