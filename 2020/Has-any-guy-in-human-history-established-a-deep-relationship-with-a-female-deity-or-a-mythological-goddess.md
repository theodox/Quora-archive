It’s an old, old idea but it has a troubled history.

The oldest cautionary tale is that of [Dumuzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumuzid). He was the king of Uruk and the lover of the Sumerian goddess Innana (more famous under her Akkadian name, Ishtar). She got herself trapped in the underworld by her sister, Ereshkighal the Queen of the Dead. The only way out was to find a substitute — so she dispatched a couple of demons to drag Dumuzi down to the underworld in her place. Eventually she felt bad about it and arranged for another sister, Geshtinanna, to take Dumuzi’s place in the underworld for six months a year, so he’s only _half_  trapped in the realm of the dead. Still: not a good start for guy-divine gal relations. The entire story is told in the Sumerian poem [Inanna's Descent](https://www.ancient.eu/article/215/inannas-descent-a-sumerian-tale-of-injustice/), which dates to about 1900 BC.

Innana / Ishtar had something of a bad reputation on this score. She was very impressed by the mighty deeds and massive pecs of the next king of Uruk, the famous [Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh). So, she invited him to become her lover, but he refused — citing the way she treated Dumuzi:

> Your lovers have found you like a brazier which smoulders in the cold, a backdoor which keeps out neither squall of wind nor storm, a castle which crushes the garrison, pitch that blackens the bearer, a water skin that chafes the carrier.

The Innana / Ishtar story had a long afterlife in the Near East. Eventually it found its way to Greece where we know it as the story of [Adonis](https://www.theoi.com/articles/who-is-adonis-in-greek-mythology/). There are a few different versions of the story — but all of them end up with Adonis trapped in the underworld for part of the year.

The Greeks also had their own stories about men who had romances with goddesses. None of them had what you’d call happy endings.

The goddess [Eos](https://www.theoi.com/Titan/Eos.html) — familiar to centuries of school children as Homer’s “Rosy-fingered dawn” — liked to get her rosy fingers on young men, which tended not to work out too well. There was [Tithonus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithonus), a Trojan prince, whom she seemed to like quite a lot. So much so, in fact, that she asked Zeus to grant him immortality, which he did. Unfortunately she _forgot_  to ask for eternal youth as well, so eventually the immortal Tithonus withered away into a kind of undying husk; in the most popular version of the myth he eventually shrank and dried up until he became the first cricket. Eos also seduced [Cephalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalus_of_Phocis), a mighty hunter who was already married. When he would not stop pining for his wife, she sent him back — but Eos arranged matters so that Cephalus and his wife remained mutually suspicious, leading eventually to her death in a hunting accident as she stalked her husband to see if he was cheating on her.

Eos had a sister with similar tastes. [Selene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selene), the goddess of the moon, took up with the handsome lad [Endymion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endymion_(mythology)) She learned from her sister’s mistake with Tithonus, however, and made sure to ask Zeus to grant him eternal youth. However Zeus decided to preserve him by putting him to sleep, forever, so he remained alive but asleep in a cave on mount Latmos in Asia Minor. He did, however, manage to father 50 daughters while asleep, so presumably his dreams were pleasant.

Hopefully, you’re starting to see the theme here. There are other cautionary tales in the same vein; for example, there was [Ixion,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixion) who fell in love with Hera. Zeus tricked him into sleeping with a cloud, magically shaped like Hera; their offspring were the half-human centaurs. Zeus completed Ixion’s punishment the old fashioned way, with a thunderbolt. There was [Actaeon](https://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ArtemisWrath.html#Aktaion), who had peeped at Artemis, the goddess of the hunt and a resolute man-hater while she was bathing; she turned him into a stag, and he was torn apart by his own hunting dogs.

Probably the only man-goddess relationship that turned out less than tragically was Odysseus’ stay with [Calypso](https://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheKalypso.html). She seemed to be interested in long-term relationship, right up to and including the eternal youth; but Odysseus just wanted to go home to his wife and eventually she had to let him leave.

> Queenly Kalypso smiled; and caressing him with her hand she answered : ‘You are all too cunning. No innocent could have mustered such words as those. So be it then--let Earth be witness to me in this, and the arching Heaven above, and the downward water of the Styx--most solemn and most fearsome of oaths with the blessed gods--that I will plot against you no new mischief to your ruin. No; I have in mind--I will ponder now--the very plans I would shape for myself if ever need pressed as hard on me. My whole bent is to honest dealing; in this breast of mine there is no heart of iron; I have compassion.’

> So she spoke, this lovely divinity, and led the way forthwith; Odysseus followed in her footsteps. Goddess and man reached the arching cavern; Odysseus sat down in the chair that Hermes had risen from, and Kalypso put in front of him all manner of things such as mortal men eat and drink, then sat down herself facing the king while her handmaids served her with nectar and ambrosia. He and she stretched out their hands to the dishes there; but when they had eaten and drunk their fill, Kalypso the goddess thus began : ‘Son of Laertes, subtle Odysseus--so then, your mind is firmly set on returning now without delay to your home and country? Go then, and joy go with you, in spite of all. Yet if you knew--if you fully knew--what miseries are fated to fill your cup before you attain your own land, you would choose to stay here, to join with me in calm possession of this domain, to be beyond reach of death--this despite all your zeal to see once more the wife that you yearn for, day by day. And yet I doubt if I fall behind her in form and feature--for indeed it would be unbecoming that mortal women should vie in form an face with immortal goddesses.’

> Subtle Odysseus answered her : ‘Goddess and queen, do not make this a cause of anger with me. I know the truth of everything you say; I know that my wise Penelope, when a man looks at her, is far beneath you in form and stature; she is a mortal, you are immortal and unageing. Yet, not withstanding, my desire and longing day by day is still to reach my own home and see the day of my return. And if this or that divinity should shatter my craft on the wine-dark ocean, I will bear it and keep a bold heart within me. Often enough before this time have war and wave oppressed and plagued me; let new tribulations join the old.’

> So he spoke; and the sun sank and darkness came; then the pair withdrew, and in a recess of the arching cavern they took their pleasure in love, and did not leave one another's side.

> Eos comes early with rosy fingers. When she appeared, Odysseus put on his cloak and tunic; the Nymphe put on a long silvery mantle, graceful and delicate; she fastened a lovely gold girdle round her waist and slipped a scarf over her head. Then she turned her mind to helping his departure.

In the grim world of mythology, it’s rather sweet. But Odysseus was always lucky. My advice is, __don’t try this at home.__
