Gramatically, your try is fine. Flavor-wise, I’d try _eligat mercatus_ , if you’re trying to echo _caveat emptor_ .

_Forum_ emphasizes the ‘place’ in ‘marketplace’, but not the commercial activity itself; _mercatus_  comes from [mercor](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=cerno&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059) and is more strongly connected with buying, selling and haggling. Mercatus also sounds like “market” (for obvious reasons) which may or may not be a plus depending on your tastes.

_[Eligo](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Deligo)_ __ has a strong suggestion of ‘picking out’ (it literally means ‘to pluck’, like you’d pull a carrot from the ground or an apple off the apple cart). _[Cerno](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=cerno&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059)_ __ implies intellectual assessment and perception but not really the act of choice: in English the first word gives us ‘election’ (like, “what’s your health plan election?”) and the second ‘discernment’, which gives the flavor of the difference between the originals. The secondary meaning of decision in _cerno_  is implicitly the decision of a legal case as “seen” by the judge and jury.
