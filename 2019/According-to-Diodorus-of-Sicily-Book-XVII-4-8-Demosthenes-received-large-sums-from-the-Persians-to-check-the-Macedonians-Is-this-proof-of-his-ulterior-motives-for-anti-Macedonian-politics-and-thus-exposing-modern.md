# According to Diodorus of Sicily (Book XVII 4.8), Demosthenes received large sums from the Persians to 'check' the Macedonians. Is this proof of his ulterior motives for anti-Macedonian politics and thus exposing modern Macedonist propaganda?

All it really illustrates is the classic Persian strategy in Greece — subsidize anybody who will take your money in order to throw sand in the gears of whatever power is dominant in Greece at the time. The Persians paid the Spartans to fight the Athenians, the Athenians to fight the Spartans, the Spartans again to keep a lid on all the other Greeks, the Athenians and their friends to fight the Macedonians, and finally the Spartans to rise up against the Macedonians while Alexander was conquering the Middle East.

Demosthenes is always out to blacken the reputation of his Macedonian adversaries by any means necessary. There’s no reason to assume that this wasn’t a purely personal mission for him — in this regard he’s actually remarkably consistent for an Athenian politician. With the benefit of hindsight it seems quite clear that an Athenian patriot (and the Persians!) _ought_ to have been intensely suspicious of Macedonian power in Demosthenes’ day. Even pro-Macedonian Athenians like [Phocion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocion) saw the rise of Macedon as a disturbing development, though they hoped that appeasement would work better than outright opposition.

As for “modern Macedonist propaganda” — the only thing that Demosthenes’ endlessly re-quoted statements describing Philip as a “barbarian” really proves is that such a charge was expected to stick. The image of the Macedonians at the time was sufficiently ambiguous that denying their Hellenic credentials would seem like a serious charge to some people. It proves that Macedonia occupied a place in the imagination of southern Greeks that was dubious enough for such a charge to make sense as a political tactic — certainly not that some kind of sober analysis of Macedonian culture produced a clear, scientific consensus. It doesn’t prove anything about the actual ethnic makeup of Macedon in 21st century or the 4th century BC except that there was room for debate two and a half millennia ago.
