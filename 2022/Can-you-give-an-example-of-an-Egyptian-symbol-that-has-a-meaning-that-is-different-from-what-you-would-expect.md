This one here is a double surprise.

On the one one hand, the graphic appearance doesn’t quite tell the story. Canonically [F35 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefer)is supposed to represent _a sheep’s heart and esophagus._ You thought it was a lute or a guitar, didn’t you?

But the other surprise is the meaning. __Nfr__ is the Egyptian word for “beauty” or “perfection” — it’s the Nefer in “[Nefertiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertiti)” . I’ll be honest, I don’t quite get the sheep entrails -> perfection symbolism. Perhaps is connected to a long lost divination practice? More likely it’s just a 5,000 year old pun, which is awesome and irritating in equal measure.
