Leguntur would ‘they are read’ but it’s verbal, rather than nominal: you can’t use it as noun in this sense because unlike the gerundives it’s not declinable.

If you want ‘the things currently being read’ might probably want [lectiones](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=lectio&la=la#lexicon), which corresponds to our ‘readings’. Or you could work around it with something like_ea que leguntur._
