It’s actually an interesting technical question.

In the broadest sense the answer is yes, since — at least at the height of his power, Augustus was undoubtedly Agrippa’s superior in influence he worked to promote Agrippa’s career. Agrippa generally showed ostentatious deference to Augustus in public (for example, refusing two different triumphs, in 31 and 19). He never ventured on a public break from Augustus’ policies — even when, it’s thought, he was temporarily shuffled aside to make room for Augustus’s nephew [Marcellus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus_(Julio-Claudian_dynasty))

In all these ways Agrippa showed the classic deference of a client. He was, after all, a _novus homo_  — an outsider with no other connections inside the Senatorial elite. In traditional Roman politics he would have been expected to remain in Augustus’s shadow despite his many accomplishments.

However the relationship between Augustus and Agrippa doesn’t always look like the traditional patron-client relationship. Augustus relied implicitly on Agrippa at many points in his career — Agrippa was the real victor at Actium, and the only lieutenant Augustus could count on for any emergency. The special status of their relationship is clearly shown in the fact that the two men were co-consuls twice, in back-to-back years ( 28 and 27). In traditional Rome, a good client would never run the chance of upstaging his patron; for the two comrades to appear together two years in a row was a public proclamation of the unusual nature of their relationship.

When Augustus nearly died in 23, Augustus gave him the imperial signet ring as proof that he was the chosen heir. Later, Augustus would marry his daughter Julia to Agrippa; as his only child, this was the highest possible form of alliance. Eventually, Augustus would adopt Agrippa’s sons Gaius and Lucius as his heirs in the most public manner possible. This level of intimacy between a patron and client was highly untraditional, particularly when the patron was a blue-blood who descended from the oldest families of the Republic and the client was a provincial without a single consul in his family tree.

Maybe the easiest explanation is the fact that traditional Roman mores were in rapid evolution during the lifetime of Augustus. Just as he pretended to follow the old rules in his politics while completely ignoring their spirit, Augustus and Agrippa publicly enacted the roles of patron and client while in fact morphing them into something new and unprecedented.
