As is usual for these things, we’re dependent on only Roman sources who had pretty erratic knowledge about things outside their own borders. It does seem like Radagaisus’ grouping was a mixed, not a mono-ethnic group; but from his name and contemporary sources he himself was a Goth. Beyond that, though, we don’t have much to go on. The attack route was southerly, through Raetia via Vindelicia — the region around Augsburg, so Radagaisus was coming down from Germany and not west from the Balkans — but in those highly mobile times its hard to know what to make of that.

[Orosius](http://www.attalus.org/latin/orosius7B.html), describes Radagaisus as a Goth, a “true Scythian”; he contrasts him to Alaric who was “a kind of Christian, and more like a Roman” (fair enough - Alaric was technically a Roman general). I suspect in this case “true Scythian “ is intended to distinguish between Radagaisus’ wildness and Alaric’s relatively civilized posture, not as a pointer towards, say, the Ukraine as a geographical origin.

[Zosimus](http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/03d/0490-0510,_Zosimus,_Historia_Nova_(Green_and_Chaplin_AD_1814),_EN.pdf) says Radagaisus “collected four hundred thousand of the Celts, and the German tribes that dwell beyond the Danube and the Rhine” ; it’s not clear again how precisely this is meant, but it would probably put the stepping-off point in the elbow of the frontiers, north of Augsburg and east of Stuttgart.

[Claudian ](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/De_Bello_Gothico*.html#)says that Stilicho stripped the Rhine defenses entirely, “leaving the Rhine, whose garrison they had formed, defended by but one thing — the fear of the name of Rome”. Assuming Stilicho had some choice in the matter, that move is plausible if that the main opposing force on the upper Rhine was Radagaisus himself.

If you really want to go deep, try this : [The Visigoths from the Migration Period to the Seventh Century](https://www.amazon.com/Visigoths-Migration-Period-Seventh-Century/dp/1843830337/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1486023313&sr=1-1&keywords=9781843830337) has some more detail (unfortunately the[ online version](https://books.google.com/books?id=4MADmH2eaGIC&lpg=PA51&ots=Y2waagLhvJ&dq=jordanes%20radagaisus&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q=jordanes%20radagaisus&f=false) blanks out some of the relevant pages.) Compare with chapter 5 in [Barbarian Tides](https://books.google.com/books?id=Qr43XNyZh6AC&pg=PA298&lpg=PA298&dq=claudian+radagaisus&source=bl&ots=mkxdf3juWq&sig=Se6_xaxD4OByX8NhF2VBXyNpDvw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmzIGWvO_RAhVEzFQKHUytDrcQ6AEIMzAH#v=onepage&q=claudian%20radagaisus&f=false), esp. the footnotes :)
