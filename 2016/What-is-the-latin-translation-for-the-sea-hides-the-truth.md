_mare veritatem abdit_ or _mare veritatem occultat_ 

would both work. The first implies more of something being put away out of sight, the latter of something deliberately hidden. You can mess with the word order more or less at will, since the endings of the words provide the sense â€” the order I gave (subject, object, verb) is the commonest one but you could use others for rhythm or spacing
