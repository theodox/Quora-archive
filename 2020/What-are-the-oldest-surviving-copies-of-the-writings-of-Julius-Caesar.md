The oldest manuscript copies of the Gallic War are from around the 9th century — [there’s more details in this answer.](https://www.quora.com/Where-can-the-authentic-manuscript-of-Commentari-de-Bello-Gallico-written-by-Gaius-Julius-Caesar-be-found/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=16ab45b8&srid=zLvM) The oldest manuscripts of the civil war is codex laurentianus ashburham 33, which is a bit later, probably 10th c. Unfortunately none of the really old ones seem to be available online.

_A bit of an older MS (this one is_ _[Bibliothèque nationale de France Latin 5767](https://gallica.bnf.fr/edit/und/null)_ _from the early 13th century)._
