For starters, it was how they knew how to write. Hieroglyphs are as close as you can get to a natural evolution from pictographs, but the Egyptians moved them into what you might call a “fully capable” writing system pretty fast; by around 2500 BC they were able to express anything they could say in writing, although the system they evolved to do so was complex enough that only specialists could read and write it.

Complexity aside the main drawback of hieroglyphs is that they are hard to write, particularly when you it’s important to distinguish between something like and . So, Egyptians evolved the [Hieratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieratic) script which was designed to be written more fluidly with a brush and ink:

This is much more abstract, so you need to learn the symbols — but it lacks the finicky details of hieroglyphs and is more efficient to write.

Hieratic tended to be the workaday script of government, but it was still fairly “official”. Egyptians were intensely conservative in matters of style: they continued to use hieroglyphs in public settings — particularly in temples, tombs, and royal monuments — even while they used Hieratic for practical purposes. Later and even more simplified script called [Demotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)) emerged for the business of ordinary life.

Demotic was gradually edged out by Greek letter forms during the 900 years when Greek was the language of government in Egypt: the [Coptic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language), the latest form of Egyptian, looks like this when written:
