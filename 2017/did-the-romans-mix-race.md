They didn’t have the modern — or more properly, the 19th and early 20th century — concept of “race” (more background in [What was the status of black people in the Roman Empire?](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-status-of-black-people-in-the-Roman-Empire)).

Generally there were two different kinds of assimilation and mixing going on at the same time.

On the one hand, this was a conservative aristocratic society; birth meant a lot, and marrying outside one’s _class_  was a huge deal. An aristocratic Roman boy or girl didn’t marry for love, and the family elders who arranged those kinds matches didn’t go shopping outside an exclusive circle of privileged people. That privileged circle could be non-Roman — although there were definitely ultraconservative holdouts who cared about purity of descent the real criteria were wealth and power. This started as Rome expanded throughout Italy and the aristocracies of other Italian cities started assimilating into Roman society. Once the empire expanded to its full extent, the upper classes became increasingly less “Roman” and more “imperial”> A good example would be the family of emperor [Septimius Severus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimius_Severus). His mother was from the Italian gentry, but his father (despite the Romanized name of [Publius Septimius Geta)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Septimius_Geta_(father_of_Septimius_Severus)) was a North African of Carthaginian or Libyan descent; the future emperor grew up speaking Punic, rather than Latin. As an adult, he married a wealthy Syrian heiress, [Julia Domna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Domna). In later years of the empire — after about the year 100 — upper ranks of Imperial society were full of all sorts of people whose main commonality was wealth and power rather than ethnic or even aristocratic pedigree.

_Septimius Severus and family. Don’t read too much into the difference in complexions; women and children were usually depicted some shades lighter than men, particularly soldiers._ 

Among ordinary people things were much more complicated.

[In rural areas, most people were peasants tied to the land](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170620114103.htm) — they didn’t move much and their opportunities for interacting with people from the rest of the Roman world were very limited.

However the cities —especially the big cities — were complex melting pots with people of all sorts. Syrian merchants dominated the merchant scene in Roman London; Egyptian doctors served clients in Marseille and Athens; Roman businesses banked with Spanish bankers, and Greek craftsmen decorated villas from Morocco to Armenia. The total numbers involved were small by modern standards — travel was expensive and difficult — but there were still a lot of people moving around and, pretty much inevitably, mixing. Soldiers usually settled down where they served, and generally married local women. Merchants might be able to afford to import a bride from home, but often they’d end up marrying locals or not uncommonly marrying slaves (a good example might be [the Syrian flag-merchant Barathes,](https://thematiccollectingmanchester.wordpress.com/2015/07/27/thematic-collecting-migration-barates-the-palmyran-in-roman-britain/) who sold to the Roman garrison on Hadrian’s wall in Britain, and his British wife). In Roman Egypt, [mixed marriages were extremely common among ordinary people ](https://books.google.com/books?id=4wPAmml1G9sC&lpg=PA269&ots=Yt1oyYXSv6&dq=mixed%20marriage%20roman%20egypt&pg=PA269#v=onepage&q=mixed%20marriage%20roman%20egypt&f=false)— in fact many records from this period show families where one child has a clearly Egyptian name and a sibling has a Greek or Roman one.

If you’re thinking strictly of Sub-saharan Africans, they were pretty rare in the Roman world, The Romans had[ very limited contact with anywhere south of Sudan or Morocco](https://www.quora.com/How-far-or-deep-into-Africa-did-the-Romans-reach/answer/Steve-Theodore), but in cities, at least, the sight of an African wasn’t unheard of or outlandish. One documented instance of ‘interracial’ romance in that sense is a bit ambiguous. The [Aethiopica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aethiopica) of Heliodorus (full text [here](http://www.elfinspell.com/HeliodorusTitle.html)) written in the mid-3rd century. It concerns the adventure of an Aethiopian princes (“Aethiopia” was very vague term for Greeks and Romans — it could include India as well as sub-saharan Africa) who was magically born light skinned and, because her mother was worried what her father her would think , raised in exile in Roman Egypt. She has a series of improbable adventures but the end result is her happy marriage to a Greek nobleman. The strange bit about a white child born to dark-skinned parents rather undercuts the we-are-the-world messaging, but it clearly indicates that such an alliance was not regarded as unthinkable. There was, at any rate, [a long tradition in Greek literature holding that “Aethiops” were the handsomest and most favored of peoples](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Ancient-Greeks-refer-to-Ancient-Blacks-the-Ethiopians-as-blameless-and-favored-by-the-gods-Also-what-does-it-mean).

_I’m not sure the artist intended this as a sub-saharan African, but it’s possible._ 

On the other hand [Juvenal’s Satire VI ](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/JuvenalSatires6.htm)— which catalogs many forms of unchastity while trying to warn a friend away from marrying — also complains that

> if she had chosen to let vigorous boys vex and stretch 
Her belly, you might have been father to an Ethiopian! Your dark heir,
Barely visible at dawn, would soon be seen everywhere in the will.

That’s distinctly disapproving (another translation of “barely visible at dawn” might be “whom you wouldn’t want to meet in daylight”). On the other hand Juvenal, famously, disapproves of _everything_  so it’s not necessarily a great guide to attitudes at large.
