“Home” as in “homewards” is _domum,_ without a preposition:

> ___Brian___ _: "Ahh! No, not the dative, not the dative, sir. No, the, accusative, accusative, 'ad domum', sir!"_ ___Centurion___ _: "Except that 'domus' takes the ...?"_ ___Brian___ _: "The_ _[locative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locative_case)_ _, sir!"_ ___Centurion___ _: "Thus it is ...?!"_ ___Brian___ _: "'Domum'."_ 

But! When referring to “home” for a bunch of people the plural is also good — so ___domos___  works as well as ___domum___ _._ On the other hand a slightly stuffier Roman would expect ___ad___ __ ___patriam___ , “to [your own] country.”

For verbs you could pick from ___redite___ _,_ literally “go back”; ___revertimini___ __ “turn back” or ___remigrate___  “go away back”; all of them work. ___Ite___ __ is literally “go” so it is the best literal translation of the English but it’s not very Roman-flavored; given the chance to bake the direction into the verbs (the ‘re-’ prefixes above) the Romans would probably do so.

So, any of these (the verbs could be swapped around)

___Romani redite domum! 
Romani revertimini ad patriam!
Romani remigrate domos!___
