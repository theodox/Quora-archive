Pilate is pretty well attested for a third tier Roman apparatchik.

Thereâ€™s a [contemporary inscription in his name](https://madainproject.com/pilate_stone), found in the Roman city of Caesarea Maritima:

_The second line of this inscription ( a temple dedication to the spirit of emperor Tiberius) is [PONT]IUS PILATU[S]. Photo:_ _[Madain Project](https://madainproject.com/pilate_stone)_ 

He is also mentioned briefly by the [Roman historian Tacitus](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D15%3Achapter%3D44) and the Jewish philosopher [Philo](http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book40.html) as an example of a Roman governor who disrespected Jewish sensibilities.
