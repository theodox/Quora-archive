# Corinthian helmets seem somewhat phallic. Was it intentional, or function over form?

Most Corinthian helmets included crests, which rather undermines the idea that symbolism was _universal_ . __note: NSFW ceramics below.__ 

That said, it would be entirely in character for the occasional Greek to commission a helmet with phallic symbolism in mind. It’s a commonplace among Classics scholars that his celebration of Athenian sea-power is also intended as a double-entendre:

And every public space in Athens had a few of these:

The connection with the second image might be part of the point — more than just a dirty joke or an assertion of male potency, phallic imagery was very commonly used as, essentially, a good-luck charm: a racier version of the four leaf clover or horse shoe ([this paper is Roman-centric ](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&context=uhf_2006)but many of the same concerns apply in earlier Greece). In this regard, a phallic helmet resembles the _[Gorgoneion](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-face-with-flowing-hair-which-can-be-seen-on-the-cuirasses-of-Alexander-the-Great-in-the-Alexander-Mosaic-and-the-bust-of-Scipio-Africanus/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=88b9a394&srid=zLvM)_ or medusa-head that was popular for breastplates or shields.

It’s worth pointing out that military equipment like this was expensive, and offered wealthy Greeks an opportunity to make an attention grabbing personal fashion statement. Alcibiades had an image of Eros holding a thunderbolt on his shield — a not-too-subtle reminder of his civilian… exploits… and also a rather heterodox appropriation of one of Zeus’ symbols to a less august deity.

Greek (and particularly Athenian) phallic imagery has been a fruitful jobs program for generations of gender-studies departments. There’s a very exhaustive if somewhat old-school Freudian treatment in Eva Keuls’ [Reign of the Phallus](https://amzn.to/2YKcPnM).

_PS: Here’s a very blatant example from a non-helmet context which makes me very, suspicious about the one particular piece referenced in the question._
