One very important reason that monasteries flourished in that period is that they were, effectively, immortal. 

During the years from, say, 500 to 1000 there were very few institutions that maintained an existence that outlasted their members. As urban life decayed, fewer and fewer institutions could survive beyond the lifespan of a powerful patron or perhaps the heyday of a wealthy family: you would be very unlikely to find, say, a commercial firm which lasted more than a couple of generations as families rose and fell. [Primogeniture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture) -- the practice of leaving an estate wholly to a single (male) heir to keep the family property together -- was not yet common; in many parts of Europe the practice was instead to divide properties equally; for example the [Salic law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salic_law#Some_tenets_of_the_law) encouraged divisions of large estates end even of entire kingdoms: The [Merovingian dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merovingian_dynasty) of Gaul dissolved this way in the 6th century, Charlemagne's kingdom was supposed to be divided the same way but two of his three heirs died before him (the 3-way division instead happened among his grandchildren). The net effect of this was a constant churn of power and influence as families rose and fell, estates dissolved and sometimes reformed. 

By contrast, the monasteries were permanent: they didn't divide their property as the generations passed on. They also acquired property from bequests -- leaving land to a monastery was good for the donor's soul (although that system did not really kick off into high gear until later -- the really flush period for those kind of donations was after the 13th century). All of which made the monasteries powerful landowners -- at least, so long as the local nobility didn't decide to expropriate them, which did happen from time to time. In this regard they were something like modern corporations, outliving any of their members and accumulating wealth over centuries rather than decades.

They were like corporations in another way as well. Unlike their feudal neighbors monasteries had the institutional patience and memory needed to make long term investments. Draining swamps, irrigating fields, improving domestic animals and even "industrial" investments in everything from wool-carding to the familiar breweries were important contributions made by monasteries to the rebuilding of Europe after the Roman collapse. Below is a reconstructed waterwheel from the [Cistercians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercians) abbey at Citeaux. This would have been rather later than the 'Dark Ages' - the abbey was founded around 1100 - but it's a good example of monastic technical achievements:

The biggest and most influential of the monastic groups in this period was the Benedictines, who placed a high value on the work: their motto was _ora et labora,_ "pray and work". In a society with hardly any commercial class, where the rulers lived by fighting and proved their status by conspicuous consumption, the combination of a long-term institutional view and a high value on work made the monasteries extremely important economic institutions. Jean Gimpel's picture of monastic 'factories' in [The medieval machine](http://www.scribd.com/doc/24916130/gimpel-the-medieval-machine-the-industrial-revolution-of-the-middle-ages#scribd) is a bit overblown but it does give a good corrective to the usual view that this was a period without either technical innovation or industrial development. 

Another monastic advantage, particularly before the 12th century, was in governance. Monasteries were run by abbots, but in most cases the abbots were chosen by the community; important decisions were taken in a community setting as well. With the strong communitarian ethic and also a high value on obedience as a virtue, this was not a freewheeling democracy -- but it was probably the most democratic institution in Europe at the time. Monasteries of course had higher literacy and far better access to books than was to be found elsewhere as well. All of this gave monasteries better governance than other institutions of the same period. 

Of course, all that economic success was not always good for the soul. Most monastic orders went through repeated cycles of growth and decay as their economic success tended to undermine the ascetic and spiritual purposes to which they were consecrated. A good example might be the abbey of [Cluny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluny_Abbey), which rose to prominence in the 10th century by championing a return to simplicity and social service when other monasteries had become lax and self indulgent. However the popularity of Cluny's revived brand of monasticism made the abbey the wealthiest in Europe: their Abbey was the largest building in Europe from about 1100 until the 16th century. Their zeal declined as their wealth increased -- by 1200 or so they themselves were the targets of reformers and satirists for their lush lives.
