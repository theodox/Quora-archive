Typically no .

The usual relationship is similar to the way a book publisher supports an author. The studio is paid an “advance” on expected revenues in order to fund development. The money is usually doled out in increments tied to specific development milestones, probably 4–6 times per year, When the game ships, the “advance” is paid back out of the profits — though the definition of “profit” is contentious because different publishers have different ways of accounting for things like marketing or tech support.

Most often the advance is charged against the profits at a premium, so that a $10m game budget might only pay off its advance when the game earns $15m. The amount of the premium depends on the nature of the deal and the negotiations between the publisher and the dev. After the advance is paid back the studio earns royalties on profits; the rate varies by deal but is usually in the range of 25%.

To the extent that this kind of deal involves “equity” it usually involves ownership of IP — it’s quite common for publishers to take ownership the IP of a game they finance as part of the deal. Most studios hate this, since IP ownership is one of the keys to financial stability — however a studio without a lot of money in the bank will often have to include the IP to get a deal at all. A lot of the appeal of platforms like Steam is that they typically don’t touch IP — on the other hand they also don’t usually provide development advances.

Equity-based deals do happen, but rarely on a project -by-project basis. Two big examples are Tencent’s shares in Riot Games and Epic. However these are not project-based deals: Both of these acquisitions reflect the fact that the studios had ongoing revenue streams rather than being tied to the typical product cycle — it’s much more like a traditional non-game equity deal than the production of a single game.

Another reason for equity deals is the desire to lock in a valued developer for a platform or publisher. The industry tends to cycle between times when lots of developers are “first party” — that is, owned by publishers or platform holders — and times when most devs are independent. The pendulum seems to be swinging back toward first party right now (my studio was acquired this summer, for example) but the cycle usually reverses itself about every 7–10 years. However the total number of theses kinds of deals is always fairly low, since the publishers rarely need

Some publishers have tried to go with a “finishing” model, where studios take a game to a fairly polished state on their own — without advances— and the publisher provides money for polish and marketing. In that version it’s up to the studio to find development funds, and some studios try to do that using VC money — which generally means equity. However there are not a lot of VCs who understand the games business and the risk/reward profile of most games is not that attractive compared to other tech businesses. So, that model has been tried but it’s still rare.

Tldr Games, like movies, are typically so risky that project-based financing rather than equity is the most common option. There are exceptions but they tend to be companies
