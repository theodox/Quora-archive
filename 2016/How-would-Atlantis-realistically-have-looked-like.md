Well, there are a lot of theories -- the most prominent of which is "there was no such place". 

 If you're looking for archaeology... well, there isn't any. If you're looking for graphic inspiration, here's a couple of ideas based on some of the possible candidates.

__Minoan Atlantis__ 

One theory is that "Atlantis" is a mythologized remembrance of the [destruction of the island of Thera](http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/civil/greece/gr1040e.shtml) in 1645BC. The volcanic eruption which destroyed the island played a major role in the downfall of the [Minoan Civilization,](http://www.ancient.eu/Minoan_Civilization/) based in Crete. If you go with this theory then here are some striking pieces of Minoan art and architecture that would be Atlantean:

 __Tartessian Atlantis__ 

Another [possible candidate ](http://www.science20.com/science_20/blog/lost_city_atlantis_found_spain-77166) for the 'real Atlantis' is the Spanish city of [Tartessos,](http://www.ancient.eu/tartessos/) which was a powerful and wealthy outpost in the Bronze Age but lost to history afterwards. It's believed to be sunken below the mouth of the Guadalqivir river. This means, unfortunately, that we don't have much art or architecture to go on. Here is a little of what we do have:

__Plato's Atlantis__ 

The classic sources for the legend of Atlantis are [two works by the Greek philosopher Plato.](http://www.activemind.com/Mysterious/topics/atlantis/timaeus_and_critias.html) Most modern scholars think he either invented the story wholesale, or, more likely, used a vague existing myth as a useful fictional setting for his ideal state. The description he gives is mostly about the arrangement of the city (not the art and architecture) but it's a circular plan more or less like this:

There's plenty of more candidates too: the [Mayans](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maria-popova/abstracting-atlantis-scie_b_589049.html), the [Indonesians](http://atlantipedia.ie/samples/natawidjaja-danny-hilman-n/), the [Jordanians](http://abcnews.go.com/International/atlantis-sand-unlocking-mysteries-petra/story?id=17520115), the [Irish](http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread686129/pg1)... it's a subject with a lot of creative freedom, if not much hard evidence to work with.
