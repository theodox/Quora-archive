Herodotus tells the story of how seven Persian nobleman overthrew an imposter, who had taken control of the Persian empire by pretending to be [Smerdis](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/gaumata-smerdis/), heir to the Persian throne. The seven noblemen saw through the imposture and killed the usurper, but had to decide on what to do next. He records a debate — which sounds an awful lot more like a bunch of Greek philosophers than a bunch of Persian warrior aristocrats, but which he is adamant actually happened — in which they considered the merits of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, ending in the decision that only a monarch could rule such a large empire effectively.

However, they could not agree on who would be king. One of the seven removed himself from consideration, on the promise that whoever won the crown would respect his and his family’s independence. The other six were to submit to the arbitration of fate:

> … they took a counsel of this sort: whosoever’s horse at the sun’s rising was first to make a sound when they rode out of the city after they had mounted, that one should have the kingdom.

However (according to Herodotus)[ it wasn’t fate that made the decision at all](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D84%3Asection%3D2):

> Now Darius had a clever groom, whose name was Oebares. When the council broke up, Darius said to him: “Oebares, we have resolved to do as follows about the kingship: he shall be elected whose horse, after we are all mounted on our horses in the suburb of the city, neighs first at sunrise. Now if you have any cunning, figure out how we and no one else can win this prize.”

> “Master,” Oebares answered, “if this is to determine whether you become king or not, be confident for this reason and have an easy mind, for no one else shall be king before you, such are the tricks I have.” “Then,” said Darius, “if you have any trick such as you say, use it and don't put it off, for tomorrow is the day of decision.”

> When Oebares heard that, he did as follows. At nightfall he brought one of the mares which Darius' horse particularly favored, and tethered her in the suburb of the city; then bringing Darius' horse, he repeatedly led him near the horse, bumping against the mare, and at last let the horse mount.

> At dawn of day the six came on horseback as they had agreed. As they rode out through the suburb and came to the place where the mare had been tethered in the past night, Darius' horse trotted forward and whinnied; and as he so did there came lightning and thunder out of a clear sky. These signs given to Darius were thought to be foreordained and made his election perfect; his companions leapt from their horses and bowed to him.

> Some say that this was Oebares' plan; but there is another story in [Persia](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/entityvote?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=3:chapter=87:section=1&auth=tgn,7000231&n=1&type=place) besides this: that he rubbed this mare's vulva with his hand, which he then kept inside his clothing until the six were about to let go their horses at sunrise, when he took his hand out and held it to the nostrils of Darius' horse, which at once snorted and whinnied.

> So Darius son of Hystaspes was made king…

> He also married a daughter of Cyrus' son Smerdis, whose name was Parmys, and the daughter of Otanes who had discovered the truth about the Magus; and everything was full of his power. First he made and set up a carved stone, upon which was cut the figure of a horseman, with this inscription: “Darius son of Hystaspes, aided by the excellence of his horse” (here followed the horse's name) “and of Oebares his groom, got possession of the kingdom of Persia

While this sounds like a complete fairytale, it seems like it’s a Persian rather than a Greek one (you’ll notice that Herodotus provides two different versions of the trick itself). Its sometimes thought that the story is a garbled version of a ritual confirmation of the change of rulership — the Persians, after all, were originally horse-nomads. The [seven nobles are historical figures, and they really did overthrow Smerdis](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/darius-the-great/5-civil-war/); [Darius did actually put up a number of inscriptions](http://www.livius.org/articles/place/behistun/) detailing his victory over what he called “the lie” — that is, over the usurper. Modern scholars, however, wonder if that’s just Darius covering his own rebellion against the legitimate king…

However it’s not surprising if Persians themselves didn’t get the story altogether straight — the inscriptions were written in a newly-invented version cuneiform which almost no one in Persia could actually read.
