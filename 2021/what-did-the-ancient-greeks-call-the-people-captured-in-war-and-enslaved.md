The most literal terms were αἰχμάλωτος, _aichmalōtos_ and δορυάλωτος, _doryalōtos, “spear-point-taken” and “spear-taken” respectively._ Strictly speaking these could be used for prisoners of war who were not necessarily enslaved: a high-ranking captive who might be ransomed was an _aichmalōtos_ but not a slave until his captor decided that no one would be willing or able to redeem the him.

The most chilling term was ᾰ̓νδρᾰ́ποδον, _andrapodon,_ “a man-footed beast” — it seems to be a grim pun on _τετραποδον_ , _tetrapodon:_ the generic word for livestock, literally “four-footed-beast.” This originally occurred mostly in the plural , describing slaves as one aspect of the booty taken in a successful campaign: it’s the most businesslike and dehumanizing way of describing humans as property. Eventually however it became a non-specific term for slaves in general, though it always remained connected to their status as property (for example, if you purchased a workshop along with its enslaved workers, they were the _andropoda_  of the sale).

To illustrate the difference in both legal and emotional terms, [Plutarch tells a traditional story](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0195%3Astephpage%3D233c) of a captured Spartan on the auction block:

> Λάκων αἰχμαλωτισθεὶς καὶ πιπρασκόμενος, τοῦ κήρυκος λέγοντος, ‘Λάκωνα πωλῶ,’ ἐπεστόμισεν εἰπών, ‘αἰχμάλωτον κήρυσσε.’

> A Spartan was captured (_aichmalotistheis)._  When he was being sold and the barker announced “I will sell [this] Spartan,” he stopped him, saying, “announce [me as] ‘Spear-taken’”
