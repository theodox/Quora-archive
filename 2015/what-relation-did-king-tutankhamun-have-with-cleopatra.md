Zero. 

Tut lived about 1,300 years before Cleopatra. He was a native Egyptian of the [Eighteenth Dynasty, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt)which ended with him or his successor [Ay ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ay)around 1320 BC.

[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt)Cleopatra wasn't a native Egyptian at all, her family (the [Ptolemaic dynasty ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty)) were [Macedonians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Macedonians)who came to Egypt in the army of Alexander the Great. Alexander conquered Egypt in 332 BC -- although he didn't take it from the Egyptians: he defeated the Persians who had been ruling Egypt since 525 BC. 

Between Tut and the Persians were twelve other dynasties (not exactly the same thing as royal families, but close). During that 8o0 or so year span, Egypt fell apart a couple of times, was conquered by the [Kushites ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt)from Nubia and the also occupied by the [Libu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libu) from Libya. 

In short, a lot of history comes between Tut and Cleopatra. About all they really have in common besides Egypt is the fact that both are household names today.
