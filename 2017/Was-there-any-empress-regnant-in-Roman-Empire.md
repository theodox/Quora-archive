In the _Eastern_ Roman Empire, aka “Byzantium”, [Irene of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_of_Athens) ruled in her own right, more or less, from 797 to 802. Opposition to the idea of a reigning empress helped lay the groundwork for Charlemagne’s adoption of the title Emperor in 800. The failure of Irene’s plan to marry Charlemagne and reunite the two halves of the empire failed is one of the great what-if’s of history.

_hat tip to_ _[Lajos Dezsi](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lajos-Dezsi)_ _for catching the wrong Irene - if you image-google “Irene of Athens” most of the top hits are actually Irene of Hungary!_ 

[Zoë Porphyrogenita ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo%C3%AB_Porphyrogenita)and [Theodora Porphyrogenita,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodora_Porphyrogenita_(11th_century)) who were sisters, reigned together briefly in 1042, and Theodora came out of retirement to reign alone in 1055–6.

That was a a horrible Byzantine reality TV show.

The sisters hated each other (Zoe was the pretty one, Theodora the smart one). When Zoe became empress — marying Romanos III in 1028 — she forced her sister into exile in a convent. However Zoe’s marriage was unhappy and she (allegedly, anyway) had Romanos murdered and then married her lover Michael IV — who repaid the favor by removing her from politics and keeping her confined to the palace women’s quarters. She, was eventually banished to a convent by her (unwillingly) adopted son Michael V. However this outrage to the dynasty was unpopular with ordinary Constantinopolitans that she was rescued from the convent along with her sister in 1042 and for two months they ruled together with Theodora (the smart one, recall) being the more important influential of the two.

So, Zoe married again, this time to Constantine IX — so now there was one emperor and two empresses. Theodora receded into the background while Constantine lived (with his mistresss, incidentally) but when Constantine lay dying she emerged from the convent yet again and took the reigns of power once more at age 75. She reigned as sole empress again from 1055 to 1066.
