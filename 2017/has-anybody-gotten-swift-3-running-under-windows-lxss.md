Answering my own question: [Install Apple Swift 3.0 on Windows 10 Anniversary Update [using ubuntu bash]](http://www.developerinsider.in/install-apple-swift-3-0-on-windows-10-anniversary-update/)

TLDR â€” it sort of works; you can compile and run a simple CLI app. However the REPL still does not work.
