That’s the story, anyway. It was already circulating within living memory of his lifetime, and Polybius actually ascribes it directly to Hannibal. At 3.11 he describes Hannibal justifying his attitude to king Antiochus of Syria, whom he was staying with and with whom he advocated an anti-Roman policy

> He said that at the time when his father was about to start with his army on his expedition to Spain, he himself, then nine years of age, was standing by the altar, while Hamilcar was sacrificing to Zeus. When, on the omens being favourable, Hamilcar had poured a libation to the gods and performed all the customary rites, he ordered the others who were attending the sacrifice to withdraw to a slight distance and calling Hannibal to him asked him kindly if he wished to accompany him on the expedition. On his accepting with delight, and, like a boy, even begging to do it besides, his father took him by the hand, led him up to the altar, and bade him lay his hand on the victim and swear never to be the friend of the Romans. He begged Antiochus, then, now he knew this for a fact, as long as his intentions were hostile to Rome, to rely on him confidently and believe that he would have in him his sincerest supporter, but from the moment he made peace and alliance with her he had no need to wait for accusations but should mistrust and beware of him; for there was nothing he would not do against the Romans.

Much later Livy gives substantially the same story, but with somewhat stronger wording. That’s the version that became popular with the Latin-speaking world.
