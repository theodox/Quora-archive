As the other answers note it’s primarily the _Greeks_  not the Romans who favored nude statuary. Roman art picked up the habit from the Greeks a good bit of the time, but usually tended to a more covered-up appearance (particularly when the subjects were people of importance in the Roman world: emperors rarely showed up in nude statues,[ though there are exceptions to that rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebonianus_Gallus)). So, this answer covers Greeks, not Romans except by extension.

Most ancient societies had some kind of nudity taboo; the Greeks were fairly unusual in their fondness for public nudity. Nude statues were one of the first big departures which Greek artists made from their Egyptian predecessors — Greeks learned freestanding sculpture from Egypt, and pretty much the first thing they dropped was the trousers (or more precisely the kilts):

_The influence of Egyptian statuary on early Greek work is obvious. So is the disappearance of clothes._ 

There’s not a single explanation for the Greek embrace of nudity. It was definitely a unique cultural trait: most other cultures in the region regarded nudity as a sign of low status. in Egypt, nudes are usually slaves:

In Mesopotamia, depictions of naked bodies are limited almost exclusively to images of corpses on the battlefield.

_Nudes in Assyrian art are usually war dead or prisoners._ 

Egyptian statues reflect the stiff, hierarchical nature of the Egyptian theocracy. Greek statues reflect the values of the Greek aristocracy, for whom athleticism and physical beauty were key ideals (the Greek phrase for ‘gentleman” is _kalos k’agathos_ , “_beautiful_ and good”). The nude young men or [Kouroi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouros) who dominate early Greek sculpture are clearly high-status individuals —they use poses deliberately copied from Egyptian pharoahs and gods. But they adopt the characteristic Greek undress. Greek aristocrats revelled in public nudity: the gymnasium, where young men practiced running, wrestled, and trained for war was basically all-nude — and it was also the equivalent of a country club, open only to aristocrats.

Exactly why and how the Greek became such ardent naturists is a whole different question. Maybe its the climate; maybe its connected to [Greek pederasty](https://www.quora.com/Did-Ancient-Greek-men-have-affairs-with-young-men) (female nudes don’t appear in Greek art until some centuries later), maybe its a nod to an early era in Greek history when clothing was really expensive. It might have been military machismo (in better documented times, [some warriors in Gaul and Germany fought naked](https://history.stackexchange.com/a/7394/5239) as a show of bravado and contempt for their enemies).

_This 5th century example is already pretty far from the stiff Egyptianate pose of the example above_

_Another century and we’re in recognizably “classical” territory — but this is all an evolution of those Egyptian originals (note the traditional foot placement on the left)._ 

In short, we have a lot of theories but we don’t have a definitive answer. What we do know is that Greek statuary reflects the Greek attitude about nudity — particularly aristocratic male nudity. That early tradition of nude statuary was enshrined in the Greek artistic canon as lastingly as the stiff poses and animal-headed features of Egyptian art.
