No. There were plenty of individual Italians — primarily the leaders of allied cities and soldiers who had served with Romans against Hannibal — who did get citizenship. However at that point in time Rome and the Italians both tended to views what we called “Roman” Italy as an alliance system rather than an empire. Rome certainly enjoyed a dominant position — more like Moscow in the Warsaw Pact than Washington in NATO — but for the most part the belief on both sides was that most Italian cities were “independent” “allies” rather than conquered territories ruled by Romans.

With the benefit of hindsight we can say that this view was, at best, rather outdated by 202: Rome’s outsized access to the fruits of victory, its access to overseas territories that were not part of the Italian alliance network, and the vastly greater opportunities that the Roman elite had for winning fame and wealth all made rendered the basic inequality of the system increasingly obvious. Eventually this metastasized into the [Social War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_War_(91–87_BC)) (91–87 BC)— a war which pitted Rome against it’s allies, in Latin, the _socii._ This began as an effort to force the Romans to grant citizenship to all of their Italian allies, but many of the rebel leaders flirted with the idea of throwing off Roman domination altogether. It combined aspects of an anti-imperial rebellion and of a civil war.

After four years of fighting — some if it quite intense, since the armies of both sides were for the most part armed, trained and led the same way — the Romans put down the independentist strain among the allies but the post-war settlement extended Roman citizenship first to the allies who had stayed loyal during the social war and shortly thereafter to the rest of Italy south of Cisalpine Gaul (which in those days was not “Italy”). Some echoes of the independentist movement could be seen in the ways fault lines that divided Italy during the civil wars of Marius and Sulla during the following decade — but effectively it was the Social War which made all of Italy “Roman”.
