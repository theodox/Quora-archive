It's a means of restricting the effect of some lights to some objects. This can be useful for a number of reasons, ranging from adding emphasis to a particular object (the same way a cinematographer might add unmotivated lights highlighting a character, for example) to speeding up render times by, say, excluding distant objects from an expensive render pass with shadows and reflections.
