# I'm 16, is it too late to start learning 3D animation? And how can I do it if I have a low end computer?

Definitely not too late! Plenty of people don’t start until college years, or even later — transitioning across from other graphics fields, like illustration or architecture, is very common.

A better computer will _help_ , but it’s not a requirement. 3dS Max and Maya have not really changed all that much in the 20 years since they were first designed, and should be serviceable on most modern computers. RAM is the biggest obstacle, working with less than 4 GB of ram will be pretty frustrating. A gaming video card is usually enough (Autodesk likes to pretend you need a $2000 workstation card to use their software — it’s not true at all, even a moderately good gaming card will be fine).

If you are strapped for money, start with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), which is free and has low minimum specs;

32-bit dual core 2Ghz CPU with SSE2 support.

2 GB RAM.

24 bits 1280×768 display

OpenGL 2.1 compatible graphics with 512 MB RAM.

There is a lot of free learning material on the web for learning animation and blender in particular.

If there is a location near you, [iD Tech Camps](https://www.idtech.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5ee-n9iy2QIVh4F-Ch1jCgSgEAAYASAAEgKwEvD_BwE) usually offer summer classes in Maya. These are expensive (about $900) but you can get a student copy of Maya if you take their course.
