For the most part, Italians after 1494 were more likely to be colonized than colonizers.

Venice actually did have an overseas empire in the eastern Mediterranean, which hung on into the 18th century. Most of this was maintained through intermittent wars against the Ottomans; eventually the much-diminished Venetian empire was divvied up by Napoleon and the Austrians in 1797.

Venice was an exception. For the most part, there’s an almost precise synchronism between the beginning of the age of overseas European expansion and the subjugation of Italy by outside powers. Despite their wealth and commercial prowess, the Italian states were completely outclassed by the military resources of larger states: Spain, France and the Holy Roman Empire under the Hapsburgs. This became painfully obvious with the onset of the [Italian Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Wars) — a series of conflicts which began in 1494 and lasted for two generations, ending in the mid 16th century with Italy divided mostly between direct or indirect dependencies of Spain (in the south) or the empire (in the north), with the Papal states as an informal buffer between them.

After about 1560, some smaller states continued to exist — but largely on the sufferance of the larger powers. Apart from Venice, however, none of the surviving states had the ability to project power outside their own regions. Independent city-states could not hope to match the resources of large territorial kingdoms. Regional states absorbed may formerly independent cities and — after a long period of bitter warfare and political disunion— these regional powers tended to became more despotic and hierarchical. Italian scholars often refer to the result of the wars as _rifeudalizzazione,_ “re-feudalisation.” A handful of city-state republics (Venice, Genoa, Lucca, tiny San Marino) survived — but none were remotely as influential as their late-Medieval predecessors had been. This era produced some remarkable art and music, but not a lot of political or commercial dynamism. For most of the period between 1494 and 1870 Italian politics was more concerned with efforts — largely unsuccessful — to avoid domination by other European powers rather than attempts to impose itself on others.

The great go-to book on this era in larger context (not just the ups-and-downs of dynastic warfare) remains’ Fernand Braudel’s ___The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II___
