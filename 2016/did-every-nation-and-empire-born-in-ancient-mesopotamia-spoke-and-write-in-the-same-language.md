No, there were quite a few different languages, including some interesting outliers which don’t belong to the big familiar families. However before Persian times most writing was done in the same [cuneiform writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_script), so much of the surviving materials _looks_  like its one language. Mesopotamian history is long — from the settlement of Sumer to the Persian conquest is about as long as from the Persian conquest until today — so there’s a lot of complexity and diversity there. Plus, Mesopotamia is not good terrain for defense, so it always was a patchwork of peoples and languages.

The list of languages is quite long but here’s the main ones:

__[Sumerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language)__ ____ is a unique language with no obvious modern relatives. Sumerians invented the cuneiform writing system — Sumerian and Egyptian vie for the title of ‘oldest written language’. Later cultures who adopted it usually retained some Sumerian words for religious or legal purposes. We know a surprising amount about the language thanks to dictionaries and translations in later languages.

__[Elamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language)__ isn’t exactly Mesopotamian — it’s the language on the mountain peoples of what now Iran, perennial enemies of Sumeria, Babylon and Assyria. It’s another very obscure language; some people think it’s related to the languages of the Indus Valley civilization but we can’t read it yet so we don’t really know.

__[Akkadian](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/akkadian.htm)__ is a Semitic language, distantly related to Arabic, Hebrew and Ethiopian languages like Amharic. It was the language of the empire of [Sargon](http://www.ancient.eu/Sargon_of_Akkad/), so it spread widely for trade and diplomacy even in areas where different languages were spoken day-to-day. Assyrian and Babylonian are different enough to be regarded as different languages, but both offshoots of Akkadian. Most of the other languages on this list co-existed with Akkadian which remained a prestige language for two millennia.

Eventually Akkadian was replaced by __[Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_language)__ as the common language of the region. Aramaic is another Semitic language, but one much more closely related to Hebrew and Arabic. Aramaic was written in an alphabetic script, not cuneiform tablets, which is one of the reasons it spread — it was far easier to read and write. Living descendants of Aramaic are still spoken across the region, particularly by the Assyrian minority in Iraq.

Some other, more obscure languages:

[Hurrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurrian_language) and [Urartian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urartian_language) are related to each other and possibly to modern Armenian. They were spoken in northern Mesopotamia and in modern Syria, Turkey and Armenia.

[Mitanni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitanni) is an Indo-European language, distantly related to Greek, Sanskrit and Persian. It was the language of a short-lived but powerful empire in northwestern Mesopotamia and Syria.

[Gutian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutian_people) was looked down on as a ‘barbarian’ language —it’s probably Indo-European but it survives only in names and titles; the Gutians relied on Akkadian scribes for their own record keeping.
