Yep. It's FOSS "Free and Open Source Software" so you can use if for free and even make your own version using the Blender source code. It's a great bargain at that price -- a very capable program. 

 It does have he classic open source problem with UI: distributed communities tend not to be as good at this aspect of software are smaller, focused teams with marketing and usability research people holding their noses to the fire. OS projects tend to have great innards -- they attract a high class of motivated developers -- and overly complex front ends. However there are already variants like [Dark Blender](http://www.blendernation.com/2015/10/16/55622/) aimed at customizing the UI and workflow for specific tasks.
