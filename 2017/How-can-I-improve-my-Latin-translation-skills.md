One thing that I’ve found very useful is to listen to spoken Latin — even though my comprehension is not fast enough to keep up for extended periods I’m quite sure it has helped me internalize some of the routine aspects of grammar and it forces me to pay attention to sentences as a whole instead of falling back on one-word-at-a-time translation.

There’s a great resource for Latin audio at [Latinum](https://www.patreon.com/latinum/posts), with a variety of texts — some bilingual and some Latin only — at different levels of complexity and consistent pronunciation. Definitely worth a try.

There are also online Latin forums at [Textkit ](http://www.textkit.com/greek-latin-forum/)and [Latin Discussion](http://latindiscussion.com/forum/) — a good place to ask technical questions or get critiques on your renderings.

The [SPQR Latin Dictionary and Reader](http://romansgohome.com/spqr) app is a great way to do some practice on the bus or over lunch hour - it’s go a bunch of Latin texts (and a few with English so you can check yourself), linked vocabulary and grammar reference.

As far as books go, I’ve gotten a lot of value out of going “backwards” - checking out learning material that’s not as advanced as my theoretical limit. Being able to breeze through something fairly straightforward is good for confidence but it also helps you recognize common forms and constructions and file them away for later — it’s good for clearing out the underbrush and getting you to focus on the hard parts. [Latin Via Ovid](https://www.amazon.com/Latin-Via-Ovid-Course-Second/dp/0814317324/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=87GV0V67YH8VCFXSP839) is pretty good for easy reading material with attached vocabulary and notes.

On the more theoretical level, [Ossa Latinitatis Sola](https://www.amazon.com/Ossa-Latinitatis-Sola-Foster/dp/0813228328/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_3?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0813228328&pd_rd_r=K29FWZEKR44S4KAFF3QA&pd_rd_w=dScLV&pd_rd_wg=c6h7B&psc=1&refRID=K29FWZEKR44S4KAFF3QA) is an interesting and opinionated take on the language as a whole, more about the feel and texture than about memorizing tables of endings.
