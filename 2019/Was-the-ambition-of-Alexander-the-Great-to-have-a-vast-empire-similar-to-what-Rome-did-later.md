Generally not. On some basic level, of course, imperialism is always knocking people on the head and taking their stuff, and from that perspective Romans and Alexander would have a lot of basic similarities.

For any more nuanced level, however, there’s a really critical difference. It took about six hundred years for Rome to reach its maximum territorial extent (in 117 AD). Alexander assembled his entire empire before he turned 33.

Rome certainly produced a few character’s who had similarly swashbuckling ambitions. Caesar is the most obvious example, but hardly the only one. However even the most grandiose Roman operated in a very different context.

Alexander was an absolute monarch — a very successful and charismatic one, to boot. He could dare anything he chose, at least as long as he could bamboozle his army into following him. The stopper on his conquests wasn’t an enemy army or a change in policy — it was simply that his troops were footsore and homesick and didn’t want to keep going. If you can believe Plutarch, anyway, Alexander would have kept on going till he found the rising sun.

A Roman general, by contrast, was heavily hemmed in by the fundamental design of Roman society, For almost five hundred years Roman politics was designed expressly to prevent anyone from becoming as omnipotent as Alexander.

Military glory was critical to any would be Roman politician — but only as a stepping stone to what really mattered: political authority among his peers back home. Campaigning in the far off wilderness was a tool, not an end it itself. The system eventually broke down in the last century of the Republic, when the profits of conquest unbalanced the domestic political scene. Individual generals (like Marius, Sulla, Pompey and Caesar) became so powerful that they eclipsed the Roman state. But even Caesar could not really do anything that took his fancy: the ancient Roman urge to keep individual power in check died hard. Caesar was making plans to sail off and conquer the east when he was killed by the last heirs of Roman collectivism.

After the Republic was dismembered, Caesar’s successors had power which was vastly greater than Alexander’s. Not only did they field armies which dwarfed his forces, they also exercised far more detailed control over the regions they ruled (they had, after all, centuries in which to evolve mechanisms of political control and integration: Alexander had a decade).

However that power came at a price: realism.

The empire endured precisely because it demanded a lot of work, from the maintenance of the peace to the building of roads to the gradual assimilation of conquered peoples. Thus, no Roman emperor could afford to set off for the far horizons in search of adventure: who’d be minding the store? The greatest conqueror among the emperors was [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan), who advanced the Roman eagles deep into the Balkans and to Babylon. However his immediate successor voluntarily returned most of the eastern conquests to the Parthians: it was both safer and more profitable to rest on a defensible frontier rather than to pursue conquest for its own sake. Once Rome was the most prosperous civilization in its part of the world, the incentive for conquest declined: why spend money and treasure to rob those poorer than yourself?

So: no, Roman imperialism and Alexander’s adventures were quite different things. In a militaristic age, Alexander’s aura of military glamour was very influential in Rome. More than a couple of emperors visited his tomb: Caligula stole his breastplate, and Caracalla stole his belt. But even when they dreamed of being Alexander, the Roman emperors were stuck with a more prosaic and bureaucratic existence.
