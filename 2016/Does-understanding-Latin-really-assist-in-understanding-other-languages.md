Well, Latin _vocabulary_  is extremely useful in dealing with Romance languages, since it's so commonly recycled in a variety of contexts. That sentence, for example includes _extremely_  (from _extremus_ ), _language (_ from _lingua_ via the French _langue_ ), vocabulary (_vocabulum)_  and _context_ (_contextus)._ I didn't make a special effort to pick a Latin-heavy opener either, it was pure accident.

Latin _grammar_  is handy if you come from a language thats primarily positional, like English, but need to grasp what the heck is going on in languages that rely heavily on inflection, like German or Russian.

In general , though, the act of learning a new language from scratch - especially a 'dead' language where you need to learn in a very analytical way instead of picking up conversational skills - is excellent training in the art of seeing commonalities and differences in all languages.
