Two things:

As [User](https://www.quora.com/profile/User-397463) points out, _Romanorum_ ("of the Romans") is more idiomatic than the adjective _Romanus._ 

_Exercitus_  is the usual modern translation for 'army', but the modern word doesn't map neatly onto to the way the Romans would speak; our word focuses on the institution of the armed forces, where as Romans would more commonly talk about the concrete tactical formation, the legion, the _legio (_ plural_legiones)._ In a more general context, _arma_  or "arms" would express the idea of 'military power' -- something like where we would say 'forces'.
