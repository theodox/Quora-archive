When the Bible was translated into Latin the translators didn’t try to translate יְהֹוָה. The Greek Septuagint left the Hebrew characters (without vowels) so it was unpronounceable — St. Jerome remarks in passing that some ignorant people read the 4 letters as if they were Greek πιπι, “pipi.”

The approximation that outsiders used was some variation on Ιαω, which is not easily pronuncible in Greek but it’s the one that, for example [Diodorus Siculus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1D*.html) quotes. Other variants included ιαουε, ιαουαι, and ιαβε.

The [vetus latina](http://www.vetuslatina.org/), which was translated mostly from the Greek Septuagint, and the [Vulgate](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/vul/) both followed the Jewish practice of not speaking or writing the name aloud and replaced it with _dominus_ , “lord.” Jerome (who unlike many of his Latin contemporaries actually knew Hebrew) transliterates it __IAHO__ , but also calls it _ineffabilis,_ “unutterable.”

___Jehova___ _doesn’t show up in Latin until the 13th century. The author was a Catalan monk, so it would have been pretty close to “he-o-wa” in his ear, with no hard J._ 

People debate endlessly between _Yeshua, Yeshu, Yashua,_  _Yehoshua_ and other variants. I’m not equipped (or foolhardy enough) to get into that one. If you buy the identification of “Jesus” with the Hebrew name we usually anglicise as Joshua, it Latinises as __Iosue__ _._ If you don’t, the standard Greek transliteration of Jesus’ name is _Ιησος,_ which becomes Latin __Iesus__ . You’ll note that neither the Greek or Latin speakers had a good way of dealing with the sound we write as _-sh-._
