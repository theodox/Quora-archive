# In the book Guns, Germs and Steel, the author points out indigenous people didn't domesticate resources and spent their time on the hunt, which could be a reason why they had little invention. What does that imply of their women who didn't hunt?

The most common setup for non-agricultural peoples is a combination of hunting and 'gathering' : collecting things like nuts, roots and berries which are an important part of the diet even for people who don't do settled farming. In most cases men handle the "hunting" and women the "gathering," but the details vary a lot from one people to another and the line between the two is pretty fuzzy in any case: fishing, collecting shellfish or picking snails don't have the same athletic requirements as, say, tracking a deer.

 The division of labor between the sexes has a lot to do with the local environment -- without advanced tools, the "performance characteristics" of the hunter or gatherer matter a lot more than they do in our lives. However if the environment doesn't offer the kind of game where speed and strength are key advantages, there's much less reason to divide the work along gender (or age) lines.

Both hunting and gathering also require a lot of prep work. Hunters need weapons; collectors need baskets or satchels and tools; everybody needs clothes and a way to carry water. In most small societies people make their own personal tools and supplies instead of handing off the labor to specialists, but there are lots of exceptions to that rule. This does tend to encourage a sexual division of labor (men making spears and women making baskets) for example since the techniques and tools are passed down by the people doing the work. It's worth remembering that without writing or schools, learning a craft like creating an axe from a random stone or weaving a basket takes a long time to master. 

 It's usually believed that agriculture evolved from people realizing that some kinds of gathering were more predictable than others -- you could make sure that there would be berries or edible grasses next year by spreading seeds in good locations. Once people realized that it wasn't hard to figure out that you could create favorable conditions by clearing fields, providing water, and fertilizing. It is supposed that women were the prime innovators in moving from simple gathering to planting and harvesting, since farming evolved out of gathering -- though of course this is a guess on our part. Animal domestication probably evolved out of hunting in a similar fashion. 
Both farming and herding are really complex webs of technologies -- we take them for granted today because they've spread so widely, but creating them from scratch was a huge, multi-generational effort. Nothing that came afterwards -- from building cities to building space stations -- is possible without the stability and extra food that comes from domesticated plants and animals.
