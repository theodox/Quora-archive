Yes, plenty of them. And quite a few switched sides at different times.

It’s important to remember that the time between the first serious Greek-Roman conflict and Rome’s final absorption of the main Greek states* is two and a half centuries (counting from the war against Pyrrhus in 280 BC to the final defeat of Cleopatra in Egypt in 31 BC). During the last half of that time period Rome was definitely the dominant power in the Mediterranean, but during the first half it was one among many and not the richest or most feared.

The main Greek states were always mutually suspicious, constantly plotting against each other and pulling any allies they could find into their conflicts (in addition to the Romans, they enlisted Gauls, Thracians, Scythians and a number of other “barbarian” foreigners in their conflicts). They also had non-Greek enemies from whom they sought protection. So there were plenty of reasons for Greeks to seek Roman assistance. The [first major Roman-Greek war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_War) was a Roman intervention on behalf of one set of Greeks against another — that pattern persisted for the next two and a half centuries. _All_ of the major Greek powers were Roman allies at one point or another. Every one of the key battles that established Roman power in the Greek world — [Magnesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Magnesia), [Cynoscephalae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cynoscephalae), and [Pydna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pydna) — saw Greek troops fighting on the Roman side. Ironically, the close of the period saw the opposite case: When Octavian conquered Egypt, there were Romans fighting on both sides.

The usual pattern of Greek politics was one of constantly fluctuating alliances — the goal for most Greek states was to prevent any of the others from achieving dominance. This meant that relationships were constantly realigned as different powers advanced and retreated: treaties and alliances were always temporary. Greeks saw their relations with Rome as part of the same pattern — but the Roman attitude was diametrically opposite. Romans were extremely insistent on the permanence of treaty relations, so they tended to react fiercely when a Greek state followed the traditional pattern of shifting alliances: the [most violent episode in the whole Greek-Roman conflict was the destruction of Corinth in 146](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Rome-destroy-Carthage/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=0f393c30&srid=zLvM), which was driven by Roman fury at the defection of their former allies, the [Achaean League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaean_League).



* side note: By the time the Romans showed up, most of the Greek world was organized into large kingdoms. Even smaller powers like Rhodes or Pergamon, which were nominally city-states, were really territorial states by this time ruling over other cities.
