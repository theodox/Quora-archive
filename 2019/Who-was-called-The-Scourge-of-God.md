That was [Attila the Hun](https://www.ancient.eu/Attila_the_Hun/). It’s not obvious where he got the nickname: the closest description to his time was

> He was a man born into the world to shake the nations, the scourge of all lands, who in some way terrified all mankind by the dreadful rumors noised abroad concerning him. ‘

from the the East Roman historian [Jordanes](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/jordanes-attila.asp), probably based on the earlier [Priscus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priscus), who visited Attila his court.

The actual “Scourge of God” tag was in use by the Renaissance era.
