I suspect this has to go with history. C4d is much more popular in Europe than in North America or Japan, so companies elsewhere are unlikely to have a large cadre of trained users to work with.

Inside of Europe there are plenty of people familiar with Max and Maya, so even there it's not a compelling choice. Creating a game pipeline from scratch has is a large undertaking, so companies tend to play it conservativelyâ€” adopting a tool with a small user base makes it hard to get maintain your shop (this is exactly what happened to Softimage XSI, an excellent package that could never break out of the chicken-and-egg cycle to gain market share). If you need trained users or off-the-shelf solutions for your pipeline it's just easier to find them for the big products.

This effect is less pronounced in vfx and tv production where the integration costs are less of an issue, so C4d does relatively better there. I'm not sure about film but I think the vertical integration problems are even stronger there than in games.
