The standard textbook was __[Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice](https://amzn.to/2DbQqDO)__ — better known as “Foley and Van Dam”, after the two principal authors — for pretty much anybody in the field back then. This was the current one at the time

In 94 a less hefty version by the same authors came out as __[Introduction to Computer Graphics](https://amzn.to/2GpjECl)__ __.__ Both books are still in print, though they’ve been updated since then.

“Trending,” however, had not yet been invented.
