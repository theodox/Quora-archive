# Did any Thessalians help their fellow Greeks during the Persian invasions? I am aware of the Aleuadae collaboration. I'm just wondering if any cities resisted and how?

After some initial hesitation, the Thessalians became enthusiastic allies of Xerxes.

Herdotus (VII 172–174) says that at first, most of the Thessalians had no taste for the tyrants’ flirtation with Xerxes:

> The Thessalians had at first taken the Persian part not willingly but of necessity, as their acts showed, because they misliked the devices of the Aleuadae. For as soon as they heard that the Persian was about to cross over into Europe, they sent messengers to the Isthmus, where were assembled in council for the Greek cause men chosen from the cities that had the best will towards Hellas.γ To these the Thessalian messengers came, and said, "Men of Hellas, the pass of Olympus must be guarded, that Thessaly and all Hellas may be sheltered from the war. Now we are ready to guard it with you; but you too must send a great force; if you will not send it, be assured that we shall make terms with the Persian; for it is not right that we should be left to stand alone for an outpost of Hellas and so perish for your sakes. If you will not send help, there is no constraint that you can put upon us; for no necessity can prevail over lack of ability. As for us, we will essay for ourselves to find some way of deliverance." Thus spoke the men of Thessaly.

The Greek commanders responded: they sent 10,000 hoplites to the pass of Tempe where they were joined by Thessalian cavalry.

However they had not been there long before Alexander of Macedon (who was quite at home playing both sides of the fence during the entire war) sent his own messengers, warning of the size of Xerxes army. News also came (Herodotus’ telling doesn’t make it clear if this news came from Alexander or another source) that the Persians knew about an alternate pass at [Gonnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonnus) which would allow the Great King to flank the Greek position at Tempe.

So, the Greek force withdrew and the Thessalians — seeing which way the wind was blowing — threw in their lot with the Persians. Herodotus concludes (VII.174)

> The Thessalians, being bereft of their allies, did thereupon take the Persian part whole-heartedly and with no further doubt, so that in their acts they approved themselves men most useful to the king.

Diodorus XI.3 (writing three centuries later) gives a different spin, with less credit to the Thessalians:

> But since the large number of the Thessalians and other Greeks who dwelt near the passes had given the water and earth to the envoys of Xerxes when they arrived, the two generals despaired of the defence at Tempê and returned to their own soil.

He adds a little more detail (Herodotus gives almost the same list at VII.132):

> The Aenianians, Dolopians, Melians, Perrhaebians, and Magnetans took the side of the barbarians even while the defending force was still at Tempê, and after its departure the Achaeans of Phthia, Locrians, Thessalians, and the majority of the Boeotians went over to the barbarians.

So it look like all the ancient sources believe the Thessalians chose discretion over valor

However once they had signed on with the Persians, the alliance was powered by an extra heaping of traditional Greek fractiousness. Herodotus says that when the Great King’s army rolled through Thermopylae and in to Phocis, the Thessalians sent messengers to the Phocians, their traditional enemies:

> “Men of Phocis, it is time now that you confess yourselves to be no match for us. We were ever formerly preferred before you by the Greeks, as long as we were on their side; and now we are of such weight with the foreigner that it lies in our power to have you deprived of your lands, ay, and yourselves enslaved withal. Nevertheless, though all rests with us, we bear you no ill‑will for the past; pay us fifty talents of silver for what you did, and we promise to turn aside what threatens your land."

When the Phocians — who of course lost no love for the Thessalians — refused this offer the Thessalians happily guided the Persian forces into Phocis. The destruction of Phocis was, after that of Athens , the most intense of the war.

> The foreigners overran the whole of Phocis, the Thessalians so guiding their army; and all that came within their power they burnt and wasted, setting fire to towns and temples.

Herodotus VIII.32
