Your best bet is to come up with a phony oracle* to put a face saving spin on the situation and then troop off home. That’s the good option for the Spartans here. Only one or two Spartan commanders — Brasidas, maybe Gylippus — would be smart enough to figure it out before things got embarrassing.

There are two dimensions to the problem.

The first one is the __longbows__ . Spartans would have a bad first encounter here, because they’d come to the field with some degree of confidence in their ability to shrug off archery. The big _hoplon_  shield and a bronze cuirass offered a lot of protection against the kind of archers they were used to facing. At least in our sources, it seems like Persian archers could not really hope to penetrate Greek armor at 100 yards — this meant that in battles like Marathon, Thermopylae and Cunaxa a Greek phalanx only had to shrug off a couple of volleys before they charged into the ranks of lightly-armed archers. Arrows were a threat to exposed arms and legs — or eyes — but a well managed formation could and usually did weather them effectively.

English longbows, however, were _significantly_  more powerful than Persian bows — the Persian bow draw weights were usually around 80 lbs, while the English bows drew twice that. Persian arrows were reeds tipped with bronze, English shafts were hardwood tipped by steel arrowheads that had a millennium and a half of metallurgical advances built in.

There’s a lot of controversy about the ability of a longbowman to penetrate medieval European steel armor at range — optimists think that iron might be penetrable at 200 yards and steel around 75; pessimists might drop those by half or more. Bronze will perform a bit better than iron, but Greek armor will be thinner than its medieval counterparts. The upshot is that at best the Spartans will suffer a lot more than they expect. At worst it could be a disaster if the Spartans are overconfident.

Still, archers don’t usually win battles on their own against men at arms — the famous longbow battles were all won with the support of knights and footmen. However the question specifies a __castle__ . Not only does that mean there won’t be any fearsome hoplite charge through the arrows and into the plucky English — it means the Spartans should probably just give up.

Despite their warlike reputation, the Spartans were mediocre military engineers. Spartans were warrior-aristocrats who looked down on the grubby business of engineering: only the push of pikes on the battlefield was ‘real’ war. It took an entire generation of warfare to force them to apply the same determination to engineering (and naval warfare) that they showed on land.

It might not be surprising that the Spartans never tried to breach the walls of Athens despite a thirty years of war — but were also stymied by the tiny town of Plataea, where a mere 500 defenders held them off for _two years._  Even then almost half of the defenders broke out and escaped before they town finally fell. The Spartans did take a handful of places by storm, but their most reliable tactic was starvation.

So, if you can afford to build a wall around the castle to keep those English Johnnies locked in and keep supplies of food out, you’ll have them eventually … though unlike a hoplite, that helot toting stones make siege wall is not wearing armor so your wall is going to have to be at least 300 yards from the castle!

Lacking artillery, mining expertise, and sophisticated siege weapons it’s highly unlikely that Spartans could take a well-built medieval castle. A 14th century castle from the age of Agincourt and Crecy was significantly more sophisticated than anything the Spartans had ever faced, with layer defenses and well-planned fields of fire. The walls of Athens, which the Spartans never breached, were only about 30 feet high — not only were there plenty of taller walls among English castles, their tallest towers might reach 80 feet or more. Depending on where you got you longbowmen, they may even have had to withstand gunpowder sieges : the longbow fought along side cannon as early as Crecy, in 1346 and the first wall breached by a cannon was in 1376, a generation before Agincourt.

Suffice to say, a 14th or 15th century castle manned by veterans of Crecy, Poitiers or Agincourt was a tougher nut than any a Spartan army ever cracked.
