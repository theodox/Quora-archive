Persia was not unusually or extraordinarily weak when Alexander attacked. 

However the nature of empire in that era makes many of our modern assumptions about political power very misleading. The empire was huge and powerful and able to put together very impressive forces along with the finances and technical know how to make them work. It was not, however, a modern nation state with comprehensive control over local life - it was more like a giant alliance of many different local power structures which cooperated (with varying degrees of enthusiasm ) with the royal house. 

The Persian "nation" was a only a small minority of the people who inhabited the empire: for most residents, the change of masters was unlikely to affect their daily lives much at all, and they had little stake in the fighting either way. If you were a village chief or a local noble, you merely checked the way the winds seemed to be blowing and switched allegiance from the Persians to the Greeks, just as your great-grandfather had from the Medes to the Persians and before that from Lydians or Assyrians or whomever to the Medes.

To get a good flavor for how limited Persian control of the empire really was, read the [Anabasis of Xenophon](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1170/1170-h/1170-h.htm), which chronicles how a Greek mercenary army of 10,000 marched clear across Asia minor, from the battle of [Battle of Cunaxa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cunaxa) to [Trebizond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabzon), hardly interacting with the official Persian empire at all: they fought or traded with lots of local communities and some regional Persian forces -- but a large army basically walked straight from Mesopotamia to the Black Sea. 

To some degree this reflects the fact that the Persians really could not cope with Greek heavy infantry. But it's mostly an illustration of the fact that the empire was a network of relationships between local and regional elites, not a tightly state. If you could defeat the very top echelon and were smart enough to deal with the lower ranks, rather than pointlessly antagonizing or trying to extort them, you could step into the top place while leaving the rest of the affected nations largely intact, just as the Persians themselves had done.
