Marius is certainly _famous_ , and in his heyday he was also very popular. He was the hero of two wars, including [one which probably saved Rome from extinction.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimbrian_War) He was hailed in his day as the "third founder of Rome" and was elected consul an unprecedented six* times. So he was hardly obscure.

His legacy, however, is terribly disfigured by the last years of his career. 

In his sixth consulship he connived at the populist bully tactics of his ally [Saturninus. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Appuleius_Saturninus)When Saturninus stooped to outright murder, Marius put him and his supporters down by force -- but was widely seen as compromised by both the populists and the aristocrats. After several years of self-imposed absence he returned to take command of Roman forces in the Social War, but his military performance was lackluster and he openly resented the successes of his former protege Sulla. 

Once again Marius made common cause with a radical politician, [Publius Sulpicius Rufus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Sulpicius_Rufus) who used violence to strip Sulla of a prestigious command and transfer it to the aging popular hero -- precipitating Sulla's march on Rome in 88 BC, the first military insurrection against the city in its history. Most of Sulla's officers refused to follow him but his soldiers fell in with gusto, presaging more than a century of military coups. Ironically, it was Marius' own military reforms which filled the army with landless peasants and the urban poor, whose loyalties lay with the generals who provided them with plunder rather than the state they theoretically served.

Driven out by Sulla, Marius hid in Carthage until his rival departed once again for his campaigns. Marius returned with his own private army (raised among his veterans -- another ominous foretaste of the coming century) and installed himself at Rome along with the radical consul [Cinna.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Cinna) Marius quickly surpassed Sulla's example with a widespread reign of political terror and personal vendettas. Even his supporters were disgusted by his tactics -- the populist commander [Quintus Sertorius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Sertorius) finally resorted to a surprise attack on Marius' thugs when Marius refused to reign them in. Marius was annointed ("elected" would be a euphemism) consul for a record-setting seventh time, but -- probably best for all concerned -- dies less than a month into his term in 86 BC.

The nearly universal opinion of antiquity was that Marius has disgraced his extraordinary achievements by his resort to terror. To quote Plutarch, _"he_ __ _put the ugliest possible crown upon a most illustrious career in field and forum.... driven by the blasts of passion, ill-timed ambition, and insatiable greed upon the shore of a most cruel and savage old age"_

 _Roman portraiture says it all. Sometimes, too much._
