There’s not much to go on in the way of direct evidence.

The library catalog was known as the [Pinakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinakes), but no copy of it survived. You can get an idea of the library’s priorities from the headings in the pinakes, which are mentioned by later authors. The known top-level categories were :

rhetoric

law

epic

tragedy

comedy

lyric poetry

history

medicine

mathematics

natural philosophy

miscellanies, ie, everything else

This looks a lot like the standard divisions of a Greek gentleman’s library: literature and public affairs predominated. All but one of the known librarians were scholars of literature — Homer and the poetry of classical Athens were the most prestigious subjects, with public affairs (law, history, and oratory) close behind. Prose fiction (that is, novels or short stories) was uncommon enough in antiquity that it did not get a heading of its own.

__Guesstimates__ 

We can get a general idea of the Library’s collection by comparing it to works that survived elsewhere. Although the Library’s collection was the largest in the ancient world, it was hardly the only one (Marc Antony offered Cleopatra the contents of the [Library of Pergamum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Pergamum) — about 200,000 scrolls — to replace those lost in Caesar’s destruction of the original library; Rome is said to have had 24 major libraries at least before the sack of the city by the Goths in 410). So, the survivals elsewhere give a rough idea of what ancient libraries looked like.

For a general ideal — not rigorously statistical, but suggestive — consider this graph is from the [Thesaurus Linguae Graecae](http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu), the most comprehensive collection of Greek texts on line. It gives a really good idea of how conservative the Greek literary canon was*:

The Library existed from around 300 BC to 47 BC — but, as you can see, surviving Greek literature from the classical period outnumber later authors considerably, including authors from the time when the library was in operation.* To reinforce the point, here’s a table (from [this article](http://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/viewFile/10921/4271)) showing the count of the finds of papyrus scrolls elsewhere in Greco-Roman Egypt. Like the TLG sample it shows a strong bias toward the classics, particularly Athenian authors — only three of the top twenty authors (Menander, Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes) come from after about 300 BC, and all of them are poets or historians with the exception of Plato.†

If you consider the names on that list of surviving authors, you can see that [technical subjects were fairly rare](https://www.quora.com/How-likely-is-it-that-we-havent-discovered-or-been-able-to-glean-most-if-not-all-of-what-was-supposedly-lost-during-the-destruction-of-the-Library-at-Alexandria/answer/Steve-Theodore). The list above over-states the dominance of literature, since (just as now) ordinary citizens were more likely to have literature than science or math in their private libraries; unfortunately we can’t quantify how different the library might have been. However on the whole there are hundreds of known Greek authors in the humanities, but only dozens of scientific or technical ones.

Medicine and math (which according to Greek fashion, included astronomy and music) were prestige subjects worthy of the kind of gentleman-scholars who the Library was meant to serve. The most influential authors in those areas survive, because they were in wide circulation. “Natural philosophy” covered a wide range of material from observational biology to abstract meditations about the essential nature of the universe. Surviving works there tend to include a lot of recycled material, sometimes from hundreds of years earlier — that suggests it was not a particularly lively field. Explicitly technical material that didn’t fall under one of these headings — for example engineering or shipbuilding — was extremely rare; as far as we know the only practical subjects in Greek libraries were agriculture, architecture and military engineering.



* To clear, though, this graph is definitely _not_  a complete list of every known author — only of surviving works that are more or less complete and made it into the TLG database. Including references and authors who exist only in fragments and quotations would expand it by about ten times — however the relative fixation on classical, particularly classical Athenian authors would remain.

† Don’t count Origen and the anonymous _Shepherd of Hermas_ , both of which date from the Christian era and are Christian material.
