Before the Punic War period we have almost no reliable contemporary evidence — certainly no long-form historiography to compare with Herodotus or Thucydides in the Greek world. High quality information about Roman institutions really starts with [Polybius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius), who has first-hand knowledge of the years from about 190–146 BC and privileged access to people involved in the war against Hannibal, which concluded when he was a child. The oldest Latin-Language historian is [Cato the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Elder), who wrote at almost the same time.

We do know that there were older records — almost all lost to us, but surviving into the imperial period — which provided some of the data which show up in familiar histories; for example the [Fasti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasti#Roman_official_chronicles) and the [Annales maximi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annales_maximi). Noble families also maintained private histories recording the deeds and accomplishments of their distinguished ancestors: public occasions often involved family members wearing masks to impersonate important predecessors, helping to advertise the family’s accomplishments.

Nonetheless, the fasti, annales, and private records tend to be obsessively concerned with minutiae of battles, elections, and religious events: they don’t provide good data about things like the legal and constitutional structure of the Republic in the first two or two and a half centuries so skepticism is definitely warranted. Most of the famous stories recounted by Livy and Plutarch about the kingdom and the early Republic have to be regarded as oral traditions rather than “history” in the strict sense, and treated with appropriate caution.

An excellent summary of the ‘skeptical school’ is __[Roman Republics](https://www.amazon.com/Roman-Republics-Harriet-I-Flower-ebook/dp/B003E7FIPI/ref=sr_1_3?hvadid=3485634424&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvqmt=e&keywords=roman+republics&qid=1559000040&s=gateway&sr=8-3)__  by Harriet Flower.
