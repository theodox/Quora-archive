# If we don't know whether eratosthenes used an Egyptian stadian or a Greek one, then being the Alexandrian librarian and doing the experiment would indicate Egyptian which made our circumference 14% less making it only 35000km long?

We can’t be completely sure — Greek weights and measures were, generally, a mess with every city having slightly different absolute values for the same words. There were at least three major systems in common use and a host of minor variations.

A _stadion_ is the conventional unit large linear distances; it was universally recognized as representing 600 feet (ποδες_, “podes”)_ . However the measure of a foot varied in the Greek world — we occasionally find [examples of Greek tools with markings for different systems.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40027151) The most common values for the foot would be Attic (294mm), Doric (326mm) and Ionic (348mm). The Egyptian version of a foot (a _djeser_ ) would be 300mm. In practice, of course, the precision was a lot lower than numbers in millimeters would suggest.

Unfortunately we don’t have a good way to guess what Eratosthenes’ unit system was — it’s not recorded. And we don’t know how he got his measurements — Greek and Egyptian surveyors both had tools and techniques of their own, which we know at least a little about. But our texts don’t tell us if Eratosthenes hired someone who was a professional land surveyor, or asked a traveler, or used a government record, or what.

We do know that the Eratosthenes measured the angular distance between Alexandria and Syene and found it to be roughly 1/50th of a circle, or 7.2 degrees. We also know that his final calculation for the earth’s circumference was 252,000 _stadia_ . Applying that to 600-foot _stadia_ using the figures above, we get:

Attic: 44,452.8 km 
Doric: 49,291.2 km
Ionic: 52,617.6 km
Egyptian: 45,360 km

… all of which are actually pretty far from the measured value which is __40,075 km__ ; the closest one are still 10% too high.

We also have a pretty good check on this range. The Roman natural historian Pliny says this:

> Eratosthenes, a man who was peculiarly well skilled in all the more subtle parts of learning, and in this above everything else, and a person whom I perceive to be approved by every one, has stated the whole of this circuit to be 252,000 stadia, which, according to the Roman estimate, makes 31,500 miles. The attempt is presumptuous, but it is supported by such subtle arguments that we cannot refuse our assent.

To some degree this is classic Roman sniffing at too-clever Greeks. However it gives an ancient conversion into a unit that’s much more stable: the Roman mile is much better established than stadion — the usual modern estimate is 1.479 km. Pliny’s conversion gives us __46,588.5 km.__ That’s similar to the estimate based on Egyptian feet — but it’s still too big.** In essence, though, nobody in the Hellenistic Greek world really had the tools or the need for the kind of accurate, abstract measurements we take for granted today; that built-in imprecision is the other reason for Pliny’s somewhat ironic endorsement.

However — and here’s where it gets interesting — there’s also [the wisdom of crowds.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds) Individually recorded distances in Greek geometry are not that great, between the vagaries of different units and the practicalities of measurement without modern tools. It turns out that the [average real-world length of a stadion is 157 meters](https://www.jstor.org/stable/295030). That’s notably shorter than any of the calculated examples above. But if you multiply__ that figure against Eratosthenes’ 252,000 stades you’ll get you get __39,564 km__ , which is pretty dang close to the measured figure for the Earth.***

Alas, that’s probably a lucky coincidence that cancels out some of the inaccuracies in Eratosthenes’ experiment, unless perhaps a _stadion_  as measured by professional travelers really was a good bit shorter than the _stadion_  as calculated from smaller values for some reason — perhaps its similar to the difference between “[statute miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile#Statute_mile)” and “[nautical miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile)”

The real likelihood is that Eratosthenes know that his number for the distance to Syene was a bit fuzzy and the whole thing was the ancient Greek equivalent of [a modern physicist calculating how many megatons of energy are expended when Professor McGonagall morphs into a cat](https://amzn.to/31kCLYR): an intellectual exercise rather than an engineering effort.

It’s worth remembering that there were at least 2 other efforts to do the same calculation and none of them agree: Posidonius gave 180,000 stadia and Hipparchus gave 278,000. None of these specify their units either.

In any case, don’t let the lack of numerical precision prevent you from admiring Eratosthenes’ audacity and cleverness. Armed with nothing more than a stick, a pen, and something to write on he did an amazing job at estimating the size of the earth. If he’d had a laser rangefinder, what else might he have accomplished?



* you’ll note that works out 5,040 stades from Alexandria to Syene — the internet tends to repeat a nice round 5,000. Pliny and Censorinus quote the less round number; the rounded-off 5000 comes from [Cleomedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleomedes), who is [give the longest description](https://books.google.com/books?id=tLBHhvoEnDwC&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q&f=false). Interestingly it’s _more_ likely that 5040, rather than 5000 is a ‘rounded off’ number — 5040 is divisible by 60 and 360, so it simplifies calculations dealing with angles and doing all your math longhand without decimals.
** A Roman foot, incidentally, is 295.7mm, similar to an Attic foot. But the Romans didn’t use stadia; a Roman mile was 5000 Roman feet. Pliny converts assumes 1 mile is 8 _stadia._ 
*** Several sources online confidently assert an “Egyptian _stadion_ ” of 157.5 meters. That’s essentially the average value used here. However I’ve never seen archaeological or textual confirmation of that - if anybody knows where that comes from please note it in the comments!
