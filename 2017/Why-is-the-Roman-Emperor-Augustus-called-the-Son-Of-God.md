Strictly speaking his title is _divi filius,_ “son of the deified.” “Son of God” would be _dei filius._ 

The “deified” in this case refers to Julius Caesar, who was Augustus’ adopted father. When Caesar was assassinated his supporters believed (or affected to believe) that he had achieved immortality. Depending on who you asked in 44 BC that might have been a literal belief in Caesar’s miraculous afterlife or a polite nod to his political legacy. “Deification” was a standard part of political language of the Greek world (Alexander the Great had proclaimed himself a god while still alive, and most Greek rulers — including Caesar’s mistress, Cleopatra — used some kind of religious language in their titles. Moreover the Romans generally practiced ancestor worship, so offering prayers and homage to the deceased Caesar didn’t strike contemporaries as particularly shocking.

For Augustus the really important part was not the _divi_ , it was the _filius._ His whole political persona was based on his relationship with Caesar. There were several possible rivals for the leadership of Caesar’s political faction after the murder; Augustus took every possible opportunity to emphasize his tie to his “father,” even forbidding people to address him in the usual form for adoptees.
