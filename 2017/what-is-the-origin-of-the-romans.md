Linguistically, Latin is part of the Italic branch of the Indo -European language family, so it's related to the other languages of Europe. Internal evidence is thought to have this group of languages splitting off from other ones in the same group some time between 5 and 6 thousand years ago. Outside of other Italian languages its closest relatives are in the Celtic, Germanic, and Illyrian families (Greek is also related but more distantly).

Genetically, modern Italians tend to reflect the makeup of Southern Europe. Northern Italy in Roman times was settled primarily by Gauls, and looks a lot like southern France in genetic makeup. Southern Italy has some similarity to Greece (much of the area was settled be Greeks in the early Iron Age) but is mostly consistent with the general Neolithic population of Europe.

Roman tradition claimed that the original settlers of Rome were the descendants of Trojans fleeing the Trojan war. That's highly unlikely, although early Rome was dominated by the Etruscans, a neighboring people of uncertain origins whose language is sometimes believed to be similar to languages of western Asia Minor and the North Aegean, so there may be a tiny grain of truth under the myth (there is also a small but measurable genetic influence from the same region in the vicinity of Rome itself, though not all over Italy, which adds some weight to the myths).

Archaeological evidence suggests that the main material influences on early Italy came down from the northeast, via the [Urnfield culture ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urnfield_culture), which was centered in Central Europe about thirty five hundred years ago.
