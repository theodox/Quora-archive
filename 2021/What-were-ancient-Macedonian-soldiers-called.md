Here’s a Macedonian army glossary. It’s necessarily a bit long, since we’re really talking about a few hundred years of sometimes quite different circumstances.

The Macedonians often used conventional Greek terms in their written records — so military service is __strateia,__ στρατεία , a cavalryman is a __hippeus,__ ἱππεύς, and a generic soldier is a __stratiotes,__ στρατιώτης.

Here are a few more precise terms which either originated in Macedonian usage or which had special meanings in a Macedonian context.

__Agema__ Ἄγημα denotes an elite corps, and originallt could be either a foot or a cavalry formation. Alexander’s famous “Companions” were the cavalry agema, while his foot agema contained both hypaspists and argyraspides.

__Argyraspides__ Ἀργυράσπιδες or “Silver Shields” were a picked unit, originally hypaspists in Alexander’s day but in the later Hellenistic kingdoms there where sarissa-armed phalangites and cavalry units which used the name.

__Chalkaspides__ Χαλκάσπιδες (“Bronze Shields”), __Leukaspides__ Λευκάσπιδες (“White Shields”), and __Chrysaspides__ Χρυσάσπιδες (“gold shields”) dividions of the overall infantry. The names seem to have been formed in imitation of the original Argyraspides.

__Hetairos__ ἑταῖρος, “Companion” a member of the elite royal guard cavalry which accompanied the king. Originally these were mostly noblemen, but over time the ranks were filled out with elite horsemen of a variety of backgrounds. Whatever their ethnicity they were almost always wealthy, since the hetairos was expected to provide his own horse and equipment. Sometimes they were referred to as __philoi__ , φιλοι, literally “friends” of the king. Unlike most contemporary Greek cavalry, who were lightly armored and fought with javelin, the hetairoi used lances and wore armored corselets and helmets.

__Hypsaspist__ Ὑπασπιστής a spear-armed infantryman, armed like a traditional Greek hoplite rather than the more famous Macedonian sarissa. In the Hellenistic kingdoms the name applies to elite units like royal bodyguards, distinct from ordinary infantry.

__Phalangite__ φαλαγγίτης__,__ a member of the Macedonian phalanx armed with a full-sized sarissa (pike) and carrying a small shield.

__Peltast__ πελταστής, a light infantryman armed with javelins and a light wicker shield, usually crescent shaped. In later times, this term became less descriptive and was used more or less as a synonym for any type of mercenary. Alexander’s elite peltasts were the [Agrianes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrianes), originally a tribal unit from upper Macedonia; but in later times the unit name was repeated in the successor kingdoms whether or not the soldiers were ethnically Agrianian.

__Petzhetairos__ πεζέταιρος__,__ “foot companion” — a flattering name for the ordinary phalangite infantryman, giving them something of the glory of the more famous “Companions” who made up the elite royal guard cavalry.

__prodromos__ πρ_ό_ δρομος “front-runner” a scout cavalryman.

__sarissophoros__ σάρισσοφορος, “lancer” a cavalryman armed with a lance — sometimes this is used interchangeably with _prodromos_ , suggesting unarmored lancers.

__thureophoros__ θυρεοφόρος, “shield bearer” an infantryman equipped with a large oval shield, a helmet, and a spear (but not a sarissa). In Hellenistic times this was a medium infantry type that may derive from Roman or Italian models. Alexander did not use thureophoroi, they emerged in the late third century BC.

__thorakites__ θωρακίτης, “curassier” a medium-heavy infantryman armed like a thureophoros but also wearing an armored breastplate or chainmail. This is another development of the Hellenistic era.
