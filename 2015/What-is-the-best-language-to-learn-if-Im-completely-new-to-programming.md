Swift is a neat language if you want to develop IOS apps -- although my personal experience has been that anything complex will require significant knowledge of existing Obj-C libraries and techniques too. That makes it a bit trickier than just 'learning to program' and you'll need to be careful about picking up books which cover both the Swift programming style and the IOS specific api's you'll be using.

You could also try something like[ Xamarin ](http://xamarin.com/download-it?_bt=101035044668&_bk=xamarin&_bm=e&gclid=CjwKEAiAtf6zBRDS0oCLrL37gFUSJACr2JYbv9DRWLvztnUQSNRbOlBm38QGm9_Rn9RspAX8CJFV_xoC1Azw_wcB)which uses C# -- a nice, fairly straightforward modern language (very similar to Java: the basic concepts translate pretty well). C# knowledge will also apply well to other platforms (and to Unity games).
