If you've got a good grasp of formal grammar -- if you know the the parts of a sentence and verb tenses -- it's not that hard. If you know more than one European language (say, French and Spanish -- or even Italian and German) it's relatively easy because you'll start to spot the structural similarities and shared vocabulary. All languages are a bit irrational (try explaining “the” to a Chinese speaker, or how we get from 'mouse' to 'mice' or 'run' to 'ran'!) but Latin isn't much worse. Ancient Greek is more of a stretch. There's lots of good stuff online and in book form).
