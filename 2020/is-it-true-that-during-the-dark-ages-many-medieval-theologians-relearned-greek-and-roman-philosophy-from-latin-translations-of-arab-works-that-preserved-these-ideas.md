Original wording: __Is it true that during the dark ages, many medieval theologians relearned Greek and Roman philosophy from Latin translations of Arab works that preserved these ideas?__ 

It’s not quite correct as phrased, though there’s no question that Arabic transmission of Greek works was very important for European intellectual history.

“__Dark Ages__ ” (to the extent that it’s anything but a piece of name calling) describes the period from the fall of the Roman empire until around the time of Charlemagne — call it 500 to 800 in round numbers. In this era the older unified Roman world became a series of short-lived warring kingdoms, long distance trade declined, cities emptied out, and the population declined. Literary culture, which was always a luxury for the wealthy, suffered correspondingly.

By the end of the seventh century Greek literacy was in steep decline everywhere in the west. It never completely died — but what had once been a live connection to the intellectual life of the Greek world became isolated, esoteric knowledge. And — given the fact that papyrus rarely lasts a century in a European climate — nobody bothered to recopy Greek scrolls they could not read. Names like Plato or Aristotle remained in circulation but the texts did not. Latin readers knew about Greek ideas secondhand primarily in paraphrases, or in reference works like the [Etymologiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymologiae#:~:text=Etymologiae%20(Latin%20for%20%22The%20Etymologies,the%20end%20of%20his%20life.&text=Etymologiae%20was%20the%20most%20used%20textbook%20throughout%20the%20Middle%20Ages) of Isidore of Seville.

Eventually many key Greek texts would re-enter the European world through translations originating in Muslim areas — however for the most part this happened well after the end of the so-called dark ages. The flow of texts really became marked only in the 12th century, a long time after the conventional end date of the dark ages.

Since most of the land area of the new Arab empire was former Roman territory, so it was natural that the creators of the new Arabic-language culture would borrow from the material they had ready to hand. Greek technical works — things like mathematics, astronomy and medicine — were the standard ways of doing things in most of the now-Arab world. As people adopted Arabic for religious, cultural or business reasons many of these were translated or adapted just as many of them had once been translated or adapted into Latin.

In the earliest centuries of the Islamic era the less practical material was usually not translated. Literary works were mostly ignored — you don’t find a lot of Arabic manuscripts of _Oedipus Rex_ or the _Iliad._ The first few generations of the caliphate generally regarded philosophical writings with suspicion, too, but many authors — Aristotle being a prime example — covered technical material alongside their more abstract concerns, which helped them survive.

_Aristotle, on the chair, teaching his students_ 

By around the 9th century, those old texts were being put to new uses. A series of Persian scholars (most famously [Al-Farabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Farabi) and [Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna)) adapted the Greek traditions to their own investigations. They expanded and critiqued everything from propositions in mathematics to medicine to formal logic. Their work became classics everywhere in the Arab-speaking world, sparking further evolutions and debates and adding a new chapter to the centuries long seesaw of influence between traditions going back to Plato and those going back to Aristotle.

These Arab works reached Europe for the same reasons the Greek texts were translated into Arabic — medicine and mathematics in particular were of obvious practical use regardless of faith. But just as Arab readers were inspired by the methods and argumentation they found in Greek books, European readers also discovered useful tools for themselves. Spain and Sicily — both areas where there were mixed populations and Latin speakers lived alongside Arabic speakers — were the primary venues for translations.

The superstar of this wave of translations was [Averroes](https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/novemberdecember/feature/the-islamic-scholar-who-gave-us-modern-philosophy), a scholar from Spain who wrote detailed commentaries on Aristotle’s originals. Ironically in his home country his work — which was very passionately committed to Aristotle’s views, even when they conflicted with Islam — got him in a lot of trouble. However his work on Aristotle was a runaway success in Europe. Thomas Aquinas, by far the most famous and influential Catholic theologian, disagreed with Averroes about many things but he still refers to him as, simply, “the commentator” — the man whose opinions about Aristotle had to be understood. Aristotelian logic (often, as viewed through the lens of Averroes or the Spanish Rabbi [Maimonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides)) became the most important intellectual tool of medieval theologians.

Interestingly the Arab texts that made it to Europe were much lighter on Plato (a reflection, again, of the way the Arabic language partisans of Plato and Aristotle disagreed with each other). Plato had a high but very vague reputation in the European middle ages, and very little of his own work was available in translation. Platonic texts really only became widely available in the 14th century, and when they did they were generally coming from Byzantine libraries in the original Greek.
