It’s not unambiguously clear: the image is hard to see well and there are no accompanying attributes that would help play spot-the-deity.

That said, I’d bet a couple of bucks on it being Venus. Caesar liked to claim a special relationship with Venus through his family tie to Aeneas and the Trojan War. Venus was the goddess of good luck as well as the goddess of “love,” — Caesar, who loved to push his luck, made a lot of public points about how he was “fortune’s favorite.” So this could be the show’s nod to Octavian’s adopting the mantle of Caesar. Since this is supposed to be close to the end of the triumphal procession, which will have been coming into the forum from the east this might be intended to stand in for Caesar’s [Temple of Venus Genetrix.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Venus_Genetrix)

A second choice would by the [Roma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma_(mythology)), the mythological embodiment of Rome. Around the time of the events in that episode, Octavian was formalizing the early beginnings of what would become the imperial cult. At this early stage, with republican attitudes still very much in the air, he disguised the efforts of his flatterers and toadies to offer him divine worship by insisting that the worshipfully inclined could offer sacrifices to _dea Roma_  and include the emperor’s _genius,_ essentially what we’d call his guardian angel, in their rights… skating as close to accepting divine honors as a Roman would dare. If you read the stuff above the face as a “mural crown” — a crown shaped like city walls — that would be the clincher. My eyesight’s not good enough to be sure.

Apollo would be a good guess on some levels. Octavian used a lot of subtle and not-so-subtle allusions to Apollo in his propaganda motifs. But he didn’t favor representations with this kind of super-lush hairdo, which was a bit to Greek-y for the Old Fashioned Roman public persona he liked to project. Plus if the picture on the placards being waved by the crowd later in the scene is the same deity, the smaller version seems to be more clearly female. The fact that this scene has all of the series’ surviving female leads in one room suggests a gendered space of some kind.
