Usually, “increasing your word count” makes your writing _worse_ .

Effective writing is efficient — it says what needs to be said with a minimum of padding. Most classic writing advice books will encourage you to trim the fat:

> “Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences…This requires not that the writer make all sentences short, or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.”

That said: learning to write concisely will slow you down, at first. Those seconds spent picking the right words or pruning away useless phrases all add up.

However, once you get the rhythm of concise writing you’ll be communicating more with fewer words, which is _faster_ . It simply takes time to adjust your personal style to a different cadence. Like any other skill, it’s largely a matter of practice and discipline.

If you’re worried about word counts for something like a school project, that ought to come from the content, not the writing style. When your 500 word essay comes in at a mere 300 words, you don’t want 200 words of stylish fluff to pad it out — you want to ensure that what you are saying is interesting enough.

Many writers adopt the compromise of writing quickly and sloppily while trying to understand the subject matter, and then applying all of the sage advice during the process of trimming the long, sloppy first draft into a clean, tight final version. Allowing yourself permission to move fast and be messy in the early stage of a project is also a great antidote to writer’s block.
