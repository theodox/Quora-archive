# Why did the ancient Greeks in the Persian wars use runners as messengers? Couldn't they have used horses? Wouldn't that have been faster?

Riders were used, sometimes. However horses in this period were expensive: typically only aristocrats could afford to keep a horse and learn how to ride. Before the time of Alexander (who came from Macedon: a good horse country compared to Attica or Sparta). Before Alexander’s era, Greek cavalry wasn’t very numerous or very impressive: during the classical period Athens was never able to field more than a thousand horsemen at once.

The main account of Marathon (the one in [Herodotus, 6. 94](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.%206.94&lang=original) and following) makes no mention of any Athenian cavalry at all. Given that the Athenians were worried that the Persians would take their ships and run around Cape Sounion, outpacing the slow-moving Athenian infantry, it’s likely that the cavalry was detached from the main army and watching the rest of the coast. The Athenians knew that their cavalry was no match for the Persians, who were better riders and better mounted; it’s possible that they didn’t want to spare even a single horse for courier duty.
