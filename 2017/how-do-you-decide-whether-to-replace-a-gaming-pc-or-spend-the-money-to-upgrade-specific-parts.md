Nowadays my usual order of operations is video card first, memory second, and CPU/mobo last. However If you still have platter drives upgrading to an SSD is a great first step— it makes everything feel snappier.

I generally don't replace a mobo until it's clear that it's hard to get good cards or memory sticks for it, and I rarely replace a CPU unless I'm swapping boards. These days processor speed improvements are happening more and more slowly but GPUs are still improving rapidly; and most games still do a bad job of leveraging extra cores well so it's not usually the first thing I look at.

The other thing to do is to be aware of where your existing box sits as regards power — a video card that's too beefy for your power supply is a endless source of frustration, so don't buy without checking the ratings on your power supply!
