It’s not impossible but it is unlikely. The Carthaginians were pretty aggressive about monopolizing the sea lanes of the western Mediterranean in this period.

The Greeks did visit the western seas from fairly early times, but the rise of Carthaginian sea power seems to have essentially turned the waters west of Sicily into a de-facto Carthaginian lake. You can see this reflected in the sudden drop off in Greek colonization in the sixth century BC. Greeks had planted colonies in Spain ([Empuries](https://www.worldhistory.org/Empuries/#:~:text=Definition&text=Empuries%20(also%20Emporiae%20or%20Emporion,to%20the%202nd%20century%20CE.) settled 575 BC), France ([Massilia](https://www.worldhistory.org/massilia/), settled 600 BC) and Corsica ([Alalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al%C3%A9ria), settled 566). However the [naval battle of Alalia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alalia)sometime in the 530’s seems to have been the last hurrah for Greek naval power in the western Mediterranean — although the Greeks won the day off Corsica the Carthaginians and the Etruscans allied against this new threat, with the Etruscans dominating the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Carthaginians controlling the waters around Sicily. It probably didn’t help that around the same time the Persians showed up in Asia Minor, eliminating several of the more ambitious Greek cities in the region (notably [Phocaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocaea), mother-city of both Massilia and Empuries) which was mostly abandoned once the Persians arrived in 545).

So, within a few years of Alalia, Greek shipping more or less disappeared from the coasts of the Maghreb and of Iberia. We don’t have the details of the legal regime but you can get a flavor for how this was structured from the treaty the Carthaginians imposed on Rome in 509:

> Neither the Romans nor their allies are to sail beyond the Fair Promontory [[Calacte](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=calacte-geo), on the north coast of Sicily] , unless driven by stress of weather or the fear of enemies. If any one of them be driven ashore he shall not buy or take aught for himself save what is needful for the repair of his ship and the service of the gods, and he shall depart within five days.

> Men landing for traffic shall strike no bargain save in the presence of a herald or town-clerk. Whatever is sold in the presence of these, let the price be secured to the seller on the credit of the state—that is to say, if such sale be in [Libya](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/entityvote?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0234:book=3:chapter=22&auth=tgn,1000172&n=1&type=place) or [Sardinia](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/entityvote?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0234:book=3:chapter=22&auth=tgn,7003121&n=1&type=place).

Zone 1 is forbidden to foreign shipping; Zone 2 is accessible only in emergencies and under supervision; Zone 3 is accessible but — this being right after the foundation of the Roman Republic — ultimately subject to the whims of Etruscan naval forces._ 

All of this meant that any Greek who did make it to Lixus in fifth century did so as a passenger on a Carthaginian ship. [Greek-Carthaginian relations were mostly hostile in this era,](https://www.heritage-history.com/index.php?c=resources&s=war-dir&f=wars_sicilian) although the presence of Greek trade goods shows that commercial ties were still strong throughout. So, overall, it would not be surprising if no Greek ever made it to Lixus in this era — if there were a few, they will have been rather exotic and hardly a regularly seen part of the local scene. That doesn’t of course preclude the presence of Greek goods, particularly Attic pottery, which circulated in all sorts of places through the carriage trade.
