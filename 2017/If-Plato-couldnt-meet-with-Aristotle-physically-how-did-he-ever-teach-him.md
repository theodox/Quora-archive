_Note: Question title was originally_ ___If Plato couldn’t mate with Aristotle physically, how did he ever teach him?___ _First paragraph retained for historical reasons._ 

_I’m going to assume you meant meet Aristotle physically. The other option is very, er, Greek… but otherwise not supported by textual evidence.*_ 

The two men had no problem _meeting._ Aristotle (born 384 BC) was much younger than Plato (born sometime between 428 and 424 BC) but Plato lived to be almost 80 years old. When Aristotle arrived in Athens — roughly 366 BC — Plato was in his early 60’s. Plato continued to run the Academy until his death in 348, so Aristotle was first his student and then a fellow teacher at the [Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_Academy) for 18 years or so.

Some traditions hold that Aristotle left after Plato’s death, when the Academy passed to Aristotle’s nephew [Speusippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speusippus); some modern scholars think the real reason was that anti-Macedonian sentiment was growing in Athens at the time. Aristotle did a little bit of travelling in Asia Minor before returning to Macedonia in 343 to take up the job of tutoring Alexander.



* Plato did connect the drive for learning with _eros_ , however…
