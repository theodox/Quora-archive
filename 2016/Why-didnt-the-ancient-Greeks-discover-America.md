As the other answers point out, there's a big difference between more-or-less knowing about the existence of Iceland, -- for which the evidence is mixed but not too bad (see [Was Iceland known to the Romans?](https://www.quora.com/Was-Iceland-known-to-the-Romans)) -- and a reliable transatlantic voyage. We aren't really sure what the Greks "knew", given the kinds of sources we have and those we have lost. However we do have a pretty good idea of what they could and could not do in maritime technology. 

 Their greatest maritime achievement was the [monsoon trade](https://www.quora.com/I-have-heard-that-ancient-Greece-and-Rome-were-having-trades-with-south-Indian-kingdoms-But-in-history-why-werent-these-given-much-importance-and-not-talked-about) between Egypt and India (which was definitely the longest out-of-sight-of-land route we know of from Greco-Roman mariners) is roughly about half the distance of a route from "The Pillars of Hercules" (ie, Cadiz) to Newfoundland. It was a big deal in the 1s C BC -- the Greek equivalent of a moon shot -- but it's not a hard sail: the actual end points were well known long before the first voyage, and the predictable monsoon winds make for a comparatively easy sail in each direction once the route has been imagined (and the overland route had been known since the Babylonians). Moreover the monsoon is a 'trade wind' - it's reliable and it's also comparatively warm: you can sail it in an open boat.

The northern route to the Americas is much tougher, with adverse winds and higher seas. Greek ships were built 'shell style' -- the planking of the ship was it's own main structural member -- so there was a pretty strict limit on how big and more importantly how strong they were; the kind of skeletal structure that Medieval and Renaissance ships used for long voyages does not seem to have emerged until the 5th or 6th century AD.

_Greek-style shell construction puts the strength of the ship in its skin_

_Renaissance ships were built on a strongly reinforce skeletons which could withstand much more stresses -- but from wave action but also carrying larger presses of sail_  

On top of that Greek ships had a tough time pointing up into the wind. The introduction of [Lateen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateen) sails didn't come around till some time during the Roman era: before that the big square sails of Greek ships were poorly suited for tacking, making blue-water sailing much more dependent on good luck with the weather. A Greek galley, with lots of rowers to feed, would have had a hard time storing enough food and water to make the trip; a Greek round ship, with more cargo room and less crew might survive -- but the mediocre sailing qualities would make the voyage pretty dicey.

It's still not _completely_ inconceivable that a Greek ship or two might have made the trip on the southern route: westward from the Pillars of Hercules, more or less the way Columbus did it (although the Greeks only slightly touched on the Canary Islands and do not seem to have ever visited the Azores or the Cape Verdes). It's slightly more believable that the Phoenicians or Carthaginians -- who were really rather better sailors, having definitely [coasted Africa as far south as Cameroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanno_the_Navigator) and quite likely [circumnavigated Africa ](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/herodotus/herodotus-on-the-first-circumnavigation-of-africa/)-- would have tried it. However it's highly unlikely that ships which made the crossing would have ever _returned_ : the easy sailing route back from the Caribbean would take you to northern Ireland via the Gulf Stream to the Galway current: not back to familiar waters.
