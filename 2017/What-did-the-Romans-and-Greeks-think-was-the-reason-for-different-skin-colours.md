There was no single theory that was universally accepted. Here are the two main types of explanations, which I’m separating out but which in practice were often mixed and matched in various ways.

Before that I’ll just note that skin color wasn’t a primary point of reference in Greek thinking. The Greeks word for what we’d call black people was “_[Aethiops](https://www.quora.com/Why-werent-black-people-discovered-before-the-Europeans-found-them-Please-read-details/answer/Steve-Theodore)_ ” or “burnt-faced” which suggests some of the possible mythological explanations. Aethiop was a vague term which was not used consistently. To a Greek, somebody from modern Sudan or Ethiopia or farther south was an Aethiop; so was somebody from southern India. An Egyptian or a Mauretanian or a Libyan however was generally not. To the north, the Greeks took note of the fair hair and pale complexions of Gauls and Germans, although they [had a share of blondes and redheads of their own.](https://www.quora.com/Were-the-Ancient-Greeks-and-Romans-white/answer/Steve-Theodore)

__The influence of climate__ 

The most influential school of thought about population differences was probably the one based on the influence of climate. Starting in around the 4th century BC Greek natural philosophers (‘scientists’ would be a bit misleading in this context) theorized that the climate of a region affected the character and appearance of the people and animals that lived there.

They observed, correctly, that different environments tended to produce very different kinds of plants and animals. This led them to conclude that a given climate bred different kinds of plants.

The classic text on the subject is [Airs, Waters and Places.](http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/airwatpl.html) It’s traditionally supposed to be written by Hippocrates, the Athenian doctor who also gave us the Hippocratic oath. Here’s a good sample of the way that work talks about it (“Asia” here is Asia Minor and the Near East):

> I wish to show, respecting Asia and Europe, how, in all respects, they differ from one another, and concerning the figure of the inhabitants, for they are different, and do not at all resemble one another…. I say, then, that Asia differs very much from Europe as to the nature of all things, both with regard to the productions of the earth and the inhabitants, for everything is produced much more beautiful and large in Asia; the country is milder, and the dispositions of the inhabitants also are more gentle and affectionate. The cause of this is the temperature of the seasons, because it lies in the middle of the risings of the sun towards the east, and removed from the cold (and heat), for nothing tends to growth and mildness so much as when the climate has no predominant quality, but a general equality of temperature prevails.

> It is not everywhere the same with regard to Asia, but such parts of the country as lie intermediate between the heat and the cold, are the best supplied with fruits and trees, and have the most genial climate, and enjoy the purest waters, both celestial and terrestrial. For neither are they much burnt up by the heat, nor dried up by the drought and want of rain, nor do they suffer from the cold; since they are well watered from abundant showers and snow, and the fruits of the season, as might be supposed, grow in abundance, both such as are raised from seed that has been sown, and such plants as the earth produces of its own accord, the fruits of which the inhabitants make use of, training them from their wild state and transplanting them to a suitable soil; the cattle also which are reared there are vigorous, particularly prolific, and bring up young of the fairest description; the inhabitants too, are well fed, most beautiful in shape, of large stature, and differ little from one another either as to figure or size; and the country itself, both as regards its constitution and mildness of the seasons, may be said to bear a close resemblance to the spring. Manly courage, endurance of suffering, laborious enterprise, and high spirit, could not be produced in such a state of things either among the native inhabitants or those of a different country, for there pleasure necessarily reigns. For this reason, also, the forms of wild beasts there are much varied. Thus it is, as I think, with the Egyptians and Libyans.

In a very superficial way this sounds like the theory of evolution, but beyond the basic recognition of the relation between environment and adaptation it had little in common with Darwin.

In this view the Greeks — with typical Greek modesty — tended to see themselves as located precisely in the middle of the climactic extremes. To the north you had harsh climates which produced hard, violent, and uncivilized “Europeans.” To the south you had the soft, tropical richness of Egypt (don’t think desert: Egypt was the breadbasket of the ancient world, famous for fertility and lushness) which produced culture but also effeminacy. In the middle you had — the Greeks, who the Greeks regarded as a perfect mix of both extremes. Not too harsh (or too pale), not too soft (or too dark).

__Humorism__ 

The other approach to explaining population differences started with Greek medicine. This was dominated by the theory of the “[four humours](http://www.greekmedicine.net/b_p/Four_Humors.html)”, which were supposed to correspond to the four elements (earth, air, fire and water). Just as Greek physics tried to explain the material world as reflecting different proportions of these elements, so too any individual person’s nature was dictated by the relative admixture of the humors.

The four humors were __blood__ , which corresponded to air, inclined someone toward optimism, affection, and good cheer; __phlegm__ (in our terms, all the clear lymphatic fluids in the body), corresponded to water and inclined one to sensitivity, thoughtfulness, and passivity ; __yellow bile__ (we’d think of it as digestive acids) corresponded to fire and produced anger, ambition, and bravery; and __black bile (__ for us, the secretions of the spleen) produced caution, and realism, but also depression and cowardice. All of these terms have long afterlives: if you’re a bloody optimist, you’re _sanguine_ ; if you’re cool, you are _phlegmatic_ ; an angry person has _gall_  and is _bilious_ or _choleric_ , while if your spirits are low you have _melancholy_ where _melan_  is “black.”

You’ll not that the humors come color-coded: red and white for blood and phlegm, black and yellow for the two kinds of bile. This, not surprisingly, was easy to connect to skin color — though it’s hard to tell from the limited sources we have whether the color-coding of the humors evolved from observations about complexion or the other way around.

The Gauls - with their ruddy complexions and often red hair — were exhibit A for a temperament dominated by blood; Greeks saw them as optimistic and boastful, as cheerful but also unsteady and unserious. Too much blood, not enough phlegm. On the other hand the Egyptians were the classic examples of the a temperament with too much black bile: they were supposed to be intelligent and cautious, but also cowardly and unenterprising.

By a strange coincidence, in this view the Greeks tended to have the best balance of the four humors while other nations — strange! — tended to be overly influenced by one or another. However much of this was a mishmash of plain old chauvinism with the quasi-science of humorism. You can get a sense of the unsystematic nature of the observations from this bit of the [Physiognomonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiognomonics), a fourth century BC text formerly attributed to Aristotle:

> _Too black a hue marks the coward, as witness Egyptians and Ethiopians, and so does also too white a complexion, as you may see from women. So the hue that makes for courage must be intermediate between these extremes. A tawny color indicates a bold spirit, as in lions : but too ruddy a hue marks a rogue, as in the case of the fox. A pale mottled hue signifies cowardice, for that is the color one turns in terror. The honey-pale are cold, and coldness means immobility, and an immobile body means slowness. A red hue indicates hastiness, for all parts of the body on being heated by movement turn red. A flaming skin, however, indicates mania, for it results from an overheated body, and extreme bodily heat is likely to mean mania._ 

You’ll note, for example that Egypt (which is quite warm but also humid) somehow produces the melancholic temper which is supposedly hot and dry, while the cold (to a Greek, anyway) lands of the Gauls abounded in the hot and moist sanguine temperament. The whole approach to temperament and nationality generally seems like the ancient equivalent of pop psych: attaching poorly understood medical terms to very superficial observations.

In their defense, however, it should be pointed out that the Greeks generally regarded the influence of the humors as an inclination which could be resisted by the aid of reaso, discipline, and culture.

__And one outlier..,__ 

There's one other explanation, if you want to call it that. It did not seem particularly influential in antiquity but it's worth speculating in where it might have originated. Herodotus (3.101) says this in passing when discussing South Indian people:

> they are all black-skinned, like the Ethiopians. Their semen too, which they ejaculate into the women, is not white like other men's, but black like their skin, and resembles in this respect that of the Ethiopians.

Other ancient writers occasionally mocked Herodotus for passing on travellers’ tall tales. This certainly sounds like one of those!

__TLDR__ .

Skin color wasn’t really a primary phenomenon in Greek thinking; they noticed it and the did try to fit it into their general theories about the relationship between people and environment or the basics of human biology. However on the most important level it wasn’t really something they cared about.

Here’s a really remarkable example: Herodotus provides this very exacting description of Kushites or Nubians accompanying the Persian army during Xerxes’ invasion of Greece:

> The Ethiopians were wrapped in skins of leopards and lions, and carried bows made of palmwood strips, no less than four cubits long, and short arrows pointed not with iron but with a sharpened stone that they use to carve seals; furthermore, they had spears pointed with a gazelle's horn sharpened like a lance, and also studded clubs.

But despite this careful attention to detail… no mention of complexion at all unless you count “Aethiops.”
