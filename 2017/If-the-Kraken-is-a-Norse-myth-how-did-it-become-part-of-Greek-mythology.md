Sheer ignorance.



The presence of the Kraken goes back to the original 1981 Ray Harryhausen film. While I yield second place to no man in my admiration for Harryhausen, I can only regard this as a lapse in judgement.

The 1981 serpent-tailed Medusa is creative license, but the four armed creature from the black lagoon with a Norwegian moniker takes it _too far_ . It was the 80’s, so I fear this is the victory of cocaine over classics. It’s just a shame that the remake did not take the opportunity to right this historic crime.
