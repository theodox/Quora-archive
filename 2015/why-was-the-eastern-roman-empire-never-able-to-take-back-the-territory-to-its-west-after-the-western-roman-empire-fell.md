They tried pretty hard: the campaigns of [Belisarius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belisarius) in Italy and North Africa temporarily reunited most of the Mediterranean world under [Justinian I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I)

in the 6th century. However there were several strategic problems with the position that the Byzantines found themselves in:

To the east, the [Sasanian Empire](http://Sasanian Empire) was a serious threat, with a powerful military and a traditional goal of reaching the Mediterranean. In the Balkans, the [Avar Khaganate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avar_Khaganate) and the [Bulgars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgars) were constant threats as well. The Byzantines were perpetually on the defensive to the east and northeast, and there was no way to concentrated on the west without weakening these vital frontiers. 

The intense [religious controversies](http://www.earlychristianhistory.info/monoph.html) controversies of the 5th century had weakened the fabric of the Empire pretty significantly (the theological issues were highly technical but they ended up becoming proxies for ethnic opposition to Greek dominance in the empire). The eastern religious politics were also implicated in the selection of [Pope Silverius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Silverius) and his successor [Pope Vigilius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Vigilius), who was regarded as unpopular imperial flunky. For the next two hundred years the emperors would treat the papacy as more or less an appointive post, which was an unpopular position in the west diminished the support of Latin Christians for the program of the reconquest.

The barbarian rulers of the west -- in particular the Franks and the Ostrogoths -- were pretty canny. They played expertly on the religious/ethnic tensions between the Latin and Greek halves of the Empire. They aggressively courted the remnants of the local Roman aristocracy. They were less formal and legalistic -- but probably also less grasping and less efficient at extracting revenues -- than their Byzantine counterparts. They were pretty appealing as foreign occupiers go, and by the end of the 6th century the Greek speaking "Romans" from Constantinople were just as foreign. (Justinian is believed to be the last Emperor who spoke Latin as a first language). If the Ostrogoths has been good Catholics, instead of Arians, Theoderic might have been able to get himself appointed Augustus of the west in the old tradition.

Finally, the long wars in Italy seriously depleted the economic and manpower resources of the peninsula. The west was already underpopulated after more than a century of wars and plagues; after Belisarius was through with Italy it was a wreck and hardly a positive in the imperial balance sheet.
