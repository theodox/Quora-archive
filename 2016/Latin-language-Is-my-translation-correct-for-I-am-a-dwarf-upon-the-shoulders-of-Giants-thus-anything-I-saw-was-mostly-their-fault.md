Here's the earliest version of the original, courtesy of Bernard of Chartres

> Dicebat Bernardus Carnotensis nos esse quasi nanos, gigantium humeris insidentes, ut possimus plura eis et remotiora videre, non utique proprii visus acumine, aut eminentia corporis, sed quia in altum subvenimur et extollimur magnitudine gigantea.

To echo the original I'd try

> Quasi nanus sum, gigantium humerIs insidens. Ut possum videre aliquid, pleraque culpa illorum.

Literally "like a dwarf I am, upon the shoulders of giants resting; if I am able to see anything, of the blame the majority is theirs"

You could be a bit more direct in the second sentence 

> Ut possum videre aliquid, illos culpa

"If I am able to see anything, blame them"
