The first century was a pretty good time in the Mediterranean basin -- the end of the endemic civil wars of the late republic brought an enormous 'peace dividend', and the professionalization of Roman governance -- replacing ambitious politicians with imperial legates -- generally made life far better for provincials than it had been in a long time. 

So, it's not surprising that Herod's reign shows some impressive building projects. Herod was a very successful - albeit murderous - dynast, eager to show off his power as a top-tier Roman client and living in a boom time. However he spent more than he probably should have: part of the reason his reputation is so bad is the heavy-handed taxation he used to finance his projects.

_This model makes Herod's palace look pretty impressive, and according to Josephus it was a wonder. But there's a reason it is cut off from the rest of the city by big, defensible walls..._ 

Also, the Romans in this period didn't look kindly on the Jews. 
They were generally suspicious of any national-religious entity that was a focus for political opposition to Rome. The Romans were adept and patient at dealing with the venality of various petty chieftains, kinglets and tribal leaders -- but they didn't tolerate anything which smacked of principled opposition rather than opportunism: they suppressed the Druids in Gaul and the Jews in Judaea (and later, Manicheans and Christians) for the same reason. An able, but venal and ideologically flexible proxy like Herod was exactly what the Romans wanted -- if Herod has been more amenable to Jewish traditionalists the Romans would probably have replaced him. 

The first century saw a marked deterioration in relations between Jews and the Greco-Roman world. Roman arrogance and Jewish intransigence were a deadly combination: not only the disastrous [Judaean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War) in 66 and the [Kitos War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War) in 115, but also significant violence in the diaspora as well: Tiberius expelled Jews from the city of Rome in 19, and in Alexandria there were communal riots in in 37 (as attested by [Philo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo)), in 66 (in [Josephus)](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/pogrom-in-alexandria/) and a particularly gory outbreak in 115 which essentially wiped out the Jewish community of Egypt. During this period anti-Jewish literature seems to have circulated widely in the Greco-Roman world. "Backwater" is probably one of the nicest thing a Roman in this period would have said about Judaea.
