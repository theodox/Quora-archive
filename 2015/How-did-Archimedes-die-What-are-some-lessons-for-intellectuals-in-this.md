Marcellus tried to save Archimedes, even though he had organized important aspects of the defense of Syracuse. This was sort of like the ancient version of the post-WWII scramble to recruit Nazi rocket scientists. One lesson might be 'join the military-industrial complex'

Although maybe the real lesson for intellectuals is 'drop the pose'. Here's one account of how he died:



> [Archimedes] died in this fashion at the hands of one of the Romans. He was stooping down, drawing some diagram in mechanics, when a Roman came up and began to drag him away to take him prisoner. But he, being wholly intent at the time on the diagram, and not perceiving who was tugging at him, said to the man: “Stand away, fellow, from my diagram.” As the man continued pulling, he turned round and, realizing that he was a Roman, he cried, “Somebody give me one of my engines.” But the Roman, scared, straightway slew him, a feeble old man but wonderful in his works.

It doesn't matter how smart you think you are or how deep your thoughts are... it's a good idea to do what the man with the sword is telling you to.
