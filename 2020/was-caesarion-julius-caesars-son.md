Probably, but we can’t be __sure__ .

All of the actors in the political drama had their own reasons for staking the claims they did: Cleopatra, Antony, and Octavian all wanted to claim the mantle of Caesar for themselves, and Caesarion was a tool for accomplishing that goal.

Even Caesar himself, who never publicly acknowledged the boy, had reasons for playing both sides. Too close an association with the exotic foreign queen was politically toxic for him back home in Rome, so had his ghost-writer [Gaius Oppius ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Oppius)circulate pamphlets “proving” that he was not the father. On the other hand he was still dallying with the Queen, and he allowed her to name the boy after him — apparently after she came to Rome, too.

As a practical matter, the timing is right and Cleopatra had strong incentives not to fool around behind Caesars’ back. She’s also unlikely to have been too sentimental to have disposed of a child who clearly was not Caesar’s — she’d have had to have been pregnant when they first met for the child to be have a different father, unless she was prepared to risk having an affair while Caesar was still in Egypt at the head of his army. The timing _is_ a bit tight: Caesar arrived in Alexandria in September of 48 BC, and Caesarion seems to have been born in late June of 47 — but it’s far from impossible.

So, the likelihood is that he really was Caesar’s child — but thanks to Caesar’s political misgivings he remained a cipher.



_The following concerns the link included in the question. It’s not particularly connected to Caesarion._ 

_The link appears to imply that Jesus is actually some kind of folk memory of_ _[Antiochus I Soter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_I_Soter)_ _: a run of the mill though very successful Macedonian warlord._ 

_Presumably its the bog-standard I-have-Wikipedia-but-I-don’t-read-Greek thing of assuming that the title_ soter_, which we translate as_ “savior,” _was a one-off theological thing and not a routine piece of political puffery shared by — among others —_ _[Ptolemy I Soter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter)_ _,_ _[Eumenes II Soter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumenes_II)_ _,_ _[Attalus I Soter,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attalus_I)_ __ _[Demetrius I Soter,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_I_Soter)_ _[Menander I Soter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menander_I)_ _, and_ _[Titus Quinctius Flamininus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Quinctius_Flamininus)_ _. It might be better to translate it as “hero”, since that underlines how malleable it really is:_ 

_In any event, Antiochus is a_ lousy _candidate for the job of crypto-messiah: He came from a family that everybody in first Roman-era Judaea knew far better than they wanted to. Antiochus’ namesake and great-to-the-third grandson_ _[Antiochus IV](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/antiochus-the-madman/)_ _was the most hated man in Jewish history before Titus and Hitler came along. And_ his _title was_ Epiphanes, “the god made manifest”_— proof that if you have enough spears you can call yourself any damn thing and get away with it._ 

_He also married his stepmom. Though at least it got turned into_ _[an actual opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratonice_(opera))_ _, instead of just a soap opera._ 

_The notion that somebody from_ that _family was quietly recycled as the Jewish Messiah is… goofy. It’s like proclaiming that Angela Davis is really just a recycled memory of Jefferson Davis._ 

_And after all_ _[, there’s no need to concoct some kind of AD/BC system if you’re already using a calendar based on your savior’s career](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_era)_ _— in this case, it was Antiochus’ dad Seleucus I’s sneaky capture of Babylon in 312 BC, which initiated the Minyan Sheṭarot, the “era of contracts” which was still being used by some Jewish communities until about 200 years ago. Hell, literally_ in the Bible (_the Catholic version, anyway)_ : _the Book of Maccabees uses the Seleucid dating system to recount all the bad things Antiochus IV did to the Jews. And of course everybody in the ancient near east knew about_ Antioch _(modern Antakya, Turkey), founded by Seleucus I and the_ third largest city in the Roman world_after Rome and Alexandria._
