I haven’t tried [Trnio](http://www.trnio.com/) but it looks promising.

If your can stomach a PC app, you can try the free version of [Agisoft PhotoScan](http://www.agisoft.com/) to see if it works for you; if you like it the basic version sells for $179. It’s the ‘prosumer’ option - it’s what a lot of graphics pros use when they don’t want to shell out for a complete studio solution
