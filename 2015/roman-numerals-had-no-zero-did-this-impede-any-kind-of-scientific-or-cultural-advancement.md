If you're a layman, the amount of mechanical work needed to do the same calculation is slightly greater, and there are some shortcuts that you can do in decimal math that are hard do with roman numerals. However if all you care about is getting the right numbers back -- how many boards to I need to build this bridge? How much more will I get if increase the tax rate from one part in twenty to one part in 19? -- you'll be able to get a correct answer. 

If you're a professional -- an accountant or an engineer -- you probably use an abacus in any case. This is essentially place-based math (they had abaci for different bases as well, such as base 12 for inches and base 60 for angular calculations). In this case, the difference is mostly one of convenience -- it is certainly nicer to have your work on paper where you can double check it, but the results are good and many of the same concepts (such as logarithms) are available .

There are a bunch of related questions: [How did the Romans pull off great construction projects using their Roman Numeral number system?](https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Romans-pull-off-great-construction-projects-using-their-Roman-Numeral-number-system), [How did Greeks and Romans do arithmetic?](https://www.quora.com/How-did-Greeks-and-Romans-do-arithmetic), and [History of Mathematics: How did the Ancient Romans teach their youth to add and subtract in Roman numerals](https://www.quora.com/History-of-Mathematics-How-did-the-Ancient-Romans-teach-their-youth-to-add-and-subtract-in-Roman-numerals-What-were-the-shortcuts-in-this-method-to-allow-for-mental-math)

Since the last one flew by I found a really neat article on Roman abacus design: [Ancient Computers](http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Ancient_Computers), with a great explanation of the cool tricks possible with a counting board like the [Salamis Tablet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salamis_Tablet):
