There are really two different things going on here at the same time; they reinforce each other but they're distinct. They're also primarily specific to an English speaking audience: if you were asking this question on a Chinese, Arabic, Hindi or Farsi version of Quora the answer would be quite different.

__Source materials__ 

The attrition rate for almost any cultural material before the spread of printing is _unbelievably_ bad: the vast. the overwhelming majority of ancient authors and their works are lost to us. Even among the familiar Greek and Roman works we know the names of hundreds of poets, historians and philosophers who exist only as names mentioned in passing or as the authors of short fragmentary paraphrases: To pick an example at random, the famous Greek natural philosopher [Democritus](http://Democritus) — the man who coined the word 'atom' and is sometimes known as the 'first scientist' — is attested only in a handful of second-hand paraphrases by later authors; we don't even have Aristotle's critique of Democritus except as a fragmentary quotation.

For cultures which didn't produce a lot of literary material, the net result is oblivion.

This is just as true of European as of non-European cultures: 19th century scholars tried mightily to discover a literary pedigree for non-classical European languages, particularly German, but the lack of native sources made the task almost impossible. It's almost certain, given the years of close proximity, extensive trade contacts, and the spread of Roman culture over the Rhine and the Danube that some Marcoman or Herule or Goth wrote a history of his own people and their traditions, but the vagaries of time have wiped it away leaving generations of German historians to rely on Tacitus' _[Germania](http://Germania)_ __ and Jordanes' _[Getica](http://Getica)_ __ which are clearly less than ideal sources (and which certainly reflect a Roman rather than a German point of view). The massive [Monumenta Germaniae Historica](http://Monumenta Germaniae Historica) — the authoritative collection of documents of early German history — is edited in Latin; most of its early contents are Latin as well. You need to keep a _lot_  of records in a pre-printing society for much to reach us. This leaves lots of smaller societies — or those that had bad luck in the matter of preservation — almost mute.

__Cultural transmission__ 

But of course there are other issues to consider when there _are_  records. And plenty of civilizations outside of the Mediterranean left lots of records.

Here on Quora, at least, "we" all speak English — so we inherit the literary and historical background of English to some degree, even if we've never set foot in the British Isles. And that tradition has deep connection to the Greco-Roman world rather than, say, to the culture of Babylon, Carthage or Pharaonic Egypt.

So even where there is a lot of source material (as there is for Egypt and the Near East) it's often too unfamiliar and too academic to make its way into the realm of common knowledge. Most school kids in the English-speaking world will have heard of the Greek gods or Julius Caesar — but not many non-specialists will recognize the names of [Marduk](http://Marduk) and [Inanna](http://Inanna) or [Urukagina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urukagina) even though these are all extremely well documented and easily available to anyone who's curious.

Most English speakers can at least recognize Egyptian art and a handful of big names (Isis and Horus, Rameses and King Tut) but Egyptian mythology and history are mostly graphical motifs for us — not many anecdotes or characters have filtered into popular culture. "Hercules" is a common synonym for "strong man"; "Venus" (or "Aphrodite", if you're going a bit up-market) are unremarkable in conversational English. But if you call a football player "as strong as Enkidu" almost nobody will know what you're talking about. This isn't just an in-group thing for British public school kids - there's a [Venus Wedding Planners](http://Venus Wedding Planners) in Hong Kong, but no entries for [Hathor](http://Hathor).
 
That over-representation of Greco-Roman references reflects the way the past gets handed down. It's worth pointing out that __the last century is the first in the history of the English language where a person can be regarded as 'educated' and yet have no familiarity with Latin__ .

__Cross-connections__

_An Italian, not an English manucript — but plenty of Medieval readers would recognize the reference in the 1340's copy of the_ ___Roman de Troie.___ 

The intertwining of English and the Greco-Roman culture goes way, way back. Chaucer, for example, wrote about the Trojan War, Aeneas, and the founding of Rome; of Alexander he wrote

> _ALEXANDER's tale is so well known a tune_ 
_That everyone who is not simple grown_ 
_Has heard somewhat, or all, of his fortune_ 
_This whole wide world, to state conclusion known,_ 
_He won by strength, or else for his renown_ 
_Right gladly men to sue for peace did send._ 
_The pride of man and beast he tumbled down_ 
_Where'er he went, and that was the world's end._ 

_(Monk's Tale)_ 

But even before English _was_ a language, its ancestors were still connected directly to the Roman (and thus the Greek) heritage as well. A proto-English poet like [Cynewulf](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Cynewulf-English-poet) in the 8th century could preface his tales with Emperor Constantine warring on the Goths in the name of Rome.

Even though England was a distant (and in Cynewulf's day, 300 years abandoned) outpost of Roman culture the connection with the old world was never lost entirely. After all, Latin remained the living language of law and religion throughout the Middle Ages and down to the 16th century.

_Dido and Aeneas having dinner in the_ _[Vergilius Romanus](http://Vergilius Romanus)_ _, an edition of Vergil's work illustrated in Britain in the 5th century_ 

That original ancestral connection has been refreshed several times. The Irish monks who preserved classical texts (including, unusually for Northern Europe, the ability to read Greek) brought their knowledge with them when they spread Christianity among the Angles, Saxons, Danes and other post-Roman conquerors of Britain. The Norman conquest brought not only a Romance language, but also French chivalric literature — which was itself steeped in re-clothed classical stories (that's where Chaucer got his [Troilus and Criseyde](http://Troilus and Criseyde))

Medieval scholarship was deeply indebted to ancient thinkers, particularly to Aristotle. This was originally in Arab or Jewish translations of Greek originals but by the twelfth century Latin versions of Aristotle, [Claudius Ptolemy](http://Claudius Ptolemy), [Galen](http://Galen) and [Boethius](http://Boethius) (to name a few) were the regular textbooks for university students. And of course throughout this period 'literacy' in England meant primarily 'literacy _in Latin'._ A condemned criminal could avoid the death penalty by proving his literacy — not by reading a line of English, but rather a verse from the Latin Bible.

The Renaissance built on that existing foundation of Latin texts. Italian writers and historians rediscovered large portions of Roman literature that had been preserved but rarely consulted (it's not an accident that the prestige of Roman antiquity, in particular, was very high at a time when Italians were the richest people in Europe; you can bet that the prestige of Chinese classics will probably be wider spread in the next century than it was in the last). Chaucer could read about Alexander from Petrarch; Shakespeare had such exposure that he could not only write about Caesar or Coriolanus but could expect an audience full of semi-literate groundlings to at least know who they were and to get a joke like

> CASSIUS: Did Cicero say any thing?
CASCA: Ay, he spoke Greek.
CASSIUS: To what effect?
CASCA: Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face again: but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own part, it was Greek to me.

Greek learning actually came rather late — it wasn't until the 16th century that it became common in England — but the thorough intertwining of Greek and Roman culture during the Roman empire meant than much Greek material was already present in Latin translation. However the Reformation's intense focus on the literal words of the Bible, made Greek (the language of the New Testament) a matter of very current interest. The unlocking of Greek histories and political works had a big impact on early modern English political thought : it's impossible to imagine Hobbes without Thucydides, or Locke without Polybius.

Finally of course, there's the pervasive impact of classical education on the the 18th and 19th centuries: particularly its impact on the the language itself. It's hard to give voice to any systematic thought in English without using words borrowed from Greek and Latin: how can you think in English without _philosophy, science,_  _religion, poetry, art, mathematics_ or _literature —_ all of which are Greek or Latin borrowings?

__TLDR__ 

Those centuries of interaction are really why Greek and Roman subjects are so much more present to "us" than Persian or Arabic or Chinese or Hindi ones. That historical baggage counts for far more because it's unconscious: professionals devote a lot of time to stepping outside their inherited frame of reference but most people don't bother. "We" see antiquity through a Greco-Roman lens because "we" can't help it; it's baked into many layers of our language from the vocabulary to things like this:

Of course, random walk through a bookstore in Shanghai or Mumbai will turn up a very different set of histories and literary references. The viewpoint of somebody who learned English as a second language for technical or business purposes will also be very different.
