No. The farthest south of Egypt the Romans got in force was [Napata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napata), in what was then (~ 22 BC) the kingdom of [Meroe](http://www.ancient.eu/Meroe/). That was part of an inconclusive war which ended in a peace treaty — for the next three centuries Meroe was generally a Roman ally and trading partner.

_This map shows the relative relations, although not borders._ 

Trade and cultural interchange were pretty common* Over the next three centuries Meroe declined; it’s not obvious (we have almost no written material — we don’t even know what language family Meroitic belongs to) but it seems to be a combination of changing trade patterns, overfarming, and climate change.

Axum conquered Meroe in AD 330 or thereabouts, but by that point the once wealthy and vibrant kingdom was poorer and shrinking in population. Axum itself was part of the thriving [Indian Ocean trade network](https://www.quora.com/I-have-heard-that-ancient-Greece-and-Rome-were-having-trades-with-south-Indian-kingdoms-But-in-history-why-werent-these-given-much-importance-and-not-talked-about/answer/Steve-Theodore), and as such had considerable cultural contact with the Mediterranean world. But by the time the two empires became neighbors in the 4th century, the Roman world was on the permanent strategic defensive — the Romans had bigger things to worry about than the source of the Nile.

By the late fourth century, Christian Axum was generally allied with Rome, although as Monophysites the relationship had ups and downs that followed the torturous course of Byzantine religious controversies. Still, as trading partners and more-or-less coreligionists who shared an interest in keeping the Indian Ocean a friendly route they seem to have been more cooperative than competitive. The one time this seems to have become really important was in the sixth century when Axumite armies fought the Persians and their allies in the Arabian peninsula in a [complex proxy war over the Jewish-Arab kingdom of Himyar](http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/140366/himyar-yemen-al-qaida) ; the (Byzantine) Romans were [fighting the Persians in the Caucasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_War_of_572%E2%80%93591) at the same time, though we don’t know how much actual coordination was involved.



for example, in the Acts of the Apostles (8:27), written about a century after Augustus’ war, Philip the evangelist converts a eunuch belonging to ‘[the] Candace, the queen of Ethiopia” who was returning from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This isn’t called out as particularly remarkable on religious, cultural or racial grounds.
