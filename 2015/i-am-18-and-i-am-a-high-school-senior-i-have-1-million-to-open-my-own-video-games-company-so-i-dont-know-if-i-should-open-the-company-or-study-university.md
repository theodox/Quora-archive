# I am 18 and I am a high school senior, I have €1 million to open my own video games company. So I don't know if I should open the company or study university, and I can't do both at the same time. I just can choose one, so what do I need to choose?

As [Jimmy Wales](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jimmy-Wales) said, if you're not sure, that's a sign the idea is not ready. That's OK, but it means you're talking investment strategies and not founding Apple in your garage based on a radical idea nobody else has had.

In that context, a million Euros isn't enough to fund an 'investment grade' game company. It's enough to make an indie game, but an indie game is a passion project, not an investment strategy: investing your million in that is like investing it in your rock band or your career as a pro footballer. It _might_  work. But probably not.

Your million is a great advantage, however: it will allow you to do what many less fortunate people can't do: take some risks with your timeline.

If you think a career in games is what you want to do, you can afford to start your own indie project as an experiment and see if you like it. Unlike most 18 year olds, you can spend a couple of years trying and still fall back to a conventional college education if (a) it does not work out or (b) it turns out making games is less fun than you expected. 

That's a huge gift. But it's __not__ a money making investment - it's a self-taught education. As long as you live like any other 18-year-old indie developer -- that is, as long as you forget that million is there, live cheap and see what you can do _without_ the cash cushion -- it's also safe bet: if you go back to school at 20, with that million still in the bank but two years of self-starting entrepreneurship and real world experience behind you, you'll get a lot more out of college than you would just following the well-beaten path.
