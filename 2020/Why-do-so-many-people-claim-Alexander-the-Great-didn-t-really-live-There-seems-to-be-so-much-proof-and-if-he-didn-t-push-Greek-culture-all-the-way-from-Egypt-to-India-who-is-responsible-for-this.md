# Why do so many people claim Alexander the Great didn’t really live? There seems to be so much proof and if he didn’t push Greek culture all the way from Egypt to India who is responsible for this?

Why? It’s not exactly “haters gonna hate,” but it’s close.

Unfortunately a lot of people interact with everything through n-th hand references. If you don’t have any regular contact with either the primary sources or reputable modern versions, you can’t easily distinguish between things that are simply unfamiliar, things that professional scholars argue about, and things that are “fake olds” — the ancient version of fake news.

People who lack the necessary context sometimes veer off into extreme credulity (“Omigod we have to ban [dihydrogen monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrogen_monoxide_parody) right away!”) and sometimes they fall into extreme scepticism (“[Napoleon is nothing but a solar myth!”](https://archive.org/details/napoleonmythcont00evanuoft/page/n8/mode/2up)).

Sometimes its just people who don’t quite know how to express themselves; they’re really asking a reasonable question but[ they phrase it in ways that make it seem like a conspiracy theory.](https://www.quora.com/Did-Alexander-the-Great-exist-What-evidence-proves-this)

Lastly, of course — and sometimes I think this is as big a category as the previous ones added up together — there are the trolls.

__For the record:__ Nobody who has any right to an opinion on the existence of Alexander the Great doubts his historicity. If somebody seems genuinely confused, it’s easy to set them straight. If, on the other hand, they positively and definitively claim that Alexander is a myth or something along those lines… don’t waste time trying to convince them. They’ve heard it all before (because it’s all so _freaking obvious)_ and clearly don’t want to hear differently. Like Flat Earthism, it’s either trolling or a low-grade mental illness; in either case you’re not gonna fix it for them.
