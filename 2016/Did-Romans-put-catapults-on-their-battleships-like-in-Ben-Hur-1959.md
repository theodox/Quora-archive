Actually that scene has a _glaring_  anachronism, but its not technological.

At the time of the movie, Macedonia had been a Roman territory for more than a century and a half. The last notable fleet action in Roman waters happened in the days of Judah/Charlton Hesston’s grandparents. The Mediterranean would be peaceful for another three hundred years to come. Sorry, Jack Hawkins, there's not a lot of adventure on the high seas of the first century.

That said , catapults were pretty old technology by the time of _Ben Hur_ . They seem to have evolved out of outsized bows during the wars between Greek and Carthaginian settlers in Sicily, sometime around 400 BC , four centuries before the timeframe of the movie. Alexander the Great made the first known use of naval artillery in the [Siege of Tyre](http://www.ancient.eu/article/107/) in 332 BC, mounting catapults on his galleys attack the heavily fortified island city.

Over the next couple of centuries warships got bigger, heavier and slower to accommodate a range of equipment; the daring, balletic sea-fights of [Phormio ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phormio)gave way to slugging matches based on head-on ramming and infantry battles between marines across the decks of grappled galleys. Rome, in particular, was fond of heavier and stouter ships — probably because the land-lubbing Romans were frequently matched against Carthaginian fleets with more skilled sailors and admirals. The classical Athenian trireme of the 5th century BC was about 70 tons displacement; a Roman [quinquereme ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic-era_warships#Quinquereme)(not the largest class!) was more like 100 tons and carried about twice the crew. We don't really know how big the larger ships were, though we know that they were quite substantial, with ten feet of freeboard and armored fighting “castles” — and were correspondingly sluggish under oars. This bulk, of course, made it easier to mount artillery. The slower pace of the heavy ships made missile weapons relevant.

So: yes, it was pretty common for Roman galleys to mount artillery though most of it was intended to kill sailors and marines rather than to sink ships. A ballista — essentially a giant bow, although using twisted sinews rather than flexible arms to provide torsion — could throw either spear-like bolts or round cannonball-like stones; the first would be more accurate but the latter more damaging. The vertical arm stone thrower — what most people think of as a catapult, although more properly its an _[onager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onager_(weapon))_ _—_  could throw a heavier ball a longer distance: but it was less accurate and put a lot of strain on the ship’s timbers: it got its Latin name from the word for ‘wild donkey’ because of its powerful and unpredictable kick.

It’s less well known that Roman galleys also mounted special engineering equipment:

The [corvus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvus_(boarding_device)) or “crow”, a specially hinged boarding ramp with deck-piercing “beak” that could be pivoted and dropped onto an enemy deck

the [harpax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpax), a ballista which fired grappling hooks rather than stones and was used to drag an enemy ship into boarding range

The [sambuca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambuca_(siege_engine)), a scaling ladder mounted on an improvised catamaran-quinquereme, designed to allow amphibious assaults directly against the walls of an enemy city.

__PS__ : Not quite on topic, but rewatching that scene I realized that the Heston’s ship is a trireme, ie, it has three men to an oar. That would be the second-lowest sized warship in that era, and I don’t think there are examples of ships that small with fighting castles and missile weapons.
