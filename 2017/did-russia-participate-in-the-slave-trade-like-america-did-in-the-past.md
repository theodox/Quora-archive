Russia’s history is deeply entwined with the trade in slaves.

The [Kievan Rus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan_Rus%27) — the originally-Norse rulers of what eventually became Russia — were major slave traders. They dispatched a steady stream of captives to the slave markets of the Black Sea or the Volga river— part of the reason that “slave” and “Slav” share an etymology in languages all over Europe and the Middle East. The Arab traveler [Ahmad ibn Fadlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_ibn_Fadlan) described [his time among Rus slave dealers on the Volga](http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/ibn_fdln.shtml) in the early 900’s (an account that was very, very, _very_  fictionalized into the movie _[The 13th Warrior](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120657/)_ ). After about the year 1000 the city-state of [Novgorod ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novgorod_Republic#Economy)also began capturing slaves in Finland.

Later on — particularly after the fall of the Byzantine empire in 1453 — Russia became large _involuntary_ exporter of slaves. The Mongols and especially the Crimean Tatars were aggressive slave-hunters; the wide, indefensible frontiers to the south and west of Russian territory were ideal terrain for catching slaves. The Black Sea slave port of [Caffa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feodosia) — infamous for being the place that introduced the Black Plague to Europe — was also one of the largest slave markets in the world, probably bigger than any individual African market before 1700.[ Women were the most prized targets](https://mikedashhistory.com/2015/01/15/blonde-cargoes-finnish-children-in-the-slave-markets-of-medieval-crimea/): fair-skinned women fetched the best prices in Ottoman markets.

[For most of the 15th, 16th and 17th century Russia participated in the slave trade as both an importer and a victim](http://Slave Trade in the Early Modern Crimea From the Perspective of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish Sources (https://www.academia.edu/2971600/Slave_Trade_in_the_Early_Modern_Crimea_From_the_Perspective_of_Christian_Muslim_and_Jewish_Sources)). The last great slave raid against Russian territory was made in 1769.

Agricultural slavery was a major part of Russian life until the 1670’s when agricultural slaves were converted into serfs. Domestic slavery survived until 1723 when Peter the Great converted that, too, into serfdom. However [m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Russia)[ost Russian slaves were Russian,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Russia) not foreign; they were often poor people who sold themselves into slavery when they had no other recourse.
