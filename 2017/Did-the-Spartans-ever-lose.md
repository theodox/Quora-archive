They did. Their reputation for invincibility, like a lot of reputations, included an element of myth-making. Thermopylae, the battle which gave us the legend of the 300 facing down the entire Persian army, was a defeat after all, albeit an epic one.

_An Athenian war souvenir, taken from the Spartans who surrendered at_ _[Pylos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pylos)_ _in 425 BC. But, as a mixed land-naval battle, this “didn’t count” against the Spartans’ reputation._ 

During the great confrontation with Athens (the [Peloponnesian War](http://www.ancient.eu/Peloponnesian_War/), 460–404 BC) they lost several important battles, though they never lost what the Greeks considered a “real” fight — the head-to-head clash of hoplite armies in the open field. However within another generation their reputation for invincibility was destroyed forever on the field of [Leuctra](http://www.ancient.eu/Battle_of_Leuctra/) (371 BC) when the brilliant Theban general [Epaminondas](http://www.ancient.eu/Epaminondas/) led the Thebans to a crushing victory over the Spartans which nobody could dismiss. This was followed up with another, narrower victory at [Mantinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mantinea_(362_BC)).

After these two defeats Sparta —which, thanks to its inflexible social order, always had trouble filling the ranks of its elite army — went into long term decline. It remained one of the leading Greek cities but it was increasingly irrelevant after the age of Alexander the Great, when larger kingdoms and alliances dominated Greek politics. Sparta finally lost its independence in[ a brief, lopsided war against Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_against_Nabis) in 195 BC.
