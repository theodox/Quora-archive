It's an interesting definitional question, both for evaluating Sulla and for how you use the word _tryant._ He was certainly a nasty fellow (see [Did Sulla commit murders?](https://www.quora.com/Did-Sulla-commit-murders) ) but "tyrant" has a particular meaning in antiquity. 

How would you categorize Augusto Pinochet or Francsco Franco ? 

Like Sulla, both forcibly overthrew their legitimate governments and were willing to use force against their political enemies. And, again like Sulla they both planned for a transition to a more orderly, civilian form of government (Sulla and Pinochet retired; Franco held on to power until his death).

If you are wondering if Sulla would be regarded as a tyrant in antiquity, the answer is probably not. The Greek word _tyrannos_ had a particular connotation in ancient political theory : tyranny was not merely a form of illegitimate personal rule but rather a form of monarchy in which the tyrant posed as the protector of the lower classes against the powerful: a tyrant was a _populist_ autarch, and Sulla was definitely not a populist. In this regard also he resembles Franco and Pinochet as a successful reactionary revolutionist. 

Interestingly, classical political theory didn't really have a special word or category for the reactionary strongman or _caudillo_ , who ruled in defiance of the law but in the interest of the propertied classes. Fear of tyranny in the ancient world focused on the renegade aristocrat who would betray his social class in pursuit of personal power: perhaps because 'playing by the rules' was such an important aspect of aristocratic self image, the notion that the rules would be broken by a reactionary was not a common one (although there were definitely some examples in practice, the most infamous being [Scipio Nasica Serapio,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Cornelius_Scipio_Nasica_Serapio_(consul_138_BC))who organized the murders of the Tiberius Gracchus whom he accused of aiming at tyranny).
