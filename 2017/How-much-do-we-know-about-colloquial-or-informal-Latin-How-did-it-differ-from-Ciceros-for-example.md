# How much do we know about colloquial (or informal) Latin? How did it differ from Cicero's, for example?

Pretty much by definition, we don’t know a whole lot about it; our literary sources (at least before about the 4th century) come from the upper end of the Roman scale and usually reflect a pretty self-conscious form of elite expression, heavily influenced by Greek and by aristocratic self presentation. We’re in the position of people trying to understand language in contemporary America reading only academic monographs.

We do have some hints to work from, however.

One interesting source is a fun list of common mis-spellings and malformations, known as the [Appendix Probi](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kurisuto/germanic/appendix_probi.html) from the third or fourth century. It which gives a good example of the verbal delta between proper and common Latin, and also shows clear signs of the way Latin morphed into the later Romance languages. Here’s a few examples to get the flavor (the ‘proper’ way comes first):

_avus (“bird”) non aus
miles (“soldier”) non milex
masculus (“male”) non mascel
barbarus (“barbarian”) non barba
fames (“rumors”) non famis_ 

Some of these are slangy shortenings (_barba_ ), some are solecisms (_milex_ ). Some show the gradual breakdown of the complex case and declensions (_fames_  turning into _famis_  as if it had the i-stem). You’ll also catch a lot of informal diminutives, such as _anucla_  or _anucula_  for _anus_ and _oricla_ for _auris._ We know that some slang involved attempts at sounding erudite: Catullus, for example, [makes fun of somebody for pronouncing Commodus as Chommodus ](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Catullus_84)to make it sound more Greek.

_Some of the more presentable grafitti from Pompeii_ 

[Grafitti from Pompeii](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10336768/What-can-we-learn-from-Roman-graffiti.html) and other Roman sites give a similar picture of a simpler, less regulated, informal Latin — the one which ultimately formed the basis of modern Romance languages. Less well educated writers tended to lose final consonants, for example, which suggests that they ended a lot of words with a general nasal honk rather than a sonorous Latin “-um” or “-us”; that sets the stage for the the modernization of Latin _maximum_ into Italian _massimo_ and so on_._ Pompeiians also seem to missed vowel distinctions that the better-off preserved in writing — the process that turned Latin _hodie_ into Spanish _hoy._ Pompeii also also shows some confusion about grammatical gender, such as (masculine) _cadaver mortuus_  for (neuter) _cadaver mortuum_ “dead body” — in modern Romance languages the neuter gender has mostly disappeared as it does here.

One more good source of insight into the language of ordinary Romans comes along in the fourth and fifth centuries. Early Christian writers tended to be more more interested in addressing the commoners than their pagan predecessors had been; pagan controversialists loved to harp on the Christians’ non-classical writing style. So popular devotional literature like saints’ lives provides a view of deliberately “popular” literature that’s missing in earlier eras; Saint Augustine, for example, was a very well educated Ciceronian in his private life, but he was willing to put out [sing-song rhymes](http://www.augustinus.it/latino/salmo_contro_donato/) to get his point across to the masses (another change that stands out strongly in early Christian writing is the use of stresses rather than vowel quantity in poetic meter). The Latin [Vulgate Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate) shows the the process of popularization coming almost full circle, since it’s a work of sophisticated scholarship that at the same time is very deliberately streamlined in both grammar and vocabulary.

When it comes to usage, our information isn’t very full. There’s a vast amount we don’t know, particularly before the fourth century. We do have some hints; for example Cicero himself admitted that he dropped his tone in his correspondence:

> verum tamen quid tibi ego videor in epistulis? nonne plebeio sermone agere tecum? nec enim semper eodem modo. quid enim simile habet epistula aut iudicio aut contioni? quin ipsa iudicia non solemus omnia tractare uno modo. privatas causas et eas tenuis agimus subtilius, capitis aut famae scilicet ornatius ; epistulas vero cotidianis verbis texere solemus.

> But, after all, what do you think of my style in letters? Don't I talk with you in the plebeian tongue? Why, of course one doesn't write always in the same style. For what analogy has a letter with a speech in court or at a public meeting? Nay, even as to speeches in court, it is not my practice to handle all in the same style. Private causes and such as are of slight importance we plead in simpler language; those that affect a man's civil existence or reputation, of course, in a more ornate style: but letters it is our custom to compose in the language of everyday life.

[Epistulae ad Familiares](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Cic.+Fam.+9.21&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0009) 9.21

You can catch a couple of “plebeianisms” or _plebeio sermone:_ for example _nonne plebeio sermone agere tecum,_ literally “don’t I make with the plebeian tongue with you,” using _agere_  in the broad way a Frenchman would use _faire_ or an Italian _fa._ Since his correspondence was written for him by his secretary, it doesn’t show the misspellings which show up Probus, but it definitely has a different rhythm and vocabulary than his philosophical treatises and oratory. You’ll also notice that none of these sentences are 10-line multi-clause monsters; one thing that seems pretty sure is that ordinary Romans were [unwilling to wait for 139 words to get to the verb](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Romans-of-antiquity-speak-with-adjectives/answer/Steve-Theodore).

Some scholars treat the plays of [Plautus](http://www.unrv.com/culture/plautus.php), particularly the language of his slaves, as a proxy for informal Latin. To some degree that’s because of his subject matter, and to some degree because he’s an older writer than Cicero and Caesar (his career falls between the second and third Punic wars, about 150 years before Cicero) and we tend to assume that common speech was more conservative of older usage. Another frequently cited proxy is the [Satyricon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyricon) of Petronius, especially the famous scene featuring the nouveau-riche excess of [Trimalchio’s dinner.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimalchio) We have to be careful, though, since both of these examples are literary efforts to simulate ordinary speech: they are as close (or as far) from reality as, say, the stories of Damon Runyon are from the realities of Broadway.
