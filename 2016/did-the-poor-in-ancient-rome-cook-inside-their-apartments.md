Some did, but more did not. The risk of fire was always on the minds of Romans and many apartments didn’t have functional kitchens; a small brazier would be the most that a lot of ordinary people might have in their quarters. Running water was also a luxury for most people so both cooking and washing up were hard to do. An oven was a large and expensive installation, out of most people’s reach .

You could of course keep prepared food at home of some kinds: bread, cheese, olive oil, dried fruit, smoked fish or sausage, to name a few items — so the house would not be completely without food. For most people, though, hot meals would come from the local [thermopolium](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/thermopolium.html) or [popina](https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/lucius-romans/2016/07/15/visiting-a-bar-in-ancient-rome/).

_Like modern urbanites, Romans lived in small flats and ate out a lot._
