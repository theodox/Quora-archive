Human sacrifices was regarded as an aberration, and it was rare. But it wasn’t unheard of.

In historic Greece and Rome, human sacrifice only surfaced in moments of great crisis, when a popular mood was verging on hysteria. The most famous Greek example comes from the darkest part of the Persian invasion (and [Plutarch’s version of the story](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Themistocles*.html) also conveys the more common attitude).

> Themistocles was sacrificing alongside the admiral's trireme. There three prisoners of war were brought to him, of visage most beautiful to behold, conspicuously adorned with raiment and with gold. They were said to be the sons of Sandaucé, the King's sister, and Artaÿctus. When Euphrantides the seer caught sight of them, since at one and the same moment a great and glaring flame shot up from the sacrificial victims and a sneeze gave forth its good omen on the right, he clasped Themistocles by the hand and bade him consecrate the youths, and sacrifice them all to Dionysus Carnivorous, with prayers of supplication; for on this wise would the Hellenes have a saving victory. Themistocles was terrified, feeling that the word of the seer was monstrous and shocking; but the multitude, who, as is wont to be the case in great struggles and severe crises, looked for safety rather from unreasonable than from reasonable measures, invoked the god with one voice, dragged the prisoners to the altar, and compelled the fulfilment of the sacrifice, as the seer commanded.

_Themistocles XIII.2_ 

The most notorious Roman example, likewise, happened when Hannibal was literally at the gates in the aftermath of the Roman disaster at Cannae:

> by the direction of the Books of Fate, some unusual sacrifices were offered; amongst others a Gaulish man and woman and a Greek man and woman were buried alive in the Cattle Market, in a place walled in with stone, which even before this time had been defiled with human victims — a sacrifice wholly alien to the Roman spirit.

_[Livy, XXII.57](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0152%3Abook%3D22%3Achapter%3D57)_ 

Caesar, who described human sacrifices among the Gauls, remarked the general attitude — this was a practice for times of crisis:

> those who are greatly affected by diseases and in the dangers of battle either sacrifice human victims or vow to do so using the Druids as administrators to these sacrifices, since it is judged that unless for a man’s life a man’s life is given back, the will of the immortal gods cannot be placated.

[Gallic War: VI.16](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Caesar/Gallic_War/6B*.html)

Most of the time, though, governments and ordinary citizens regarded the practice with horror: when “barbarians” like Caesar’s Gauls (or Carthaginians, Scythians, Germans, or Britons) practiced human sacrifice it was seen as proof that these peoples were in need of some forcible civilizing. Both Greek and Roman statesmen preened themselves on having forced their defeated enemies to give up the practice at swordpoint.

Nonetheless, the idea of human sacrifice presented a challenge for Greek and Roman society. To some degree these actions, though very unusual, reflected the logic implied in traditional sacrificial ‘transactions’ with the gods. An offer of a fine bull is a more valuable and thus more likely to entice the favor of a god than a measly chicken or a few honey cakes. Wouldn’t an even _more_  valuable offering be even more likely to attract the favor of the gods?

There are a lot of myths from pre-historic Greece (less so in Rome) which reflect this tension, and the hold it still had on Greeks thought long after it was no longer practiced on a regular basis. You can see the ambiguity in the many variants of familiar stories; for example in some retellings [Iphigenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia) voluntarily embraced her own sacrifice for the sake of her nation — but in others her sacrifice was an elaborate mirage and the gods miraculously spirited her away, safe from harm.

The tension didn’t only exist in myths: [Plutarch reports](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pelopidas*.html) that the Theban commander Pelopidas dreamed on the eve of the crucial battle of [Leuctra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leuctra) that a human sacrifice would ensure his victory. He recoiled, but when he reported his dream to the soothsayers in his army opinion was strongly divided, with precedents cited on both sides. As the debate raged on a beautiful horse wandered by from a nearby herd and Pelopidas chose to see this as an omen: he sacrificed the horse, and won the battle. The story shows, however, that a generation after the death of Socrates human sacrifice remained a temptation that had to be actively resisted in a moment of tension.

Not everybody did resist. _Unofficial,_ illegal human sacrifices continued on a small scale in the shadowy margins of Greek and Roman society. Plato, for example, repeats what you might describe as an urban legend about [rumored human sacrifices performed in his own era in Arcadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lykaia)* ([a legend which has recently been revived](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/10/skeletal-remains-confirm-ancient-greeks-engaged-in-human-sacrifice) by some archaeological discoveries). The Roman natural historian Pliny remarks in passing that human sacrifices had been performed at Rome in his own era — though elsewhere he is clearly scandalized by the practice among non-Romans. In this connection it’s significant that [he reports the law which banned human sacrifice](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D30%3Achapter%3D3) as the part of a discussion not of religion but of magic and witchcraft:

> At last, in the year of the City 657 [=97 BC] , Cneius Cornelius Lentulus and P. Licinius Crassus being consuls, a decree forbidding human sacrifices was passed by the senate; from which period the celebration of these horrid rites ceased in public, and, for some time, altogether.

_XXX.3_ 

Horace’s [Epode V](http://nonnumadanda.blogspot.com/2011/02/horace-epode-5.html) is a lurid description of witches ritually murdering a young boy to use his organs in a love potion.

Some notable real-life criminal cases suggest that human sacrifice continued to be practiced privately, as form of “black magic” — illegal and stigmatized. It was widely believed, for example, that the murder of [Germanicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanicus) was [accompanied by magical attacks including curse tablets and human sacrifices](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D69). The revolutionary conspiracy of Catiline was [believed to have been sealed with an illicit sacrifice as well.](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0124%3Achapter%3D22)

So: human sacrifice was not a routine part of Greco-Roman life or religion, but it did exist at the margins: among social outcasts and foreigners, but also among the great powers in moments of extreme crisis.



* There’s [another dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos_(dialogue)) which is attributed to Plato but probably not actually his work in which this connection is made very explicit.
