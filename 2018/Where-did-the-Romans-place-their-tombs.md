Typically outside the city walls along the major roads leading in to town. Highly visible locations were important — aristocratic families wanted the their tombs, which were advertisements for the wealth and influence of the family — to be visible to anyone entering the city.

Roman tradition involved [annual visits to the family tomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parentalia). some mausoleums were built with bedrooms and kitchens to support an extended stay. Locations closer to the city were prized as they cut down on the travel needed to perform the graveside rites.

Very poor people were buried in [catacombs,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombs_of_Rome) networks of tunnels cut into the soft volcanic rock outside the city. These tombs were much cheaper — though of course they lacked the social display of the prominent above-ground memorials.
