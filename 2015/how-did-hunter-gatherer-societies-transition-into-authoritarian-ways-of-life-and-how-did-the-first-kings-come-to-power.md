We don't really know for sure, and it's not clear that it happpened the same way everywhere. 

 The best documented evidence comes from Mesopotamia, and the outline of the story is interesting, because kingship arises notably later than urbanization. Mesopotamian cities -- particularly in [Sumer](http://Sumer) , the oldest settled part of the region, seem to have started off with temples as their biggest and most powerful institutions. Very early records (between 4000 and 3000 BC) show that the economy of these early cities was surprisingly centralized and bureaucratic (we know this because the Sumerians used [clay tablets](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wrtg/hd_wrtg.htm) -- much more durable than paper -- so we have lots of accounting data ).

 In this early era (the ["Uruk period"](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/uruk/hd_uruk.htm)) there is no evidence for kings. The most powerful institutions were the temples, which oversaw the irrigation projects and stockpiled grain and other commodities for centralized distribution. This leads some people to describe it a kind of idealized socialism, with low levels of inequality and central control of resources.

By around 3000 BC there are some important changes. There is some kind of long-term crisis -- scholars don't agree on exactly what it was -- which disrupts the temple-states. It may have been climate change, competition for resources and water rights (this period seems to have been very drought prone) or violent incursions from the outside (Mesopotamia is terrible terrain for defense, and was constantly being infiltrated from all directions). Whatever the cause, the [early Dynastic Period](http://www.ancient.eu/Early_Dynastic_Period_(Mesopotamia)/) saw much more conflict between the various cities and within them. 

As their world got more dangerous, Mesopotamian cities tended to rely more and more on permanent military leaders, drawn from the wealthier independent classes. We first hear about kings in archaeological sources around 2600 BC, with [Enmebaragesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enmebaragesi) , the lugal ("big man") of [Kish](http://Kish)

_A fragment of the_ _[tummal inscription](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.2.1.3#)_ _, the earliest archaeological evidence for a named king._ 

We don't have great documentation for exactly what happened -- the Sumerians and Akkadians didn't write 'history' the way we would want it -- but we do have literary sources that give a good idea. [Gilgamesh and Agga of Kish](http://www.piney.com/BabGilgAgga.html) which was probably written down around 2100 BC describes a war between Agga of Kish and the semi-legendary king Gilgamesh of Uruk. The events described probably happened around 2700 BC. It gives a pretty vivid picture of how the king had to try to organize the defense of the city:



> Envoys of Aga, the son of En-me-barage-si, came from Kish to Gilgamesh in Uruk [demanding submission]. Gilgamesh presented the issue before the elders of his city, carefully choosing his words: "There are wells to be finished, many wells of the Land yet to be finished; there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished, there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed. We should not submit to the house of Kish! Should we not smite it with weapons? 



The city council didn't want to fight:



> In the convened assembly, his city's elders answered Gilgamesh: "There are indeed wells to be finished, many wells of the Land yet to be finished; there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished, there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed. So we should submit to the house of Kish. We should not smite it with weapons! 


So Gilgamesh does an end-run around the city council and takes his case to the young men:



> In the convened assembly, his city's able-bodied men answered Gilgamesh: ""Standing on duty and sitting in attendance, escorting the king's son, and forever grasping the donkey's reins -- who has that much breath?", as the saying goes. You old men should not submit to the house of Kish! Should we young men not smite it with weapons?

> "The great gods created the structure of Uruk, the handiwork of the gods, and of E-ana, the house lowered down from heaven. You watch over the great rampart, the rampart which An founded, the majestic residence which An established. You are its king and warrior, an exuberant person, a prince beloved of An. When Aga comes, what terror he will experience! That army is small, and scattered at the rear. Its men will be incapable of confronting us."



And with their backing Gilgamesh organizes the defense of the city. In the story he defeats Agga and sends him away chastened. This clearly shows that the king's role was, in this early stage, mostly military -- it also shows that power was far from absolute at this early stage, since Gilgamesh has to basically organize the defense of the city through force of personality: he doesn't have a standing army or bureaucrats at his command.

_Gilgamesh killing a monstrous bull. His claim to rule was based largely on the fact that he was big, strong and brave_ 

Another thing which drove the evolution of kingship was class conflict. The early dynastic period also saw the emergence of a large class of powerful landowners with private estates independent of the communally administered temple lands (depending on your ideological bent this is either the end of the Sumerian socialist paradise -- or people finally freeing themselves from stifling theocratic-bureaucratic control). The wealthy and powerful often oppressed their neighbors, and many kings achieved power by posing as protectors of the common people against the powerful. The most famous example is [Urukagina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urukagina). His official records proclaimed his dedication to protecting the weak:



> 1. Since time immemorial, since life began, in those days, the head boatman appropriated boats, the livestock official appropriated asses, the livestock official appropriated sheep, and the fisheries inspector appropriated.... The shepherds of wool sheep paid a duty in silver on account of white sheep, and the surveyor, chief lamentation-singer, supervisor, brewer and foremen paid a duty in silver on account of young lambs. . . These were the conventions of former times!
2. When Ningirsu, warrior of Enlil, granted the kingship of Lagash to Urukagina, selecting him from among the myriad people, he replaced the customs of former times, carrying out the command that Ningirsu, his master, had given him.
3. He removed the head boatman from control over the boats, he removed the livestock official from control over asses and sheep, he removed the fisheries inspector from control....
4. He removed the silo supervisor from control over the grain taxes of the _guda_ -priests, he removed the bureaucrat responsible for the paying of duties in silver on account of white sheep and young lambs, and he removed the bureaucrat responsible for the delivery of duties by the temple administrators to the palace.
5. The... administrators no longer plunder the orchards of the poor. When a high quality ass is born to a _shublugal_ , and his foreman says to him, "I want to buy it from you"; whether he lets him buy it from him and says to him "Pay me the price I want!," or whether he does not let him buy it from him, the foreman must not strike at him in anger.
...
8. Urukagina solemnly promised Ningirsu that he would never subjugate the waif and the widow to the powerful.

_Urakugina's proclamation: sometimes called the first declaration of human rights_ 

This is a common motif in Mesopotamian literature, with an obvious parallel in Greek history where many cities became monarchies (under a '_tyrannos',_ a "tyrant") when a popular leader balanced off the commoners against the aristocracy.

Military power and (at least in theory) a commitment to protecting the poor were the two original keys of Mesopotamian kingship. Over time the office also aquired a divine aura: [Naram-Sin of Akkad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naram-Sin_of_Akkad) was the first king we know of who officially proclaimed himself to be a god, around 2250 BC.

_Naran-sin: He may be divine, but he still has to fight to keep his job._
