The “classic” satrapal system is attributed to Darius:

> [Darius] divided his dominions into twenty governments, called by the Persians satrapies;​1 and doing so and appointing governors, he ordained that each several nation should pay him tribute; to this end he united each nation with its closest neighbours, and, beyond these nearest lands, assigned those that were farther off some to one and some to another nation

[Herodotus III.89](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/3D*.html#89)

At least according to Herodotus, Darius organizational abilities were derided by some of his Persian contemporaries for being too much like the grubby monetary outlook of a tradesman — a few sentences after the above he writes:

> It is by reason of this fixing of tribute, and other like ordinances, that the Persians called Darius the huckster, Cambyses the master, and Cyrus the father; for Darius made petty profit out of everything, Cambyses was harsh and arrogant, Cyrus was merciful and ever wrought for their well-being.

It’s important to note that Herodotus’ lists of the satrapies don’t match precisely with the scanty Persian original sources ([Darius’s list in the Behistun Inscription includes 23 territories, ](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/behistun-persian-text/behistun-t-02/)but Herodotus gives 26) and the[ list of satrapies divided among Alexander’s generals after his death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Triparadisus#:~:text=The%20Partition%20of%20Triparadisus%20was,of%20Alexander's%20empire%20among%20themselves.) (32) . The Bible [refers in passing to 127 Persian provinces](https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/explore-the-bible/read/eng/KJV/Esth/1/1/). Thus, Herodotus’s information can’t be seen as completely authoritative. Nevertheless it’s the best we’ve got and reflects a contemporary view from the fifth century, fairly close in time to Darius’ reign.

For a detailed (if very academic) look the [Encyclopedia Iranica article](https://iranicaonline.org/articles/achaemenid-satrapies) is a good source. It illustrates the lack of a scholarly consensus about the real origins of the system.
