Unless your game hook is something that’s supposed to be extremely unique — if the appeal of your game was novelty — then maybe its a problem.

But most games aren’t novel. You’ll find a lot of answers here that tell you [game ideas don’t mean much](https://www.quora.com/search?q=game+ideas+nothing). There’s a lot more to a game than concept! Execution and polish matter a lot to the success of your game. So do marketing and the support of a community.

The short answer: the existence of other games in the same genre is pretty much a problem for every game. Don’t let it stop you — but do learn what you can from the the way people react to your competitors!
