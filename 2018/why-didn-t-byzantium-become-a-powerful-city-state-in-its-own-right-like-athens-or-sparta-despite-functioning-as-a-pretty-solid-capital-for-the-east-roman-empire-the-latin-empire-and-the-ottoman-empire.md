# Why didn’t Byzantium become a powerful city-state in its own right like Athens or Sparta despite functioning as a pretty solid capital for the East Roman Empire, the Latin Empire, and the Ottoman Empire?

Actually Byzantion was an independent city state for quite a long time. However, there were many rival powers who coveted the city’s strategic location, and the city was rarely left to prosper in peace.

The site was first colonized by settlers from the Greek city of Megara in 675 BC. The site was a well chosen — it was a crucial port along the route to the Black Sea, and in later years the city would become very prosperous thanks to its dominating position on this vital trade route.

In the early day of the city the __Thracians__ were a constant threat. Although they never captured the city they controlled the hinterland, and (like the other Greek states along the coast from Macedonia around to Bulgaria) their presence prevented the Greeks from expanding their coastal footholds. When Cyrus the Great brought his __Persian__ army to Europe in 513 BC, Byzantion was subjugated, and although it tried on several occasions to escape from Persian control it remained a Persian protectorate until the defeat of the Persian invasion of Greece in 480 (the capture of Byzantion by the Spartan prince Pausanias in 478 was the last land action of the Greek alliance before it fell apart).

Unfortunately the city didn’t get to enjoy its independence long. The __Athenians__ took over leadership of the struggle against Persia, but they quickly converted their anti-Persian alliance into an empire in all but name. Byzantion was one of the crown jewels of the Athenian league — despite all of her tribulations the city remained wealthy and was in the top tier of the Athenian tribute-lists. Unsurprisingly it was also a tempting target for the Spartans during the Peloponessian war: it changed hands three times during that conflict and ended the war under a Spartan garrison. But the economics of the cities location could not be denied — sitting astride the trade route that brought the Black Sea grain on which Athens depended, the city was captured yet again in the 380’s during the Athenian revival. It seems like the Byzantines themselves recognized the importance of the economic tie — they remained loyal Athenian allies for the next five decades.

It was Athenian money which helped the Byzantines resist the attack of the __Macedonians__  under Phillip in 339. However this brought Athens directly into conflict with Phillip, launching the war which ended at Chaeronea with Macedonia firmly in control of Greece. Within a few years Alexander was off to Persia — and the era when city-states decided their own fates was over.

Byzantion would remain a prosperous but politically insignificant town for the next six hundred years until Constantine saw the untapped potential of the site and rebuilt it as the New Rome in 330 AD.
