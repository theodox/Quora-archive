After the reign of Augustus the Romans periodically attempted to create a permanent border for the empire in areas where there were nearby societies that were potentially hostile. In northern Britain, along the Rhine, down the Danube, and in North Africa there were permanent defenses. This was sometimes, but not usually, an actual wall, more often a chain of watchtowers backed by larger fortifications. 

The fortifications primarily offered defense against small scale raiding rather than a solid, impenetrable boundary: the idea was to slow down potential adversaries rather than to force them into a major siege. In most places the _limes_  were manned by second-rate troops who lived permanently in the area; like the fortifications these were there to deter small scale raids or brigandage instead of fighting big invading armies. These troops (the _limitanei_ ) also enforced customs regulations -- the Romans did, for example, prevent the export of armor outside of the Empire -- and collected import duties from products being traded across the border.

The other big activity along the borders was diplomacy: the Romans always preferred to be surrounded by friendly client states. They would establish relations with neighboring groups whenever possible, by whatever combination of diplomacy, trade, bribery, and threat they could manage. They often intervened to support friendly rulers against rivals or to place a preferred candidate on a neighboring throne. They had a variety of agents --diplomats, military commanders, merchants and spies -- among the neighboring states watching for potential trouble and trying to influence local policy. 


The system wasn't perfect but it was a pretty efficient use of manpower and resources.
