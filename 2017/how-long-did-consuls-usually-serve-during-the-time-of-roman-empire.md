As the Consulate lost it’s practical importance with Caesar, it became more or less ceremonial — basically a public pat on the back to a friend or lackey of the emperor. Different emperors were more or less aggressive about the appointment of suffect consuls — you can see a lot of fluctuation in the number per year in [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_consuls#2nd_century); but in the second century three per year seems like a reasonable average. Among other ways you could use it for PR was to give somebody (say, the heir apparent) a whole year to himself or (even better) a whole year with the emperor as colleague; or, being suffect for the emperor rather than “the other guy” — there were lots of details in the status games being played and it’s not clear they were constant over time.

The practice tailed off during the 3rd century, when things were generally so bad that this kind of pantomime wasn’t worth the effort. After that the _Augusti_  tended to dominate the list either without colleagues or with each other.
