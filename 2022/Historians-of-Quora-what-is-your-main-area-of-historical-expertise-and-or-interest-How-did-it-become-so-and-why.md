I’ve always had a thing for tomes, the mustier and dustier the better.

I think I owe this all to my mother, who was amazingly self-educated. As a kid I used to curl up with her impressive hardbound collection of [Horizon Magazine](http://www.horizonmagazine.org/home.html), a very worthy upper-middlebrow mix of art and art history which completely blew my mind. To this day perhaps my most prized single book is a battered, threadbare copy of the [The Horizon Book of Lost Worlds,](https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Book-Lost-Worlds/dp/B00005W2R8) the book where I first met the Sumerians, the Hittites, and the Etruscans.

Between my mom, Horizon, and _[From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/from-the-mixed-up-files-of-mrs-basil-e-frankweiler-fifty-years-later)_ , I ended up weirdly obsessed with erudition. I wanted to be able to name-drop and to [skate effortlessly between Latin, Greek, and polysyllabic English like Sam Johnson](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-tips-to-write-like-Samuel-Johnson-the-Dr-Johnson-of-the-18th-century/answer/Steve-Theodore). In my 20’s I owned — unironically — a tweed jacket with leather elbow patches.

It was a bad life choice at a time when mentioning “Plato” in New York meant[ Plato's Retreat](https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/documentary-revisits-manhattan-sex-club-plato-s-retreat-1.1216791). It’s amazing I survived to adulthood, pompous twit that I was.

Why ancient history? Honestly, it was the physicality more than the subject — the hefty leather-bound books with fading gold-leaf titles; the stuffy New England reading rooms with marble busts; the cathedral hush of [the Cloisters](https://www.metmuseum.org/visit/met-cloisters) on a fall day. The happiest day of my then-professional life was taking a book out of the Harvard library that had last been checked out in 1749*. My favorite grad school course was paleography: poring over some facsimile manuscript with an actual magnifying glass. So Ancient history it had to be — “ancient” for the hoary obscurity, and “history” because I’m a terrible linguist, incapable of doing a good job in Classics.

I had just finished my exams and was just getting ready to start on my thesis when my mom passed away. I took some time off to take care of my dad.

During the year that followed, I realized a two important things: First, graduate school had really sapped my enthusiasm for the subject — what had begun as a passion was feeling like a chore. Second, the job market for ancient historians was in the same state as the job market for Roman centurions — that is to say, pretty damn dead. One of the kickers was coming in to the department office to pick up my mail and finding two colleagues eagerly poring over the obituaries in a trade mag, looking for job openings.**

While still in school I’d been supplementing my meager grad student income by doing computer training, and I’d had to teach myself a bunch of graphics software in order to teach it to others. I quickly discovered that running an SGI workstation was a lot more lucrative than correctly parsing a tricky passage in Isidore of Seville, which led by a couple of twists and turns to my current career in video games.

For the past 30 years or so I’ve just been a hobbyist. I am routinely mocked in my professional life for having something like [History Begins at Sumer](https://www.amazon.com/History-Begins-Sumer-Thirty-Nine-Recorded/dp/0812212762) on the same shelf as [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Computer-Graphics-Peter-Shirley/dp/1568814690), or for trying to weasel some kind of joke about the Numidians into my [zombie game](https://www.stateofdecay.com/). I get far too grumpy when people [can’t be bothered to get their armor designs right](http://www.crytek.com/games/ryse/overview).

Quora has really been a godsend for me, since it gives me a rewarding way to revisit a lot of the knowledge I acquired at such cost and then never got to use. It’s also a great way to fill in the absolutely infuriating little gaps in time which are everywhere in games. Re-compiling the Unreal Engine? Time to hunt down that line in Aristophanes about sausage-sellers. Waiting while I push 50 gigs of content to the Xbox? Hey, somebody wants to know about Roman tax law!

Quora is also a chance to have fun with the subject matter without the besetting sins of academia — the careerism, the jargon, the pomposity and the navel-gazing. I’m far happier and more engaged with history as a self-appointed amateur than I ever would have been had I somehow managed to beat the odds and get tenure.



_* The_ _[Vita Anskarii auctore Rimberto](https://archive.org/details/vitaanskariiauc00waitgoog)_ _. This Johnnie-come-lately edition dates from 1884. As far as I could find out the one in the Widener was, back in the day, the only physical copy in the eastern US._
