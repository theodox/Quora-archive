Manuscripts - that is to say, things written with a pen on something like paper - come pretty late. The oldest piece of writing on paper is [a spreadsheet](https://theodox.quora.com/The-worlds-oldest-spreadsheet), as [Tim Oneill](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-Oneill-16) points out, from around 4600 years ago. We don't know how long manuscript writing had been going on at that point, though it's safe to say (given the obvious sophistication of the that example) that it was already well established.

Writing on more durable substances survives longer. For systematic pictographs -- used as part of what looks like a routine recording rather than a personal artistic project -- the oldest contender is probably the [Dispilio Tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispilio_Tablet), a wooden tablet carved with a set of glyphs that was preserved in lake mud for more than 7,000 years:

This hasn't been deciphered, however, and without more context its not provable whether this is true writing (unlikely), symbolic record-keeping (more likely) or just a decorative motif. There are other records in this category, though not as old: the [Vinƒça symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_symbols) and the [Jiahu symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiahu_symbols) are also very graphic but pre-literate.

By the end of the 4th millenniun BC you can find good examples of how pictorial record keeping transformed into real writing in both Egypt and Mesopotamia. Most of this is basically accounting data -- "5 jars of oil owed to X" and so on --and becomes common after about 5500 years ago. By around 5000 years ago this rudimentary recording system was flexible and complex enough to record full sentences: everything from poetry to literature to laws and proclamations began to be recorded on clay. There are debates about the priority of different finds but the oldest continuous literary expression -- an actual text rather than an inscription or a label -- is probably the [The Kesh temple hymn](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section4/tr4802.htm) from about 2600 BC:

Interestingly it was first found in a carefully reconstructed text may by Babylonian scribes more than 800 years later, which [faithfully preserved a much older Sumerian text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesh_temple_hymn); even in 1800 BC they were interested in the history of writing.
