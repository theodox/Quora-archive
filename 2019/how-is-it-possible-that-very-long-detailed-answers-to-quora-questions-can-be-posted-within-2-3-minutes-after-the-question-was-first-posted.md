Folks with, erm, _a bit too much time on their hands_  frequently run into very slight variations on the same question. When the questions are _exactly_  the same you have the option to merge them — but often they do contain a different emphasis or twist that makes merging them nonsensical or a non-answer.

So, if you’re in the mood you bang out a new response that seems to be impressive for an off-the-cuff answer. However it’s only quick because you already did the homework — frequently you will recycle the same basic points , links or references.

It’s really not that hard to re-write an a variant of answer you’ve already done. Some questions are such perennials that you may have seen then a half-dozen times or more.
