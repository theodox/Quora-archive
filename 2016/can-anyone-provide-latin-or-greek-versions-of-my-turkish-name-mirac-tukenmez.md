Borrowing [Nick Nicholas](https://www.quora.com/profile/Nick-Nicholas-5)’s translation of the meaning of the names, “uptaking” would by _Assumptio._ If you’re enough of an English speaker to want to avoid having “ass” as your abbreviation, you could use the variant spelling Adsumptio. “inexhaustible” would be _Infinitus._ 

So: Adsumptio Infinitus. It’s a pretty cool name!
