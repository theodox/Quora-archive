Italians? It’s reported in Herodotus, a Greek writer. If the story is bogus it’s almost certainly reflecting the prejudiced of the Herodotus’s Egyptian informants, who present a pretty uniformly negative view of the Persian occupation.

It’s a story that has never been completely confirmed by archaeology, to be sure: there have been finds which might offer confirmation, but they’re subject to various interpretations.

However, there’s no question that the Persians conquered Egypt (in 525) and ruled if for most of the next 200 years. They fought against the kingdom of Kush to the south and against the Greek colonies in Cyrenaica to the west of Egypt.

The Persians generally didn’t “colonize” anywhere in the sense of sending settlers out to occupy land and build Persian communities. Essentially, the Persian empire was a giant protection racket: they show up, you agree to pay some tribute and you’re more or less left alone. If you resist, they’ll knock of the local leadership that doesn’t want to cooperate and replace it with local leadership that’s willing to play ball. A Persian governor and a garrison makes sure nobody gets any fresh ideas, and thing settle into the basic pattern: you send your annual tribute to Perseoplis, the Persians collect a skim on your import and export trade, and life goes on mostly as before: if you’re not part of the local political elite you’ll hardly notice a change.

_This is a statue of_ _[Wedjahor-Resne,](https://www.livius.org/articles/person/wedjahor-resne/)_ _an Egyptian priest who collaborated with the Persians (under Cambyses and Darius) and helped them to clothe their rule in Egyptian trappings. Part of the inscription reads_ 

_'The great king of all foreign countries Cambyses came to Egypt, taking the foreigners of every foreign country with him. When he had taken possession of the entire country, they settled themselves down therein, and he was made great sovereign of Egypt and great king of all foreign countries. His Majesty appointed me his chief physician and caused me to stay with him in my quality of companion and director of the palace, and ordered me to compose his titulary, his name as king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Mesuti-Ra [born of Ra]. And I made sure that His Majesty knew of the greatness of Sais, which is the seat of the great Neit, the mother who brought forth Re, and who unveiled birth when birth did not exist. [And I made sure that His Majesty knew] the significance of the temple of Neit, which is the sky in all its dispositions, and knew the greatness of the castles of the Red Crown_ 

_It’s likely that the head was removed by Egyptians who didn’t approve of Wedjahor-Resne’s willingness to work with the Persians. Similar sentiments are very visible in many stories Herodotus picked up in Egypt._

To make this work, though, there were Persian soldiers and officials stationed in in Egypt. We have almost no written sources about the day-to-day life of the Persian empire — but the best collection are a [series of letters written by the Persian governor of Egypt, Arsama](https://wayback.archive-it.org/org-467/20190828083642/http:/arshama.bodleian.ox.ac.uk) which give us a rare, precious glimpse of a Persian official administering Egypt — sometimes in a manner reminiscent of a 19th century British official in India. And — in another parallel to British India — the Persians used non-Persians to do the day-to-day work. For example the [Elephantine papyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantine_papyri) are a collection of private letters and documents from Egypt’s southern border. They concern the private affairs of a few Persian soldiers, but also of a sizable community of Jews: evidently, a mercenary garrison used to secure the strategic southern frontier. Like many empires, the Persians found that displaced minorities were a strategic asset: being isolated, they would not have political ambitions and, as outsiders, they’d be unlikely to make common cause with their Egyptian neighbors.
