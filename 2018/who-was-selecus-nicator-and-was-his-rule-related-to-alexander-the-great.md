Seleucus was one of Alexander’s generals.

After Alexander’s death, when the empire fell apart into warring factions, Seleucus ended up in control of the eastern portion: Mesopotamia, Persia, and Bactria. His territory ended up becoming the core of the [Seleucid Empire](https://www.ancient.eu/Seleucid_Empire/).
