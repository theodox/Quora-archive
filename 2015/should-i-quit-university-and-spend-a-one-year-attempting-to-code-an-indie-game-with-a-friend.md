Cool ideas, unfortunately, are much more common than successful games which provide a living for their developers. Besides a cool idea you need reliable tech, attractive art, a cost-effective way to make the game content, good quality control, and a way to get your game into the hands of the public in a form that pays your bills.

As a thought experiment, let's say you have a 50% chance of doing well at each of those critical tasks. (50% may be pretty generous, by the way!) Your chance of getting all the way from the concept stage to a finished commercialized product is something like .5 * .5 *.5 * .5 * .5 * .5 or .015 -- a bit better than 1.5 %. If we assume that your idea is great, you've doubled (!) your chances to a bit over 3%.

Scary?

The point is not to discourage you. These numbers are, don't forget, ones that I __just made up__ . I just mean to illustrate some of the unglamorous aspects that indie devs often don't think about when they're in a creative mood. _Do you have a marketing plan? Have a way to pay for contract artists? What about localization? How about regulatory compliance? etc, etc._  Making a cool game is hard by itself; making one that actually pays the bills and leaves room to make another is much, much harder -- the world is full of fun games that didn't pay back their creators. __Be sure to read Dan Cook's post about__ __[minimum sustainable success](http://www.lostgarden.com/)__ __before making any big plans.__ 

Making games increasingly approximates making music or being a pro athlete: it's fun, emotionally rewarding, and for a tiny subset of people it's a great way to make a living. For a lot of others it's an economic dead end even when it's an artistic success. Approach yourself dropping out to make games they way you'd approach a friend who told you they were dropping out to make music or play professional rugby and you'll be in the right frame of mind to make the decision.

It's also a great idea to see what the life of a working dev is like. A summer job as a QA tester will bore you to tears much of the time but will give you a far better idea of what to look forward too -- for good and for ill.
