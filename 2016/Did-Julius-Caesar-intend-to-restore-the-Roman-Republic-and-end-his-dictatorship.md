We don’t know for sure, of course, but it’s not likely.

The closest analogy (one Caesar would have been quite familiar with) is the career of [Sulla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla), who assumed the first dictatorship in Roman history without the customary annual time limit in 82 BC. However he took the title dictator _legibus faciendis et reipublicae constituendae causa_ , “dictator for the purpose of making laws and a constitution for the republic” — which at least suggested, correctly, that he saw his task as a situational one rather than a permanent position. True to his word in that aspect, at least, Sulla did retire to private life in 81; although his election to consul in 80 was hardly ‘free and fair’ it was at least an election and after that he stepped back from politics.

[Suetonius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/suetonius/12caesars/julius*.html) quotes Caesar as saying “Sulla did not know his ABC’s when he laid down his dictatorship” and that “ men ought now to be more circumspect in addressing him, and to regard his word as law. “

On this simplest level, Caesar could have signaled his intentions by engineering a version of the kind of supreme military command that he had helped to engineer for Pompey’s war against the pirates. Or a dictatorship-for-cause like Sulla’s. Instead he gave himself the title of _[dictator perpetuo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator_perpetuo)_ _,_ and the “perpetuo” (which means what it sounds like in English) is a pretty strong indication that he had no retirement plans. He also joked that Brutus (whom he was considering as a possible heir) didn’t need to assassinate him, he merely needed to “wait out this old body.” — which suggests pretty strongly he expected to die as a public, not a private man.
