Even in Roman times Ireland was pretty far off the beaten track. The tradition of Greek language learning in Ireland comes via the monasteries of the 6th-10th centuries. Since Ireland never had a Latin-speaking population, Irish scholars had to learn Latin “the hard way” — and, since they were all monks, they also tackled all of the biblical languages: Greek, Hebrew and Syriac as well as Latin.

The Greeks knew _vaguely_  of Ireland's existence early on — it's mentioned in Aristotle in an “far end of the world” context. The explorer [Pytheas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pytheas) sailed the Irish Sea in the 4th century BC, although it's not clear from the few citations if he actually visited Ireland. Even 500 years later in the Roman period the information is very sketchy so it's clear that the contacts were fairly minimal.

Most of Greek information regarding Ireland is probably second hand, via the Carthaginians. Carthaginian traders were active in the British isles fairly early (and until the destruction of Carthage they discouraged other nations from sailing out into the Atlantic on a regular basis). According to [Avienus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avienus), a later Roman author:

> From here [Brittany] it is a two day voyage to the sacred isle [= Ireland, which sounds like _hieros, ‘sacred’_ in Greek] (for by this name the ancients called the isle) it lies, rich in grass, among the waves; thickly populated by the _Hierni_ [Hibernians]. Nearby lies the island of the _Albiones_ [ie, Britain]. The Tartessians were accustomed to trade even to the edge of the Oestrymnides. The Carthaginian colonists and people around the Pillars of Hercules frequented these waters. Four months is scarcely enough for the voyage, as Himilco the Carthaginian proved by sailing there and back himself.
