Originally, the Romans were from Italy; the name come from the city of Rome.

Romania got its name from the fact the southern and western portions of the country formed the core of the Roman military frontier in the Balkans for several hundred years, with a large Roman army presence that brought with it a huge influx of Latin speakers. Many of these were not from Italyâ€” the empire was a big, complex, multicultural system and at least a quarter of the Roman troops in Romania were from elsewhere: from Gaul, from Greece, from the Middle East, and from elsewhere in the Balkans.

Soldiers frequently retired and settled near where they served, so the Latin-speaking communities that built up around the military camps had a big influence on modern Romanian.
