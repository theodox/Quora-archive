There was not a strong tradition on this subject. Most Greeks, following Herodotus, recognized the Phoenician origins of the Greek alphabet. Archaic Greek inscriptions — Herodotus claimed to have seen these at Delphi, for example — were “Cadmean letters,” since [Cadmus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmus)— the legendary founder of Thebes — was traditionally a Phoenician.

[Diodorus Siculus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1A*.html), who was interested in compiling a universal history including all the known cultures of his world, records the existence of conflicting opinions. He assigns the original invention of writing to the Egyptian god Thoth (1.16; he uses the Greek name Hermes, but he’s discussing Egyptian history). Later, though, jhe goes on to repeat the story of the Cadmean letters (3.67). However at 5.74 he says this:

> To the Muses, we are further told, it was given by their father Zeus to discover the letters and to combine words in the way which is designated poetry. And in reply to those who say that the Syrians are the discoverers of the letters, the Phoenicians having learned them from the Syrians and then passed them on to the Greeks, and that these Phoenicians are those who sailed to Europe together with Cadmus and this is the reason why the Greeks call the letters “Phoenician,” men tell us, on the other hand, that the Phoenicians were not the first to make this discovery, but that they did no more than to change the forms of the letters, whereupon the majority of mankind made use of the way of writing them as the Phoenicians devised it, and so the letters received the designation we have mentioned above.

So, presumably there were at least three versions floating around: one where the letters are a purely Phoenician invention, one where they are descended from Egypt, and the third where they come from Syria (which might possibly be a reference to [Ugarit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugarit), but probably means Assyria or Mesopotamia in general).

I don’t think its likely either the Egyptian or the Syrian origin stories reflect a strong tradition about the historical transmission of the characters. The Hellenistic world included a number of nationalist histories written in Greek by non-Greeks, presenting the traditional world view of different nationalities for a Greek audience. Examples would include [Berossus the Babylonian ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berossus)and [Manetho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho), both of whom presented traditional accounts of the origins of the arts and sciences according to their own traditions. I’d guess that the argument between the Syrian and Egyptian proponents ultimately reflected those kinds of sources rather than an actual record of the transmission of literacy.
