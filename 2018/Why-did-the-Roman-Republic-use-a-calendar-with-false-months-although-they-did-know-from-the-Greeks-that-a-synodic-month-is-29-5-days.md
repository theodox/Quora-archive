# Why did the Roman Republic use a calendar with false-months although they did know from the Greeks that a synodic month is 29.5 days?

Greek and Roman calendars were — until the reforms of Julius Caesar in the 1st century BC — generally pretty messy. A Roman observer would not necessarily have regarded them as radically superior to Rome’s own (equally confusing) traditional calendar.

It’s definitely true that _some_  Greeks had a pretty good mathematical grasp of the complex relationship between the lunar cycle and the solar year. That knowledge, though, was not evenly distributed around the Greek world. In this regard the Romans weren’t any different than the average Greeks.

A mathematician like [Eratosthenes ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes)would know that the solar year was 365 days (with an extra day in leap years) and most astronomers were aware of the 19-year [Metonic cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle) which tracked the alignment of the solar year and the phases of the moon and which was known as early as the 5th century BC.

Greek city calendars, though, generally did not reflect this theoretical knowledge. Even though the Meton who gave his name to the Metonic cycle, was an Athenian, the [Athenian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_calendar#Lunisolar_calendar) remained a rule-of-thumb hodgepodge all the way down to the Roman period. The Athenians for example used intercalary months for their “leap years” leading to a 384-day year every four years; this was intended to get the months to line up with the summer solstice, but it was not a very accurate adjustment. The comedian Aristophanes, writing in the 420’s BC, complained about the inaccuracy of the Athenian calendar — and more than 2 centuries later the system was still so unwieldy that the civil and traditional religious calendars had to run separately.

Every city-state maintained its own calendar, driven by local custom and tradition; these rarely lined up in any predictable way and were generally managed by politicians rather than astronomers. The few people who tried to work out precise calibrations between different Greek calendars usually relied on proxies. The historian Thucydides, for example, preferred to date events relative to a handful of astronomical landmarks rather than the civil calendars since he was covering events all over the Greek world. The [Olympiad system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad) likewise used the 4-year cycle of the Olympic games to provide a reference point that was common across the many conflicting local calendars.

All of which is a long winded way of saying that a Roman, observing Greek calendars, would not immediately say “that’s so much superior to our system.”

The months in the pre-Julian Roman lunar calendar were actually not that far off the 29.5 day figure— they averaged 29.583 (29 and 7/12th) days with a mix of 29 and 31 day months (except for February, which seems always to have had 28). The Roman lunar year however only totaled 355 days, and required the introduction of an intercalary month of 27 or 28 days to keep it roughly in sync with the sun. Some Greek writers credit the Romans with a variant of the Metonic cycle system but there’s no actual evidence in Roman sources.

Because the Roman system was administered — not very professionally — by politicians, it was subject to frequent breakdowns. The actual connection with the phases of the moon was almost purely notional as early as the 3rd century BC. This was periodically fixed by political decrees but the system itself was too cumbersome.

When Julius Caesar finally decided to rationalize the Roman year, he started by breaking the pretense of dependence on the moon altogether. His system system did a pretty good job of locking the calendar to the solar year — it was a 365.25 day solar cycle while the modern Gregorian calendar is 365.2425 days. However Caesar didn’t reform the months; he kept their pre-existing, irregular traditional month lengths with a little padding to get the year to its current 365 day form. February retained it’s traditional role as the place where the extra fixups were added, but they now consisted of a single day every four years instead of a month every two.
