I had to look this one up, but I was quite surprised to find that the walls of Babylon were intact to the height of 12 meters or so

The walls were not exposed until the digs, which started in 1899; these pictures are from 1914 or thereabouts.

He deserves a lot of credit for taking a gentler and more sustainable approach to the material than, say [Heinrich Schliemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Schliemann) did in Troy.

Despite this, reassembling the brick murals was a daunting and painstaking task:
