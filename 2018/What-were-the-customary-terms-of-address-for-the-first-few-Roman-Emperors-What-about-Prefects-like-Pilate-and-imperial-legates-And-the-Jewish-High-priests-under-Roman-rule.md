There was not a single formal style for emperors in the early imperial period — though it’s a good bet that the forms acceptable from a wealthy Roman and those acceptable from a provincial would be rather different.

I’ve covered it in more detail in [How would commoners address royalty in Ancient Rome?](https://www.quora.com/How-would-commoners-address-royalty-in-Ancient-Rome), but the TLDR is that during the first century or so of the empire a high status person could probably address the emperor by name, in a social setting; a soldier might use _imperator,_ which doubled as a military rank and an honorific; and an ordinary person would probably find some form of honorific, perhaps combined with a title of office: “most respected consul” or “pious sir”. “_Caesar_ ” was a kind of special case because it was conceptually just a name, though in practice it was a title of office — it filled the invaluable role of papering over the huge difference between an old-time Roman aristocrat who could be accosted by name — “Greetings, Gaius Valerius!” — and the sole ruler of the world.

In general flattering adjectives did for many ancient people what formalized titulature did in later European society: where a medieval person had a rote formula like “your Grace” to fall back on an imperial era Roman would improvise something like “clement Caesar.”

For lesser officials, the rules are a lower-key version of the same thing for emperors: names if you are of similar social rank, title if not, and some extra adjectives to show deference. Using a title implies social distance, either up or down — a general could address a centurion as “centurion” or by name, but a centurion would be more likely to use something like “commander” to the general unless they were old acquaintances.

As a generic address _Dominus,_ ”lord,” was in flux during this period — in the early days it smacked of servitude, so a free-born citizen would be reluctant to use it, even to an emperor. By the end of the first century it was used openly as an imperial title, and had lost a lot of its original meaning, approximating “sir” or “mister.” The same exact metamorphosis had happened to the Greek word _kyrios_  a couple of centuries before; in the Greek east _kyrios_ would be an uncontroversial _sir_  in ordinary use, though — like “sir” with emphasis it was a title of respect.

_Patronus,_ “patron” was also a suitable generic term of respect for a civilian superior — particular one with whom you were trying to curry favor. It would not be used between equals, however.



As for Jewish high priests, there might be something more elaborate in the Talmud. In Hebrew it’s _kohen gadol,_ “great priest” or _kohen harosh,_ “chief priest”.__ In Greek they seem to have been address by title as _archiereus,_  which is literally “priest-in-charge,” a title that would be common in any Greek city. That’s how, for example, Josephus represents king Ptolemy of Egypt addressing High Priest [Eleazar.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazar_(High_Priest))

In the first century of the Roman empire there was tension between the priestly elite and what would eventually become the “rabbinate” — the community of scholars and interpreters who were busy creating what would become diaspora Judaism. It didn’t help that several high priests in the Hellenistic and Roman era had been enthusiastic Hellenizers. So, we don’t have a ton of positive portrayals of the high priest from the period in question. However the level of formal ritual restriction on a high priest was pretty high: [Sanhedrin 18](http://www.come-and-hear.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_18.html) and [19](http://www.come-and-hear.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_19.html) give a good idea of the level of formality with which a high priest had to behave in public himself. There’s a good round up of related material here: [HIGH PRIEST - JewishEncyclopedia.com](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7689-high-priest)
