Forum isn't a bad choice; one of the meanings of _forum_  is basically 'commercial space,' much like the Greek _agora._ However Roman forums were also important public spaces for politics and the law; in any large city you wouldn't say _the_ forum, you'd specify which one. 

In big cities most areas were what we'd call 'mixed use' -- the common Roman [Insula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_(building))[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_(building))were multi-story structures with shops and eateries on the first floor and apartments above. So for common necessities the shopping would probably be done at the equivalent of a corner store instead a dedicated commercial district. Roman cities had a lot of eateries, taverns and wine-shops: most Roman apartments didn't have ovens and many did not have running water, so Romans tended to eat out a lot.

If you're thinking of Sardis in particular, this won't help with the terminology but you may find it useful:
