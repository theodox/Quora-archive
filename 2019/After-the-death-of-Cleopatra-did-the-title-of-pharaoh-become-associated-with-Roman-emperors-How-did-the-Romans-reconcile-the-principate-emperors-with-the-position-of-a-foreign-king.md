Essentially, the Egyptians needed a Pharaoh more than the emperors needed to _be_  pharaohs. Both sides found a way to make the relationship work, but it was… complicated.

Octavian (not yet Augustus) made a point of not taking a crown when he conquered Egypt — he went into the war with Antony and Cleopatra [amid a raft of propaganda contrasting his old-fashioned Roman virtues with the raffish and exotic behavior of his enemies](https://brewminate.com/augustus-the-use-of-propaganda-to-establish-and-maintain-legitimacy-and-power/). The last thing he wanted was for his Roman supporters to think he was “going native.”

However not taking the crown didn’t mean Egypt didn’t matter to him. Egypt was the richest part of the Mediterranean world, and fantastically fertile (though it was not yet the primary source of Rome’s grain supplies). Octavian was well aware of Egypt’s value: it had, after all, bankrolled Antony’s armies. So he made sure not to let the reins of Egypt out of his own hands: it was essentially treated as a personal possession rather than a more conventional part of the Roman Empire. No Senators — who might have political ambitions — were ever allowed to govern Egypt; the emperor hand-picked governors for the province from outside the political class and administered the province without the say of the Senate.

[The Ptolemies had already treated Egypt almost like a plantation-state](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Africa/Egypt/_Texts/BEVHOP/5C*.html), so there was already a well-developed bureaucracy and a very intrusive system of taxation tailor made for the new rulers. The Caesars simply replaced the king or queen in Alexandria with a Roman viceroy whose job was to keep things quiet, keep the money flowing, and make sure that no Roman politicians or generals who threaten the emperor got anywhere near the place. Roman Egypt was a business arrangement, first and foremost — a valuable estate to exploit, not a kingdom to rule with paternal care.

__Egyptian Religion__ 

The Egyptian view, however, was different. The upper classes of Egypt wanted a pharaoh for reasons of their own.

The native temples were a crucial part of the system the Romans inherited from the Ptolemies. They functioned as a kind of parallel social system, outside the Greekified culture of Alexandria and the larger cities — the priesthoods were the most powerful and prestigious positions open to native Egyptians, who were otherwise kept away from the higher ranks of the bureaucracy. In return for royal patronage the temples provided a degree of social harmony in the irreplaceable province. The temples had generally enjoyed a positive relationship with the Ptolemies and they wanted a similarly good deal under the Caesars.

They also had an important theological problem. For historical reasons the temples were deeply committed to the idea that the Pharaoh was a divine intercessor between humanity and the gods. Centuries of tradition dictated that it was the pharaoh who mediated the order of the cosmos on behalf of Egypt. Creating a version of traditional Egyptian belief that didn’t have a pharaoh at its center would have been a complex theological challenge, especially given the intense conservatism that characterized Egyptian society.

If the Roman emperors were willing to keep paying the bills — perhaps not on the same lavish scale as the Ptolemies but enough to keep the Nile in its bed — the temples found it easier (and, let’s not forget, _safer_ ) to simply insert the new rulers into the existing pharaonic framework, regardless of practical politics or the actual behavior of the rulers. Egypt had done this before, for the Ptolemies, the Persians, the Kushites and the Libyans and the Hyksos and all the other foreigners who had ruled the land. So, from an Egyptian perspective the substitution of a Roman Augustus for a Greek Cleopatra was not a huge jump or a terrible break with a tradition that was pragmatic as well as ancient.

Whatever Octavian’s personal feelings about Egypt were, he clearly saw that it made eminent sense to extend the existing Ptolemaic-Egyptian synthesis and become the Pharaoh that the Egyptians wanted, even if only for Egyptian consumption. It didn’t take long to figure out, either: one of the very first Roman-era inscriptions in Egypt is a trilingual stele put up by [Cornelius Gallus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Gallus) in 29 BC, only a year after the death of Cleopatra, the Egyptian version of the text is [clearly using traditional Egyptian titles for Octavian even though the Latin and Greek texts don’t use royal titles](https://rogueclassicism.com/2010/04/10/stele-names-roman-emperor-octavian-augustus-as-egyptian-pharaoh-news-archaeology-the-independent/).

Quite quickly you begin to see imagery like this (ca. 10 BC) , which shows emperor Octavian, now Augustus, (at right) wearing the traditional crown of the Two Lands and offering a traditional sacrifice to Thoth and Hethor;

Thus, as far as Egypt was concerned (official, temple-building Egypt anyway) the emperor was the new Pharaoh. The names of Augustus and his successors, down to [Maximinus Daia](https://www.quora.com/Why-were-there-no-more-pharaohs-after-Cleopatra) (311–313) were always written in the traditional royal cartouches:

_Kaisaros: “Caesar”_ 

and in classically long-winded royal titles:

_The sturdy-armed one with great strength, the youth sweet of love, ruler of rulers, chosen of Ptah and Nun, the father of the gods … that is, Gaius Julius Caesar, pater patriae (both images c/o_ _[Pharaoh.se](https://pharaoh.se/roman-emperor/Augustus)_ _)_ 

The fact that this had nothing to do with “kingship” in the ordinary sense — with administration and law, which were handled by the Roman governor and the Greek bureaucracy — actually rendered this a very useful compromise. Egyptian priests could demonstrate their loyalty to native tradition and to foreign ruler at the same time in a way that did not necessarily involve them in the high-stakes game of imperial politics. We do see cases where formerly pharaonic emperors were erased (Caracalla, for example, is frequently chiselled off of Egyptian temples) but on the whole the very abstract nature of being a Roman-era pharaoh kept the native elites out of trouble.

__Roman Politics__ 

How was the fact that the heir of Caesar was also the Son of Horus reconciled at home?

Mostly, it was ignored.

The emperors certainly did not indulge in their role as Egyptian god-Kings back home in Italy — it would have been particularly hard for Augustus, who had bankrolled a lot of anti-Cleopatra propaganda during his wars with Antony and would have had to do a huge public about face with his Roman supporters (this may explain why Augustus never actually publicly assumed a crown, and seems not to have personally presided over any Egyptian rites). In Latin and Greek sources the emperor retained his ordinary titles, _imperator_  in Latin and _autokrator_  in Greek. His role as Horus, son of Isis, beloved of the gods, Re-Harakte, beloved of Ptah, &c &c was a matter for domestic Egyptian consumption only. But, since the imagery and language were basically incomprehensible to ordinary Romans it hardly mattered in domestic politics.

In any case, whatever unease accompanied the immediate aftermath of the Roman conquest mattered less as time went on. The veneer of republican propriety wore off pretty fast outside of Italy, even during Augustus’ lifetime. Roman traditionalists liked to pretend that the _princeps_  was just a particularly honored Senator but for the rest of the empire — much of which had its own native traditions of king-worship — the line between offering sacrifices “on behalf of the emperor’s wellbeing” and actually worshipping him as a god was fuzzy at best. The coy facade of the principate didn’t last very long, in any case: Caligula was regarded as a megalomaniac for demanding (and — importantly — _receiving)_ worship as a living god; but Domitian wore the title proudly and matter of factly.

On the Egyptian side, however the whole role of ‘pharaoh’ was also gradually hollowing out. However alien, the Ptolemies were physically present — they provided a living, visible focus for the traditional view of divine kingship. Distant Romans, who might visit Egypt once in a generation, were not very satisfying objects of reverence. Egyptian tradition viewed Egypt as the center of the human world — to be relegated to the periphery of the Roman world was in many ways the kiss of death for the pharaonic world view. It’s probably not a coincidence that Egypt was one of the first provinces to embrace Christianity — the ruler cult needed more than passive encouragement from far-off emperors to remain relevant.
