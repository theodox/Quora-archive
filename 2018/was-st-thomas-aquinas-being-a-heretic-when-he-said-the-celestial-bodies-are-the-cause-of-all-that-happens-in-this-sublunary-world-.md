Not for a 13th century Catholic, anyway. The pull quote is

> It must be observed, however, that indirectly and accidentally, the impressions of heavenly bodies can reach the intellect and will, forasmuch, namely, as both intellect and will receive something from the inferior powers which are affixed to corporeal organs. But in this the intellect and will are differently situated. For the intellect, of necessity, receives from the inferior apprehensive powers: wherefore if the imaginative, cogitative, or memorative powers be disturbed, the action of the intellect is, of necessity, disturbed also. The will, on the contrary, does not, of necessity, follow the inclination of the inferior appetite; for although the passions in the irascible and concupiscible have a certain force in inclining the will; nevertheless the will retains the power of following the passions or repressing them. Therefore the impressions of the heavenly bodies, by virtue of which the inferior powers can be changed, have less influence on the will, which is the proximate cause of human actions, than on the intellect.

> To maintain therefore that heavenly bodies are the cause of human actions is proper to those who hold that intellect does not differ from sense. Wherefore some of these said that "such is the will of men, as is the day which the father of men and of gods brings on" (Odyssey xviii 135). Since, therefore, it is manifest that intellect and will are not acts of corporeal organs, __it is impossible that heavenly bodies be the cause of human actions__ .

In other words “the stars affect physical bodies, but not intellects.” You’ll note that he leaves room for the stars to affect the body — so astrological influence can make you prone to anger or hunger — but it does not remove your free will.

The “influence of heavenly bodies” was just plain old secular science in the 13th century, his main interest in it is to avoid astrological determinism which was an old, well recognized heresy. Ironically St. Augustine — who was more friendly to the theological idea of predestination than Aquinas — was much more skeptical of astrology (noting, for example, that twins rarely share the same destiny). In Augustine’s day astrology was a much more powerful force, deeply baked into late-Roman tradition and popular culture, and therefore he saw it as almost a serious rival ideology. For Aquinas it’s just a corner of the general problem of the relationship between free will and necessity.
