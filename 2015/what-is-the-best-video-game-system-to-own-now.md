Honestly - as you can see from the other answers - in this generation the mainstream consoles are very close in technical capacity. There are not even a ton of killer exclusives to drive traffic to one side or the other. The most important reason to pick one over the other is, as the [Brian Greenhow](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brian-Greenhow) points out, is to go where your friends already are. 

If that is not a decider, you might find Xbox has an edge in the non-game content - apps, music and video shopping are somewhat easier to work with on the Xbox, and if you are a big TV watcher the integrated cable functions might be useful (I hardly watch TV so I'm not a good judge) The PS has a better selection of indie and art titles. although MS is trying to catch up. 

As for the PC -- well, a good gaming rig is absolutely a better experience, as long as you don't mind paying 2-3X the price :)

Last of all: if you have younger kids, the Wii-u has the best family titles. It's not competitive for AAA games, but it's worth if for _Mario Kart_  and _Super Smash Bros_  alone.
