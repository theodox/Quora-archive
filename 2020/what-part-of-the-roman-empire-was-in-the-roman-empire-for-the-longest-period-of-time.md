The trans-temporal heart of the Roman Empire is the province of [Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(Roman_province)), which was annexed in 146 BC and remained an imperial possession all the way down to 1453: just a hair short of 1600 years. The most traveled Roman road — though, alas, not the best preserved — is the Macedonian [Via Egnatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Egnatia) which served the empire for sixteen centuries.

By contrast _Rome itself_  was only part of the Roman empire from the founding of the Republic in 509 BC until the city lost the last figleaf of political connection to the surviving East Roman government in Constantinople in 752 - a total of 1268 years.

If you want to limit “Roman” to the western imperial succession, the answer would probably be [Fidenae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidenae), an Etruscan town on the Roman side of the Tiber. The young Republic defeated Fidenae and garrisoned it in 505 BC. The city was permanently settled by Romans in 435. Depending on how you count it Fidenae — a couple of hours walk from the forum — remained a Roman possession for 981 or 911 years.

> Note to sticklers; no effort made to calculate things like temporary changes of rulership or disputed successions — these are “best case” numbers.
