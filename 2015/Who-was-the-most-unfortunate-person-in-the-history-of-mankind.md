If you define unfortunate as the difference between the highs and lows in life, I'd nominate __[Croesus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croesus)__ , King of Lydia. 

Croesus was legendary for his wealth and power (Lydia was a major source of gold in the ancient world, and the original inventor of coinage : see [Did they have inflation in ancient Lydia and Phrygia?](https://www.quora.com/Did-they-have-inflation-in-ancient-Lydia-and-Phrygia)). He was widely known as the richest man in the world. The story goes that he was visited by Solon, the Athenian wise man, and tried to impress the stranger by displaying his riches:



> On this account, as well as to see the world, Solon set out upon his travels, in the course of which he went to Egypt to the court of Amasis, and also came on a visit to Croesus at Sardis. Croesus received him as his guest, and lodged him in the royal palace. On the third or fourth day after, he bade his servants conduct Solon. over his treasuries, and show him all their greatness and magnificence. When he had seen them all, and, so far as time allowed, inspected them, Croesus addressed this question to him. "Stranger of Athens, we have heard much of thy wisdom and of thy travels through many lands, from love of knowledge and a wish to see the world. I am curious therefore to inquire of thee, whom, of all the men that thou hast seen, thou deemest the most happy?" 


Solon, however, refused to go along: he cited a several other "happy" mortals, all of whom had lived lives of virtuous obscurity instead of fabulous luxury. In keeping with the rather pessimistic Greek view of life and fate, he told Croesus 



> He who unites the greatest number of advantages, and retaining them to the day of his death, then dies peaceably, that man alone, sire, is, in my judgment, entitled to bear the name of 'happy.' But in every matter it behooves us to mark well the end: for oftentimes God gives men a gleam of happiness, and then plunges them into ruin."


Croesus dismissed Solon with a sneer. Alas for Croesus, Solon had it right. 

His misfortunes began when he chose the unlucky [Adrastus ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrastus_%28son_of_Gordias%29)to accompany his son while hunting. Adrastus, a refugee, was a friend and dependent of the king -- but during the hunt he accidentally killed Croesus son and heir Atys. Although Croesus forgave the killing, Adrastus killed himself in remorse, adding the loss of a close friend to the loss of his child.

However Croesus' luck still had farther to run out. He got ambitious and contemplated a war against the Persians. He sent an inquiry to the Oracle of Delphi, who told him ""If Croesus goes to war he will destroy a great empire." 

 He neglected to ask _which_  empire, however.

Croesus was [defeated by the Persians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thymbra) and captured by his arch-enemy [Cyrus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great.html). He was forced to watch as his capital was sacked and then bound to the top of a giant pyre: Cyrus, having heard that Croesus was particularly pious, wanted to see if some god would intervene to save the fallen king. As the flames rose around him, he groaned the name of Solon who had warned him not to count his life blessed until it was over. 

In one version of the story, at least, Cyrus was intrigued by this inexplicable outcry and saved Croesus from the flames, keeping him as a cross between a POW, a court jester, and an advisor. 

In the other version he was burned alive.
