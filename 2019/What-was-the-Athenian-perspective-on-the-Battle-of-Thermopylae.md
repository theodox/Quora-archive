You can make a good case that Herodotus’ version provides decent approximation of the Athenian perspective on Thermopylae. It was written and publicly presented for the first time in Athens, and although Herodotus was not an Athenian by birth his viewpoint is markedly Athenophile in outlook. His overall attitude about the war is pretty well summed up in 7.139:

> It was the Athenians who held the balance; whichever side they joined was sure to prevail. choosing that Greece should preserve her freedom, the Athenians roused to battle the other Greek states which had not yet gone over to the Persians and, after the gods, were responsible for driving the king off

Herodotus’ personal opinion here and the average Athenian’s point of view were probably pretty close on this point.

Despite the Athenian conviction that the victory over Persia was essentially an Athenian victory, it is still Herodotus the Athenian admirer who gives us the heroic set-piece depiction of Thermopylae. When Herodotus wrote, the pull of traditional heroic ideals and the lingering glow of pan-Hellenic cooperation against the Persians were still stronger than the partisan rivalry between Athens and Sparta.

The bitter ideological strife which rendered that war so different from routine city-state squabbles took a long time to develop. The Peloponnesian war broke out late in Herodotus’ life, a couple of decades after he wrote his account of Thermopylae. In the five decades between Thermopylae and the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in 431, the conservative side of Athenian politics always respected Sparta’s traditional role as _beaux ideal_ of Greek warrior aristocracy — [Cimon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimon), the leader of the Athenian aristocratic party in the mid-400’s, even named his son “[Lacedaemonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacedaemonius)”. As the more radical democrats in Athens increasingly challenged the preeminence of their own aristocrats that stance would become increasingly controversial — but it remained a widespread attitude for many well into the war itself. Plato and Xenophon, two of the most famous Athenian admirers of Sparta, were born within a couple of years of the outbreak of the war.

So it’s not too much of a surprise that Herodotus — and by extension, a large swathe of his Athenian audience, was willing to offer honor to the heroes of Thermopylae. Outright hostility to Sparta would not become a dominant note in Athenian politics until well into the generation-long Peloponnesian War.

More importantly, though, the story (at least, the story as Herodotus tells it) was the kind of thing no Greek could resist.

Herodotus has a lot of Homer in his bones; he respects a grand heroic gesture with a fine even-handedness independent of historical consequence or partisan alliance. In his own introduction he says that he writes

> so that things done by man not be forgotten in time, and that great and marvelous deeds, some __displayed by the Hellenes, some by the barbarians__ , not lose their glory,

Where Homer is as happy to praise Hector as Achilles, Herodotus the Athenophile is still moved by the sacrifice of Leonidas and his companions. The story he tells fits beautifully into the Greek heroic tradition of disdain for death and personal honor: a view of the battle which would tug the heartstrings of any Greek who knew his _Iliad._ Even the unsentimental Thucydides could not help but be moved. He described the Athenian victory at [Sphacteria ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sphacteria)in 425, where a small Spartan force was surrounded by a larger Athenian army like this:

> The Lacedaemonians thus placed between two fires — in the same dilemma (to compare small things with great) as at Thermopylae, where the defenders were cut off through the Persians getting round by the path — were now attacked in front and behind, began to give way, and overcome by the odds against them and exhausted from want of food, retreated.

[4.12](http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.4.fourth.html) (punctuation changed a bit for emphasis)

Against that background, it’s a good guess that the average Athenian — even during the dark days of the Peloponnesian War — regarded the story of Thermopylae as a stirring part of the Greek national epic, a living example of the kind of virtues that Homer had praised and which remained central to the Greek self-image long after the political impact of the battle was relevant. A large minority of Athenians dreamed of a pan-Hellenic union in which Athens and Sparta were the co-equal leaders of a united Greek front against Persia; for them the cleverness of Themistocles and the stoic self-sacrifice of Leonidas were complementary faces of an ennobling Greek ideal — as well as symbols that transcended the endless petty rivalries which marked the reality of city-state politics. Leonidas, Spartan or not, was a Greek hero that Athenians could admire despite the vicissitudes of politics.



__Afterword__ 

There’s one ancient writer who does think that Herodotus (and, by implication, the Athenians) stinted the glory due to Leonidas and the 300.

Plutarch objected to several aspects of Herodotus’ histories but in particular to Herodotus’ portrayal of the Boeotians, who are depicted as eager collaborators with the Persians. In his _[On The Malice Of Herodotus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0352%3Asection%3D32)_ __ Plutarch claims that Herodotus deliberately downplayed the glory due to Leonidas by omitting many of the noble sayings attributed to the Spartan king on his last stand.

This, Plutarch says, shows Herodotus’ anti-Spartan bias since the same author who retailed stories about the farts of pharaoh Amasis (2.162) neglected several noble sentiments of Leonidas — sayings Plutarch himself collected in his [Sayings of Spartans](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Sayings_of_Spartans*/main.html). It’s far from clear, however, that those sayings are really authentic — there are quite a lot of them for a battle whose hallmark was leaving no survivors. They seem quite likely to be later inventions, along the lines of what you get when googling Einstein quotes today.
