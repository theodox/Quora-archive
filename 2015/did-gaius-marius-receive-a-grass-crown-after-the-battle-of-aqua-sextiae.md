Traditionally a grass crown was awarded "by acclamation of the whole army", so if the account is correct and the award was made by the officers, it was something else. Laurel wreaths are a fairly generic symbol of "victory" where the grass crown has a very specific meaning -- only a handful were awarded in all of Roman history.
