Nowadays [Coptic ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language)— the modern descendant of the speech of the Pharoahs — exists only as the liturgical language of the Coptic church. Like Latin in Europe, it’s still available for study but it’s [not an everyday language](https://dailynewsegypt.com/2005/12/10/coptic-languages-last-survivors/), even for Coptic Christians (who make something over 10% of Egypt’s population).

Coptic was still a fairly common spoken language as recently as the 1500’s, but Arabic — the language of the Islamic conquest — was the language of government and also of international trade . Given the prevalence of[ harassment and attacks on the Coptic minority in Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Copts) its unlikely that the Egyptian state will adopt Coptic even as a second language any time soon.
