The classical-era “Corinthian” helmet is a full-face helmet without a movable visor. So there’s no way to depict someone wearing it and show their face. You see the same cocked helmet in, for example, the famous bust of Pericles:

Or in coins depicting male warriors:

After Alexander the Great’s era, open-face helmets of various kinds replaced the Corinthian style, so later Greek art tends to show open-face helmets. The old-fashioned cocked-helmet pose hung on as a tradition in depictions of the gods, though even there later depictions frequently followed the change in military fashion:
