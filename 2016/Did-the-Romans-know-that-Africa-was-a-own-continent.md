They borrowed from Greek geography, so yes: the 3-fold division of the then-known world into Asia, Europe, and what the Greeks called “Libya” goes back all the way to [Hecataeus of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecataeus_of_Miletus), who wrote around the time when the Romans were kicking out the Etruscans and starting their Republic.

The Romans often used “Libya” for the southern continent; _Africa_  is probably a Latinization of a Carthaginian word for their own territory, which itself might come from ancient Libyan — an ancestor of modern Berber. After the Romans defeated Carthage it became the name of the new Roman province (it’s most of modern Tunisia) but gradually got extended to mean the rest of the Maghreb as well.

However, the extent of Africa south of the Sahara was not very well known to the Romans. The Carthaginians [sailed along the west coast of Africa](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/hanno-1-the-navigator/hanno-1-the-navigator-3/), probably as far south as Cameroon, but contact was intermittent. The Sahara was already pretty inhospitable, and camels were not in widespread use until the later Roman period. The Romans had some contact (friendly and not) with the [Meroë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB) in modern Sudan and with various Berber kingdoms in what’s now Morocco.

Interestingly, there was a very old story (which they would have known ) that a Phoenician crew working for an Egyptian pharoah had [sailed all the way around Africa,](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/herodotus/herodotus-on-the-first-circumnavigation-of-africa/) heading south from the Red Sea and returning via the Mediterranean, in the 6th century BC.

_From a 2008 re-enactment of the ancient circumnavigation._ 

That story is completely plausible — but most ancient reporters didn’t believe it. Never having sailed south of the Equator, they didn’t believe that the sun could be seen to the north of a westward-sailing ship; that detail — which makes it very convincing to modern readers — made them believe the Phoenician story was all a wild travelers’ tale. Moreover, many Greek and Roman geographers, observing the increase in temperatures as you head south from the northern hemisphere, suspected that there was no way to reach the southern hemisphere at all: the intervening territory was thought to be too hot to sustain human life (they also had arguments about whether the lands they assumed would lie on the other side of the Equator could have human inhabitants!).
