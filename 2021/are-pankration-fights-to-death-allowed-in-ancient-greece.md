Theoretically, the fights were not supposed to be “to the death,” but serious injuries and deaths were not uncommon. There were very few rules: biting, eye-gouging, and leveraging open a jaw were forbidden but pretty much any other kind of attack was allowed. Strangleholds — with hands, arms, and legs — were all allowed and quite dangerous.

Eventually, the [hellanodikai ](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/TB010EN.html)— the priest-umpires who supervised the fights — imposed a rule the a fighter who died in the ring would be regarded as the __winner .__ This was intended to discouraged killing, though in hyper-competitive Greece it may have also encouraged some poor decision making. [Arrichion](https://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2020/04/death-before-defeat-the-badass-story-of-arrichion-of-phigalia/), one of the greatest Pankratiasts, [died in the ring with his trainer on the sidelines shouting](https://ejmas.com/jcs/jcsart_hollenback_0903.htm) “What a wonderful eulogy you’ll have if one can say ‘_he did not give up at Olympia!’_ ” In that case the opponent actually submitted as Arrichion succumbed to strangulation, rather than losing because of the death-in-the-ring rule, but the end result was the same. Most bouts ended with a submission, indicated by the defeated fighter raising his index finger.
