They tend to be smaller and pointier:

Another important difference is that Nubian pyramids are very close to the local water table — that means it’s [actually possible to scuba dive inside some of them](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-africa-48875686):

The other thing to remember about the Nubian pyramids is that they are much newer than the Egyptian ones: the last pyramid in Egypt was built around 1760 BC; the first one in Nubia almost a thousand years later. The Nubian versions were a very deliberate invocation of an ancient tradition. You can think of it in the same kinds of terms as an eighteenth century French king building a palace out of Roman-style columns and pediments.
