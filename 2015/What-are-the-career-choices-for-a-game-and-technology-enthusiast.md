[Animesh Jha](https://www.quora.com/profile/Animesh-Jha-2)'s answer gibes with my experience. Development is :

__Hard__ . Immovable deadlines, hard problems, limited resources, and a lot of one-off problems that don't have easy off-the-shelf solutions.

__Satisfying__ . It is _never_  true that we sit around playing games all day. Even testers, who theoretically have to do that, spend more time writing up reports and trying to debug things than playing -- and even then, they are often repeating some boring series of actions designed to trigger a bug, rather than playing. All that said, development is very satisfying, because it is so hard -- getting something to come together in spite of the obstacles, and then seeing people enjoy it, is a great feeling.

__Reasonably well paid.__  Although I think a talented programmer can make more in other industries (see [Why do game programmers have lower salaries than regular software engineers?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-game-programmers-have-lower-salaries-than-regular-software-engineers)) the pay in games is pretty good. There is a small chance of getting lucky and making a lot; there is, unfortunately, also a larger chance of having to move on and find a new job if a studio fails.

__Unpredictable__ . Games is a hit driven business, so the rewards go disproportionately to a minority of titles and teams. You can have a good skills, a long track record, and a lot of shipped titles and still have to switch jobs every 3-5 years if you never find a studio with a steady franchise that pays the bills; on the other hand a kid straight out of school can have a huge hit and make a lifetime's worth of money. While that's not common, it lends a little spice to the career. If you are naturally risk averse, though, games is a stressful choice.

__Geographically limited__ . At least in North America, but to some degree in Europe too, games development is clustered in places with good access to tech talent. Easily 75% of US games are made in Seattle, SF, LA or (distant 4th) Austin. It's possible to get games jobs elsewhere, but working for the only studio in a 3-hour radius makes it hard to deal with the ups and downs (see the sad story of [38 Studios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/38_Studios)). In Canada, Montreal and Vancouver monopolize the business.

__Fragmented__ . Game studios are not usually that big. Although monster productions like _Destiny_  or _Assassins Creed_  can have teams of several hundred, most studios are much smaller (50 - 150 for AAA titles, much less for casual and mobile). This is good and bad -- personally, I love the lack of bureaucracy and minimal office politics, but if you want an title or an executive lifestyle the options are very limited. 

__Fun.__ Although we don't sit around playing all days, making monsters and aliens and cartoon critters beats accounting in my book, any day. But that's subjective.

TL;DR : It's not an easy or particularly secure path, but it's not crazy. Its highly competitive and demanding, but more rewarding (IMHO) than more respectable jobs. 

You might want to check out the [International Game Developers Association (IGDA)](http://www.igda.org/) or [Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/) for a look at the business ([Develop](http://www.develop-online.net/in) in the UK) , or go to the [Game Developers Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/).
