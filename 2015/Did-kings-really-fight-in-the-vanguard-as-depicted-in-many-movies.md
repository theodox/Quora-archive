# Did kings really fight in the vanguard as depicted in many movies? Aren't the soldiers fighting in the vanguard most likely to die in the battle? How do vanguard soldiers survive? Are a warrior’s skills in any way related to dodging enemy arrows?

It really did happen. In the days before professional armies and good communications, military leaders had much less fine-grained control over the flow of a battle. The moral effect of "heroic" leadership was, however, much more important-- being seen in the battle, exposing yourself to the same dangers as your men and "inspiring" them with your example were pretty critical forms of motivation. 

Even kings who didn't deign to fight on the battlefield themselves found it important to be seen by their troops: At [Salamis, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis)for example, Xerxes set up a large golden throne on a hillside overlooking the naval battle (it was clearly designed to be seen: this was not general's bunker). As the fight progressed he had scribes by his side taking down the names of commanders he intended to reward after the fight.

Participating directly in the battle was dangerous, but maybe less than it seems. Most premodern armies kept their best troops in elite formations that were assigned personally by the highest ranking commander on the spot -- the large number of regiments with titles like "guards" or "household" in modern armies reflect that heritage. This afforded a certain level of protection to important figures -- but it also meant that the crisis of a battle often involved the leadership directly as the leaders -- or as the targets -- of critical attacks. 

Just to pull a random example from the innumerable options, consider the career of [Edward, the Black Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward,_the_Black_Prince) of England . At [Crécy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cr%C3%A9cy) in 1356, he and his father King Edward III defeated a French army led personally by [Philip VI, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_VI_of_France)who was wounded during the battle. In the same battle [John, the blind king of Bohemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Bohemia) fought despite his disability and was killed on the field:

> ...for all that he was nigh blind, when he understood the order of the battle, he said to them about him: 'Where is the lord Charles my son?' His men said: 'Sir, we cannot tell; we think he be fighting.' Then he said: 'Sirs, ye are my men, my companions and friends in this journey: I require you bring me so far forward, that I may strike one stroke with my sword.' They said they would do his commandment, and to the intent that they should not lose him in the press, they tied all their reins of their bridles each to other and set the king before to accomplish his desire, and so they went on their enemies. The lord Charles of Bohemia his son, who wrote himself king of Almaine and bare the arms, he came in good order to the battle; but when he saw that the matter went awry on their party, he departed, I cannot tell you which way. The king his father was so far forward that he strake a stroke with his sword, yea and more than four, and fought valiantly and so did his company; and they adventured themselves so forward, that they were there all slain, and the next day they were found in the place about the king, and all their horses tied each to other.

According to legend the personal arms of the Prince of Wales take their motto ("Ich Dien,"-"I serve" in German) from John of Bohemia's own.

And.. a decade later at [ Poitiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Poitiers) in 1356, the Black Prince again command the English forces which captured [John II of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_II_of_France) and his son, the future [Philip the Bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_the_Bold) on the battlefield (the immediate heir, the future [Charles V ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V_of_France)was ordered off the field by his father, avoiding a complete capture of the French royal house).

​_Probably not accurate, but this depicts the black prince (in red) fighting personally with the Dauphin Charles (in blue) at Poitier. Note the crowns on their helmets._ 

One thing that Hollywood does get wrong is the timing. The commitment of a guards unit or the personal intervention of the king was usually not the _opening_  of a battle: kings might fight but they would rarely be the out in front of the first line on approach. Besides the obvious dangers, it would be impossible to exercise any control over the battle at all from the middle of the melee. The commitment of the household troops was usually reserved for a finishing blow -- an effort to exploit a weakness or to push a weakening enemy into a rout. So it would typically be held back until a critical moment in the battle rather than unleashed right at the outset.

There were, of course, exceptions: for example, Alexander the Great led an early infantry attack on foot at [Issus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Issus) but then rejoined his Companion cavalry and lead the final assault against Emperor Darius on horseback. Alexander, however, was famously heedless of his own safety on the field.
