The Rubicon was a line of political demarcation, not a military or logistical obstacle. It marked the boundary between Caesar’s legally assigned province and the rest of Italia. By crossing the border Caesar formally put himself outside the law — ordinarily a Roman general was forbidden to lead troops under arms outside his assigned province.

In any case, Caesar’s route didn’t need to be on the fastest route from France; he spent the winter of 50/49 in his (legal) province of [Gallia Cisalpina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisalpine_Gaul), which we would recognize as northern Italy. Here he was monitoring events in Rome closely while remaining more-or-less on the right side of the law. His authority was legally supposed to include Gallia Cisalpina, [Gallia Transalpina ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallia_Narbonensis)(modern Provence) and [Illyricum ](https://www.livius.org/articles/people/illyrians/dalmatia/)(Dalmatia). He made his headquarters in Ravenna, which was the closest city in his domain to the terminus of the [Via Flaminia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Flaminia), which ended at Ariminum (Rimini). This put his messengers within a few days ride of Rome (as the crisis brewed, his ally Curio made the ride from Rome to Caesar in just over three days: a distance of about 160 miles, probably a bruising experience).

_Caesar’s route from Ravenna to Rome. The main route to France ran straight WNW along the back of the Appenines. Other Roman roads are visible in light brown. Note the mountains: more important obstacles than rivers for Caesar’s troops, but also the boundary between his province and Italia._ 

Once Caesar had decided to “[roll the dice](https://www.latinitium.com/blog/iacta-alea-est)” and break decisively with the legal authorities, his line of march was obviously the same road — to reach it, however, he had to cross the Rubicon both figuratively and literally. The Rubicon itself was no big obstacle — it’s famously shallow, and in [Lucan’s iconic telling](https://www.bartleby.com/270/5/336.html) of the story his army simply waded across.

For what it’ s worth, there’s no clear agreement about bridges on the Arno during this period but the river was regularly crossed. There was a crossing at Pisae (Pisa) near the mouth of the river and another north of Arretium (Arezzo) farther upstream; the first was a regular part of the Via Aurelia and the second of the Via Cassia. It’s likely that the river was fordable or easily crossed at Fiorentia (Florence) — Caesar himself founded the Roman colony at Florence in 59, probably to keep an eye on a useful crossing — but we don’t think there was a permanent bridge until the imperial period.
