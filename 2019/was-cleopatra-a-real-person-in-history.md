Yes — there’s no question of her historicity. In addition to the [famous contemporary literary sources](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195389661/obo-9780195389661-0130.xml), there are hundreds of inscriptions and thousands of coins like this one:

_The inscription reads ΒΑCΙΛΙCCΑ ΚΛΕΟΠΑΤΡΑ, “Queen Cleopatra” in Greek._ 

There are even mentions of her in contemporary private letters — the famous Roman orator Cicero, for example, left a peevish letter complaining that she was a rude and imperious neighbor during her stay in Rome.

So: yes, Cleopatra was real. Many of the stories that circulate about her are more or less embroidered, but she was a real person with a very obvious historical footprint.
