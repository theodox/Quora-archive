This map gives a pretty good depiction:

The furthest west was the oasis of Siwa, where [he had himself proclaimed “son of Zeus”.](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised) The furthest east was the [Beas River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beas_River) in Punjab, where his troops mutinied and refused to go further. From there they went down the Indus, part of the army returning to Mesopotamia by sea, Alexander and the rest crossing the [desert of Gedrosia in Baluchistan](http://www.livius.org/sources/content/arrian/anabasis/alexander-in-the-gedrosian-desert/). The farthest north was [Alexandria Eschate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Eschate) in what’s now Tajikistan.
