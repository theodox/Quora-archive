# How were Roman forts defended against attacks? Their walls seem rather low, ladders could easily climb them if used properly. Were scorpios and bows used to defend from range?

Generally Roman frontier forts were only intended to defend against raiding parties and bandits, not full on assaults by well equipped professional army. On the northern frontiers — in Scotland, along the Rhine, and the Danube — the “barbarian” side of the border was marked by political fragmentation and little urbanism, which meant nobody had the money or the workshops to put together a serious siege train. On those frontiers the typical fort was a tripwire: strong enough to scare off small raids and to protect the garrison long enough to summon a Roman field army. Most of these installations were forts, not fortresses.

It’s not as if the Romans didn’t know how to build them bigger. In the east, where the Parthians and then the Sassanids had the skills and the equipment necessary for a full-dress siege, the frontier fortifications were a lot more impressive. However these were areas with a long history of urbanization, so the nodes of the defense were cities like Samosata, Zeugma, and Dura-Europos. Most of these had significant fortifications going back to the Hellenistic period or before, augmented with Roman engineering. Since this area had a long history of conflict these sites were typically located on particularly defensible terrain.

Even in the east, however, Roman doctrine focused on mobile field armies and not static defenses. The fortress cities had garrisons but the key legionary bases were outside the cities, connected instead to the roads and the network of depots which made it possible for them to maneuver.
