Game programming is a very specialized subset of programming, and the practices and tribal knowledge vary enormously from company to company and even from team to team, which makes it hard for a newcomer to slot in gracefully. 

Larger companies have more established forums for bringing in younger people, socializing them, and training them to be productive without getting under the feet of the production teams. This is good, since it provides a more welcoming environment than you're likely to get from an over-tasked production coder who is more focused on meeting deadlines than on making you feel welcome. On the other hand, it's not uncommon to end up in an "intern playground" with fairly un-challenging tasks, isolated from the real work of making games. 

I'm at a medium-sized company (60-ish people) where we don't have the kind of HR and corporate infrastructure to really support young coders in a formal way, so our bar is _very_ high. The main things we are asking when we hear from someone are:

__How much handholding is this going to involve?__ Without dedicated mentoring and education help, (of the sort you might get at [EA University](http://careers.ea.com/students)) anybody we take on is going to be handed to a one or two very busy people with a lot of things to do. The most important thing we'd want, honestly, is not to be too bothered. Unfornately that means we'd be looking for the proverbial "self starter", somebody who can be given a task and will get ti done with minimal oversight and without requiring a lot of help. This is, of course, not the ideal proposition from the intern's point of view, since it's that limits the educational opportunities. Like I said: small companies aren't the best environments for an intern! 

__Do I have any grunt work I can offload?__ Part of the calculus for us is that their are some tasks which need a high degree of technical knowledge, but which are not particularly fun or rewarding or challenging. Poring over memory dumps looking for evidence of a leak, or unifying the 5 different styles of logging messages from the build system, or porting a library that's built on an out-of-date set of DLLs and needs to be upgraded are the kinds of things that many programmers long to be free of and will happily hand to some poor intern. That sort of things come with the territory.

__Is this person highly, highly motivated?__  Games attracts a lot of casual attention -- people who think it will be "fun" compared to, say, writing database queries. Unfortunately that results in a lot of resumes coming in, which inclines us to be very picky. We'll usually be looking for all sorts of impressive credentials: good grades, professorial recommendations, shipped indie games, and so on. That's not because those things are actually required for intern level work -- as I said, that's often pretty simple stuff -- but because we want to screen out the 90+% of the candidates who are either just 'interested in games' or will need more in mentoring than they give back in actual work. Anything you can do to prove that you work _yourself_ hard is going to make you stand out from the large number of casual candidates.
 
Reviewing these bullets, it strikes me that big companies are generally better targets than small ones because they are more likely to take a long view: they have the money and infrastructure to at least think about grooming a young coder for a couple of years before bringing them in for real. They are also likelier to have diversity programs and relationships with schools or other programs that might take account of other factors than just raw coding experience or hyper-motivated over-achieving drive.

On the other hand some _smaller_  companies -- teams of 5, 10, 15 - may be easier to reach because small teams are often desperate for help. It's much less likely that a tiny team can really put much effort into mentoring, but they are the most likely to throw you right into the real trenches. This is going to be very situational -- very small companies are very unlikely to have dedicated resources or programs for mentoring and it may really require persistence, networking and luck to get an opportunity. 

You might find this generally useful: It's written for game artists but most of the same considerations apply:
