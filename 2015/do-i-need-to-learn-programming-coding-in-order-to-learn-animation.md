Not at all. Most animators use off-the-shelf software like [Maya LT ](http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya-lt/overview)or [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) or [Source Filmmaker](http://www.sourcefilmmaker.com/) without ever learning to program. It certainly helps if you have good computer skills and are a good learner, but animation is a very different field.
