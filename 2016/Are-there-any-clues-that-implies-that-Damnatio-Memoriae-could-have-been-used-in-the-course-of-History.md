If you mean 'can we tell if something has been systematically suppressed', the answer is usually yes: even in the 20th century, with vastly greater resources, governments have almost always failed to completely suppress the evidence of people they wanted 'disappeared':

_Trotsky (center-right here, though nowhere else!) is airbrushed out -- but the original still survived in many copies._ 

Ancient states, with far fewer ways to re-write the record, were even less subtle. They could deface an inscription or remove a statue, but they didn't have the time, money or manpower to hunt down every trace of a disgraced figure. The best example would be the case of [Akhenaten,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten) the heretic Pharoah who attacked the traditional religion.

_Akhenaten' face and his royal cartouche deliberately erased by his successors_  

While his victorious enemies went to great lengths to remove him -- ceremonially defacing his images and erasing his name -- they still left plenty of evidence behind, including some works that are now famous:

In the Roman world there are many examples. One of the showiest cases is [Geta ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geta_(emperor))who had the bad luck to be the brother of [Caracalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla) and was erased (along with about 20,000 other people) in 211*

The practice was somewhat paradoxical in its Roman form since the whole thing was a big, showy, public act: unlike an Orwellian memory hole, _damnatio_  was done out in the open: it was a form of shaming rather than an attempt to rewrite history. And it was used fairly often ([this article](http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/damnatio-memoriae/) counts about 30 different cases). Frequently the damnatio was also a genuine reflection of popular feeling -- like the demolition of the Berlin Wall or the toppling of Saddam's statues:

> How delightful it was, to smash to pieces those arrogant faces, to raise our swords against them, to cut them ferociously with our axes, as if blood and pain would follow our blow

_- Pliny, describing the vandalism of statues of Domitian after the latter's death._ 

_* It's a sad fact that one of the crowning achievements of Roman statecraft, the_ _[Constitutio Antoniniana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutio_Antoniniana)_ _which granted equal citizenship to all free-born inhabitants of the empire regardless of nationality in 212, was in part a propaganda move by the unpopular Caracalla to help palliate the distaste left by his treatment of his brother._
