The standard dodge for a question like this, of course, is to define your terms. “If you define greatness as….” &c &c. It’s a healthy exercise, up to a point.

However in this case I’d start with how Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Μέγας got his name to begin with. Μέγας in Greek is not really a philosophical construct with a neat conceptual framework. If you [look the word up in a Greek dictionary ](https://lsj.gr/wiki/%CE%BC%CE%AD%CE%B3%CE%B1%CF%82)you’ll see that it’s literally the word for “big.” It means something extraordinary — it can be “striking” or “splendid” or even “loud.” There are certainly conventional uses that correspond to our “the Great”. But the core meaning is just… __more__ .

If you remember the original [Batman: The Dark Knight Returns](https://amzn.to/3dm6QJZ), you might remember the scene where [Commissioner Yindel ](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Ellen_Yindel)finally has the chance to take down Batman, whom she regards as a dangerous vigilante.

But she can’t do it.

The English word actually contains the same tension, though two centuries of advertising has drummed the older meaning out of most of our heads and we now use it mostly as a mark of _approval_  rather than of _measure_ .

The Greeks may have admired civilized polish but they also had a built in respect for sheer _animality._ A Homeric hero like Achilles isn’t a hero because he’s an example of high moral character or inherent nobility: he’s simply the most dangerous man on the battlefield even though he’s also a self-centered, insubordinate, arrogant brat. He fights for glory and loot, not for truth, justice, or the Achaean way. Yet to the Greeks he’s θεοῖς ἐπιείκελος, “like unto the gods.”

Not because he’s saintly: because — like the gods — he’s terrifying.

Against that background — (it’s worth remembering that Alexander believed himself to be a lineal descendant of Achilles and was obsessed with Homer) — Alexander might not be a great person but he is unquestionably ὁ Μέγας. The Greek world had been living in terror of the Persian monolith for a century and a half when Alexander and his little army offered sacrifice to the shade of Achilles in the ruins of Troy. Five years later the Persian empire had vanished like a mirage. Alexander celebrated his thirtieth birthday three and a half thousand miles from home, at the head of an all-conquering army in lands that were not even myths and legends back home.

Alexander personally upended the order of his world. This was not an impersonal, industrial process like the Second World War, either: the fact that [his empire fell apart almost immediately on his death ](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-the-descendants-of-Alexander-the-Great/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=01040a68&srid=zLvM)just underscores how completely this entire enterprise depended on one person.

If the question is, _was Alexander a better person than most?_  the answer is no — he killed a lot of people and took their stuff because he could. He was far from the worst conqueror, in his age or later — but he was not a saint.

If the question is, _did Alexander advance the progress of mankind?_ the answer is, only accidentally. His conquests set in motion a long and complex chain of cultural exchanges that helped forge the modern world, but that’s our good luck rather than his inspiration. There is a school of thought (championed particularly by [W. W. Tarn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Woodthorpe_Tarn), but also, rather amusingly, by [medieval Persian poetry](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama-of-nezami)) that sees Alexander as an enlightened Great Man on a mission to unify mankind. Me, I don’t buy it.

Ultimately, Alexander’s career is simply staggering in a completely amoral way. It’s Great in the same way that the [Great Plains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains) or the [Great Barrier Reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef) are Great: its __too big to ignore.__
