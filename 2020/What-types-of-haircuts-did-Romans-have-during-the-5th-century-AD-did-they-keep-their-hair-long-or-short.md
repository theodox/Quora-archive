5th century fashion for men was typically straightish, probably oiled “mop top” hair with bangs:

Coins frequently show a longer section at the back: not only was the empire falling apart, it was also _adopting the mullet —_ a far greater setback for civilization.

_A coin of Theodosius, Honorius’ father, showing the fashion for a little extra party in the back._ 

Longer cuts seem to have been curled inwards, similar to some medieval fashions and possibly for the same reason, since this period saw Romans adopting [peaked helmets ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Roman_ridge_helmet)similar to medieval spangenhelms — if this originated as a military fashion in might reflect the need for hair that worked under a more closed-in helmet:

_A late-Roman soldier — possibly, Rome’s last great general, Flavius Aetius, showing the curled in fashion in mens hair._ 

It appears that the early fifth-century fashion was for rather exaggeratedly straightened hair, as in the examples above. Of course, the late Roman fashion for simplified graphic shapes in all media has some impact on that presentation. There are examples from later which keep the same general layout but include curlier styles.

_A consular diptych from 487, a decade after the lapse of the empire in the west, showing the return of curly hair. Coincidence?_

Beards were not entirely unknown, though in general the fashion was clean shaven.

In color sources beards often show up associated with white hair, so its likely that they were the fashion for older more “distinguished” men, though in the example below you can see that Joseph (4th from right in the lower register) has a beard too.
