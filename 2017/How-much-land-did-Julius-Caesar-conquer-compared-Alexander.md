Alexander’s conquests are usually estimated at about 5 million square kilometers. Caesars conquest of Gaul only covered less than 750,000 square kilometers. You could make a good case that he ‘conquered’ the entire Roman empire, which would put the number between 3 and 4 million depending on how you count Egypt, which was formally independent but essentially under Caesars’ control.
