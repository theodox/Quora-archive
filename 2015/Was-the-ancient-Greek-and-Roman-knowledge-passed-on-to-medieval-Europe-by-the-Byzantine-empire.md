Latin literature primarily preserved in western Europe exclusively; there was some degree of persistence in Spain and Arab-occupied Sicily. Many Greek authors were preserved in Latin translations: For example bits and pieces of Plato were preserved through Cicero's translation of the_[Timaeus](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-timaeus/)_ _,_ pieces of Euclid through [Boethius](http://www.amazon.com/mediaeval-Latin-translation-Euclids-Elements/dp/3515046283), and so on. As the other answers note, the primary preservers of the Latin texts were monasteries, although some wealthy kings also built libraries and encouraged preservation: for example, [Charlemagne](http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/author/carol1.htm) and Emperor [Otto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottonian_Renaissance). 

Greek literature was never entirely lost in the west, but the level of Greek literacy was pretty low. Some manuscripts did circulate, and some scholars could still read Greek (the New Testament, of course, and many important early church works were in Greek so theologians and church historians in southern Italy and Sicily (on-and-off parts of the Byzantine Empire) still had contact with the living language, and there was also some Greek learning preserved in Ireland and parts of northwest Europe with Irish monastic influence. Even so the number of readers and books was very small outside of Southern Italy -- even a very well educated man like [Petrarch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch), who actually owned Greek manuscript of Homer, couldn't read it. 

A lot of second-hand knowledge of Greek authors -- most notably of Aristotle, Galen, and Ptolemy the geographer -- came the through Moorish Spain and Sicily. These were sometimes straight translations and sometimes commentaries or epitomes prepared by Arab scholars such as [Avicenna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna) or by Spanish Jews like [Maimonide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides)s. Translations of these works into Latin were very important but they were generally heavily filtered. From around the year 1000 through the mid-14th century, these kinds of multi-cultural Greco-Arabic-Spanish-Jewish sources were the primary way westerners learned about Greek subjects.

As Italian city-states became more wealthy, powerful and cultured from the 13th century on, they had increasing commercial contact with the Greek east. The Renaissance taste for ancient learning started off with interest in Latin literature and Roman history, but spread very quickly to include Greek subjects as well. Dante, for example, knew a few words of Greek and included many figures from Greek mythology in the _Inferno_ (completed 1320). With more wealth and power the Italians bought (or stole) a lot of material from Greek libraries -- Venice, in particular, acquired a lot of territory from the Byzantines and became a conduit for many manuscripts. 

The Byzantines, of course, has been conserving and preserving the Greek tradition all along: although they didn't expend much effort on exporting this material to the West (relations were generally pretty frosty between "Latins" from the West and Byzantines) they were, ultimately, the ones who made sure that the original material survived into the 16th century where the combination of increased interest, more widespread literacy and printing made sure the information would be preserved.
