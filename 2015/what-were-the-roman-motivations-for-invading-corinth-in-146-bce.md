The TLDR is: the Achaean League quite foolishly declared war on the Romans at a particularly bad time.

 The story really starts with the rebellion of [Andriscus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriscus), an imposter who claimed to be the heir to the throne of Macedonia. Not only did Andriscus fight the Roman sponsored government of Macedonia, he also tried to forge an alliance with Rome's arch-enemy Carthage. This was not a wise move: the Romans were already headed for a lopsided victory in the [Third Punic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Punic_War), but anything which looked good for their old foes was sure to draw their anger. So, when Andriscus was defeated in 148 , the Romans reduced Macedonia to a province, ending it's independence.

Rome was already the most powerful player in Greek affairs. After the [Second Macedonian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Macedonian_War) ended in 197, they Romans had pursued a hands-off policy guaranteeing the freedom and independence of the various Greek powers (a policy which was generally popular with the Greeks). However in the [Third Macedonian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Macedonian_War) (ended 168) they behaved much more high-handedly and vindictively (among other things, taking huge numbers of slaves from Macedonia and western Greece) . That cruelty created a powerful anti-Roman sentiment in many Greek cities. There's also some evidence that anti-Roman agitation was part of a class conflict, since the Romans were a status-quo power: they were more interested in stability than social justice.

The occupation of Macedonia after the fall of Andriscus inflamed the anti-Roman parties. The immediate cause of actual fighting was dispute between the [Achaean League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaean_League) -- nominally a Roman ally -- and their long term rivals in Sparta. When Rome refused to recognize the League's claimss against Sparta, the league declared war on Rome. This was, militarily, a hopeless and impulsive decision, as the subsequent war showed: the Greek historian Polybius, who knew most of the actors on both sides personally, had nothing but contempt for the populist politicians who engineered the war. 

The Achaeans were defeated quickly. The destruction of Corinth was a brutal climax to a war that was otherwise not a serious threat to Roman power: the Romans reserved their worst for states they regarded as faithless allies, and the League fit that bill.
