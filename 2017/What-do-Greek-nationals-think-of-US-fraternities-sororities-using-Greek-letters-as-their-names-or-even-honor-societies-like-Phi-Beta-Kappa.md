Well, I can't speak for contemporary Greeks but there is an often reported story about my grand-uncles on a visit being driven across the campus of the university of Bridgeport in the 1930’s and berating my grandfather for not making it big like all the rich Greeks with fancy houses who put their initials out on the front lawn for all to see.

“"What's the matter with you, why can't you be a _man_  like that Kappa Sigma?”
