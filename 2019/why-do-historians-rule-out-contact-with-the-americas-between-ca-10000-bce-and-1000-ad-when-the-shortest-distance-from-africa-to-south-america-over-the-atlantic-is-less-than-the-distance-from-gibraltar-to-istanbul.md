# Why do historians rule out contact with the Americas between ca. 10000 BCE and 1000 AD, when the shortest distance from Africa to South America over the Atlantic is less than the distance from Gibraltar to Istanbul when sailing the Mediterranean?

There are two basic thing to consider here.

__Supplies.__  The distance from Gibraltar to Istanbul (in 1000, from Al Andalus to Constantinople) may be longer, but the entire trip can be accomplished without ever losing sight of land. This simplifies matters enormously for a ship propelled by wind and human rowers (and oar-power was still common in the Mediterranean well into the 18th century) because crews need to be fed and watered.

Each of these Roman amphoras holds about 40 liters of water: enough for 8 men for one day, so these 12 would handle a crew of about a hundred for one day. To make a crossing like the one from the Azores to the new world could easily take a month, so your 100-person crew would need 360 of these just for water — not to mention food and other supplies. Even if you knew there was a landfall on the other side of the ocean — which nobody did, at least as far as we can tell — safely provisioning a trip out of sight of land would be expensive.

For ancient ships propelled by hungry, thirsty rowers, places to rest and refit were critical. In historic times the Carthaginians effectively barred Greek and Roman ships from the Atlantic for centuries simply by denying them landing rights in Spain and North Africa west of Malta.

Blue-water sailing without magnetic compasses and celestial navigation is also incredibly difficult. Before the 15th century only true navigational badasses — the Polynesians and the Vikings — voluntarily ventured out of sight of land for long. And both of those peoples learned their trades in places where islands were plentiful — unlike the mid-Atlantic.

__Currents and winds__ . The other problem is what’s known as the [North Atlantic Gyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Gyre) — a vast circular current (with accompanying winds) which rotates clockwise in the North Atlantic. If you’re coming from north of the equator and heading west the trip is actually doable, even with Greek or Roman or Phoenician sailing techniques — assuming you know it can be done and don’t mind stocking a month’s worth of food and water.

The problem is _coming back_ : sailing against the gyre is a slog at best: wind and current are against you the whole way. So if some ancient old-world mariners ever did wash up in the Caribbean the likelihood that they could make it back to tell the tale is almost zero. The efficient way to return is not to simply head back east, but to follow the gulf stream all the way to Newfoundland and then across to Ireland or England, a journey of many months. When Columbus was considering his plan to go west, he investigated stories about people from “Cathay” washing up on the shores of Galway — these were probably North Americans who survived a storm-driven trip across the North Atlantic courtesy of the Gyre.

So: the odds were not good for two-way trans-Atlantic travel before the 15th century. The Norsemen made it, but the tenuous nature of their American adventure speaks for itself: the trip was too hard and the rewards to small to tempt even people who were famously eager to get out of their cold, cramped homes in Scandinavia. It’s entirely possible that individuals made the trip one way, probably driven by storms rather than a desire for adventure.

For context, the trip around Africa is vastly easier than an open-water round trip across the Atlantic. The feat was [first accomplished 2500 years ago](https://www.quora.com/Did-Ancient-Egyptians-circumnavigate-the-continent-of-Africa-How-difficult-is-it/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&share=9a7a0248&srid=zLvM). However it was incredibly difficult: it took a Phoenician crew three years, leaving from the Red Sea and returning via the Pillars of Hercules. The rewards, in the end, were not enticing enough to encourage a repeat trip for almost 2000 years… and the Phoenicians at least had land in sight the whole way.
