Is hardly impossible to be a successful writer in a second language: consider [Joseph Conrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad), whose native language was Polish, or [Vladimir Nabokov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Nabokov) -- both of whom are accomplished English stylists despite being from Poland and Russia respectively. [Jorge Luis Borges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges), one of the greatest names of 20th century Spanish literature grew up speaking English at home. Sometimes an outsider can have insights into the spirit of a language that a native speaker overlooks. 

On a less exalted level my wife is Chinese, but she makes her living as a lawyer here in the States: reading and writing are her profession and she's very good at both -- she often has to work hard to convince her clients that she is, in fact, from China and not an Asian-American. He secret is simple: she reads a lot.

The best technique for any aspiring writer is just to do a lot of reading. To learn the music of a language, you have to read a lot of it: fiction and non-fiction, essays, drama and poetry can all teach you important truths about how English works. You may find that a mix of reading and listening to audio books is a more useful than reading alone: there's a reason most writers work hard to find a "voice," a unique and personal way of expressing themselves. Most young writers in any language start with imitation, trying hard to sound like their favorite authors; that's a fine place to start as long as you eventually grow out of pure imitation. 

Bloggers might not be the best choice if you want to develop a professional voice. Blogging encourages an interesting 'semi-formal' style and a conversational tone which isn't right for all situations. A mix of novels, good non-fiction and dramas will expose you to a much wider range of tones and modes of expression. 

There are lots of online writers' groups where aspiring writers go to critique each others work. The internet can be a nasty place so you will probably have to shop around to find a friendly and supportive community -- hopefully one that where your fellow writers will tell you honestly what is working and what is not. 

Above all, don't get discouraged. The grammar and vocabulary will eventually become automatic for you, since they are just matters of practice. Finding something you want actually say is the hard part, but that's true in any language. Good luck!
