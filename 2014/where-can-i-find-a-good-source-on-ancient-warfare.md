[Ancient Warfare](http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/) Magazine is a Dutch publication (in English) that comes out bi-monthly. It tends to focus on one theme per issue, so the choice of topics can be a bit random, but it also includes book reviews and ads from specialist booksellers
