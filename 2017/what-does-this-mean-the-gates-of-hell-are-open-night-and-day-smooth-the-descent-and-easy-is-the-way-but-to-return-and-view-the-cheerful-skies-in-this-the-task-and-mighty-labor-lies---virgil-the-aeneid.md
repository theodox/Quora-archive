# What does this mean? “The gates of hell are open night and day; Smooth the descent, and easy is the way: But to return, and view the cheerful skies, In this the task and mighty labor lies.” ― Virgil, The Aeneid

“Hell” might not be the right translation here, or maybe it gives the wrong impression.

Here’s a more literal version that might make the meaning a little more clear:

_Facilis descensus Averno; 
Noctes atque dies patet atri ianua Ditis; 
Sed revocare gradum superasque evadere ad auras, 
Hoc opus, hic labor est._ 

It’s easy to go down into Avernus.
Night and day, the dark door of Dis stands open
But to retrace the way and return to the upper airs:
_This_  is the matter; _this_ is the work.

__Avernus__ is a volcanic crater near the Bay of Naples, where Roman tradition placed an entrance into the underworld; __Dis__  was the Roman version of Hades, the god of the dead.

As a volcanic crater, Avernus was full of noxious fumes (the name means “without birds” — they died from the gasses). So one layer of the imagery is about going down into the crater, from which it’s hard to come back. But if the crater is also the entrance to the realm of the dead… that’s even harder.
