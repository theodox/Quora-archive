# It is widely recognized the importance of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle to the emergence of Modern West. The question is: were these philosophers as important and well-known in the ancient world as they were (are) for the Modernity?

Yes. Their relative reputations had ups and downs, but Plato and Aristotle remained touchstones for pretty much everybody touched by the Greek philosophical tradition down until the 19th century. Socrates tended to be relegated to the role of “Plato’s mouthpiece” but his name never fell out out circulation entirely (Dante, for example, included him among the “virtuous Pagans” of Limbo alongside Plato and Aristotle, even though Plato’s works were not yet circulating in translation in Italy)

I’ll slightly exaggerate to make the trends clear, and it’s worth bracketing all of this with the reminder that between the 5th century and the 15th most Aristotelians and Platonists were working from translated excerpts and commentaries, rather than reading the originals: most of the time “Plato” and “Aristotle” were composite figures who stood in for large and sometimes fractious families of philosophical thought.

For the first few hundred years after their deaths, Plato and Aristotle’s legacy lived on in the [Academy of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_Academy). Although the Academy didn’t devote itself to propagating either Aristotle or Plato’s views exclusively it never lost sight of them, and several Academic philosophers in the Hellenistic and early Roman periods attempted to find ways to find a synthesis of Platonic idealism with Aristotelian empiricism and logical precision.

Generally speaking, Aristotle’s reputation went into eclipse in later antiquity, from about the third century on. Plato’s stock, on the other hand, rose around the same time. The most influential school of philosophy in late Roman / early Byzantium was [Neo-Platonism](http://www.iep.utm.edu/neoplato/), which expanded on Plato’s metaphysics in ways that were very congenial to Gnostic, Christian, Jewish and eventually Islamic thinkers.

Aristotle began a slow comeback around the sixth century, and by the 11th century or so his star was in the ascendant. To many in the Islamic, Jewish and increasingly the Latin Christian traditions he was simply “the Philosopher.” However the Greek tradition, which never depended on translations, was less affected by oscillation of the Plato-Aristotle pendulum.

Aristotle was in the ascendant throughout the earlier Middle Ages, but the revival of Greek learning in the west in the late 1300’s brought Plato back into the spotlight. Plato’s literary quality appealed to the humanists (ie, professional writers) of the Renaissance and his grand metaphysics provided an emotionally satisfying scaffold for a number of philosophical projects, in particular the idea of a [Chain of Being](https://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/Tillyard01.html) and any number of utopian political programs.
