Yes. Here he is in his full regalia:

_The Via Labicana Augustus is a statue (now in the Museo Nazionale Romano) of the emperor in his role as pontifex maximus. Photo:_ _[Ryan Freisling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Labicana_Augustus#/media/File:CaesarAugustusPontiusMaximusCloseup.jpg)_ 

Augustus took the title of [pontifex maximus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifex_maximus) — the same title that’s still held by the Pope! — in 12 BC. It’s worth noting that he was around 50 at the time; the ageless face on that statue reflects his preferred form propaganda, which drew heavily on conventional depictions of Apollo.

Augustus had surely eyed the job while he still resembled the handsome adolescent in the statue. His adoptive father Julius Caesar had been pontifex maximus — winning the post had been his first great political coup. It was as pontifex that he reformed the Roman calendar. His priestly role was an important prop of his political stature. Naturally, his heir was eager to pull the toga over his own head* in imitation — particularly since (in contrast to Caesar) Augustus was conventionally pious, at least in public.

Augustus always stuck to old ways — subverting and then privatizing the Roman Republic, naturally, excepted. So, he waited until his insubstantial co-conspirator [Lepidus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aemilius_Lepidus_(triumvir))(who had nabbed the title during the frenzied deal-making that followed Caesar’s death) finally went to join the gods before taking the office for himself.

Even before he had the title, Augustus lavished money on the gods — building a dozen new temples and restoring more than eighty others. He sponsored a lot of prominent religious art, notably the [Ara Pacis](https://www.archeoroma.org/sites/ara-pacis/).

Not coincidentally the temples, statues, and festivals featured a positive and reassuring image of Augustus himself.

_The not-yet Augustus — the title was three years in the future — is the the first male figure from the left, here with his extended family in the most demure Roman tradition, on the Ara Pacis. You’ll note he looks only a bit younger than the first image, though the Ara predates the statue by almost twenty years.

Upon assuming the priesthood he proved his fidelity to Roman religious tradition in the most visible way possible: by [collecting books of prophecy or revelation that might proved inspiring to opponents of his new order and having them burned.](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#31) Approved texts were retained — under lock and key. This was very much inline with the [traditional Roman suspicion of any religious expression outside the control of the state](https://www.quora.com/How-would-history-change-if-the-status-quo-of-religion-in-the-Roman-Empire-persisted/answer/Steve-Theodore).



* You can usually recognize the officiating priest in Roman art because he’ll have his toga pulled up over his head like a shawl as in this picture. The primary exception is the _flamen Dialis,_ the chief priest of Jupiter, who wears something that looks like a German _pickelhaube._
