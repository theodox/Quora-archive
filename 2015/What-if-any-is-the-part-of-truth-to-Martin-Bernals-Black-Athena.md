On the macro level, Bernal has one good point.

It was widely accepted in antiquity that the cultural and political boundaries between Greece, the Near East, and Egypt were much more fluid than they were in the imaginations of the 19th century classicists he loves to complain about. Herodotus (who is one of Bernal's biggests sources) is very frank in attributing key elements of Greek religion to Egyptian influences, Greek literacy to Phoenicians. Famous Greek thinkers like [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) and [Solon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon) were widely believed to have travelled to Egypt and learned from its wise men.

_Alexander the Great as Amun, complete with ram's horns._ 

Many Greeks paid court to important non-Greek traditions. Alexander the Great famously proclaimed himself as the [son of 'Zeus-Ammon' in the oasis of Siwa](http://www.greece.org/alexandria/alexander/Pages/siwa.html) -- but the Spartans, in particular, also venerated that particular shrine. Several "Olympian" gods had well-known non-Greek origin: Apollo and Artemis originated in Phrygia, and Dionysus was believed to have come either "from the East" or sometimes from [Nysa ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nysa_(mythology))in Aethiopia (his mother is Semele, a daughter of Cadmus -- himself, traditionally, a Phoenician not a Greek). Early Greeks were pretty fuzzy on geography out of sight of the Mediterranean — they often talk as if India and Africa were connected — so Dionysus while not Greek isn't really a 'black Greek God' as he's sometimes described. He does, however, frequently appear dressed in company with a leopard or panther:

which certainly underlines his exotic origins. Poseidon was fond of hanging out in Aethiopia — in the opening of the Odyssey, he’s attending a party there. Andromeda, the princess rescued by Perseus, was an Aethiopian princess.

That’s hardly an exhaustive link. Greece grew up in the shadow of older, more civilized societies and — at least until the aftermath of Alexander’s conquests really went to people’s heads — understood that many important cultural achievements were imported from abroad. Bernal is right to emphasize that the boundary between 'Greek' and 'Near Eastern' (or as he likes to put it 'Afro-asiatic') culture was porous.

It's also worth remembering how small-scale the ancient world was; most Greek cities were the size of a middling American state university. In that kind of world a small number of people could wield outsize power and influence. A tightly knit group could often impose its will on a surrounding majority -- creating the appearance of a huge cultural shift when in fact the life of around them was mostly unchanged: the classical example would be Sparta, where true 'Spartans' were less than 1/7th of the whole population.

In that kind of environment an emigre community with valuable skills or knowledge could have a huge impact on the culture without significantly changing the gene pool (this is a valuable corrective to the 19th century view that Bernal criticizes, which tended to attribute all cultural shifts to the movements of 'races'). So it's totally conceivable --though far from proven -- that the myth cycle surrounding Thebes, say, reflects some concrete influence from Egyptians. The influence of an Egyptian emigre clan that _may_  be how Oedipus got his sphinx.

The ancient world was definitely more multicultural than the sanitized, sand-blasted white statues we see in museums would make us expect: this fresco from the "[Palace of Nestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Nestor) " at Pylos certainly seems to depict an African in the role of a rhapsode (complete with lyre) about 400 years _before_  Homer:

Even some oddball legends may be distorted echoes of contact with distant shores-- Homer's tale of pygmies battling giant cranes, for example, could easily be a third hand effort to describe an ostrich hunt in Africa. Small amounts of Egyptian and Near Eastern art and manufactured goods have been found in archaic Greek sites

All of that means Bernal does make a useful contribution by reminding us that it's not all Parthenons and Platonism, and that that ancient world didn't fit neatly into 19th century boxes.

However, his larger claims aren't very tenable and require large leaps of faith.

In an effort to correct 19th century Eurocentrism he tends to veer towards an even more dubious Afrocentrism. He has to posit the existence of large body of cultural influence which has managed to leave only the most subtle and ambiguous of traces -- and which is somehow still supposed to be the root of all subsequent Greek (and thus Western) culture. He essentially argues that Greece was an Egyptian colony despite the absence of any direct, unambiguous attestation in Greek, Mycenaean, Minoan, Ugaritic, Hittite, or Egyptian sources. As far as I'm aware there is not even a native Egyptian word for 'Greece': it seems like the everything north of Crete was lumped together as '_the islands,'_ which hardly bespeaks a detailed knowledge of Greek geography. I'm not enough of an Egyptologist to be sure but the only Egyptian word for 'Greek' that I know of , _oueinin:_ appears to be another variant on the Greek Ἴωνες, the same word that shows up in Persian, Assyrian and Hebrew (as well as modern Arabic) -- it seems odd that the colonizers wouldn't have a native Egyptian word for their own possession. Archaeology in Canaan gives us quite a good idea of what an Egyptian colony actually looks like — and there’s nothing in Greek archaeology that looks like, say, [Jaffa](https://www.archaeology.org/issues/262-1707/features/5627-jaffa-egypt-canaan-colony).

To pick another random example, Bernal attempts to derive the pre-Greek toponym _[Larissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larissa)_  from an Egyptian phrase 'R-sht' which he translates as 'Gateway to the fertile land'. Not only does this ignore the fact that Greeks historically believed it to be a pre-Greek "Pelasgian" word for _fortress_  -- it also supposes that any Egyptian in their right mind would describe places in Greece as 'fertile'. Greek historically had difficulty feeding itself, and imported grain from as far away as the Crimea... and Egypt. Egypt, by contrast, was the breadbasket of the Mediterranean. It's just _barely_ conceivable that 'R-sht' might be a deliberate deception , like the medieval Norse propaganda which gave the name 'Greenland' to a barely habitable arctic waste -- but lots of things are conceivable. In general Bernal tends to makes a lot of linguistic claims which professional linguists don't buy and then to dismiss professional critics as either prisoners of an outdated paradigm or just as racist reactionaries.

There is another big, obvious problem with the narrative. There definitely is clear evidence that at least some Greeks regarded Egypt as an influence on Greek culture. From the 7th century BC onwards large Greek communities lived in Egypt as traders and as mercenaries.

So, Egypt was hardly a taboo topic in Greek literature -- which makes it much harder to argue for a large body of suppressed Egyptian knowledge that has somehow disappeared without further trace from our sources. There were at least three distinct periods of "Egyptomania" in Greek times, one during the 6th century BC (where most of his Greek literary evidence comes from), one in the early years of the Ptolemies, and another under Cleopatra. Given the willingness of the Ptolemies in particular to create Greco-Egyptian hybrids like [Serapis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serapis) out of thin air it seems odd that none of the renowned antiquaries of Alexandria ever unearthed a manuscript or edited an oral tradition which provided a clearer glimpse of the giant fact Bernal believes is hiding in plain sight.

The very familiarity of Egyptian matter in Greece also suggests the obvious possibility that some of those 'ancient' Egyptian influences were in fact much later than Bernal's proposed 18th century BC Egyptian colony . After all, the 150 years before Herodotus were marked by tight trade and political relations between Egypt and Greece; the last native Egyptian pharaohs made heavy use of Greek mercenaries; the Greek 'concession' at [Naucratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naucratis) included a broad cross-section of the Greek world. It's far from impossible that Greeks resident in Egypt -- surrounded by a wealthier and older culture -- tried to insert themselves into an Egypto-centric view of history by the same tricks Bernal uses -- casual etymologies and vague sound similarities. We know that exact process of cultural approximation went on in Italy, where both the Etruscans and Romans found ways to insert themselves into a Greek mythological context (think of the Aeneid!) -- it seems a less daring hypothesis than the wholesale suppression of a big swath of Egypto-Greek history along with a massive redating of the late Bronze Age.

It's also worth pointing out that Bernal tends to subordinate the whole complex web of cultural connections in the eastern Mediterranean to a very Egyptocentric viewpoint. Greece received influences from a lot of outside cultures. Phoenicia and Babylon tend to be relegated to walk on roles in his narrative, even though we know that many important cultural borrowings -- for example, the names of the planets and constellations, and possibly the flood myth and above all alphabetic writing -- came to Greece from the east rather than the south. Moreover he doesn't mind ignoring pretty big differences when it's convenient -- his assertion that Thebes was an "Egyptian colony" is weakened, not strengthened by the association with [Cadmus ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmus)who was a Phoenician not an Egyptian; his only real role in Bernal's argument is to be a generic 'non-European', not a particular historic figure.

While Bernal is not an Afrocentrist of the very naive 'black Cleopatra" school he seems is so heavily invested in providing a 'colored' substratum to a traditionally white subject that he jumps directly to accusations of racism and xenophobia when confronted with perfectly routine scholarly criticisms of what is, in the end, a pretty unorthodox book. In the premier volume, at least, the amount of time he spends on dissecting the motives and characters of 18th and 19th century scholars is far greater than the time he spends trying to prove his own, very audacious points and the scholarly controversy that has followed the book ever since has stuck to that unfortunate pattern.
