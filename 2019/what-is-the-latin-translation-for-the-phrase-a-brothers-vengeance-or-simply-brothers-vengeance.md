Either _ultio fratris_ or _vindicta fratris._ 

_Ultio_ emphasizes the literal act of revenge: the temple of [Mars Ultor](https://www.ancient.eu/article/617/temple-of-mars-ultor-rome/) in Rome was what Augustus Caesar built to commemorate his defeat of the men who killed Julius Caesar, his adopted father.

_Vindicta_ implies “just” revenge; it’s connected with our English “vindication”.

_Fratris_ means “brother’s” or “of a brother”.

Latin doesn’t have articles, so there’s no equivalent to “A”. And you could swap the word order without changing the meaning.
