There’s some mythological evidence that connects the royal family of Argos with Egypt, via the somewhat suspiciously named [Aegyptus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegyptus) and his [50 (!) daughters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughters_of_Danaus). However how to connect that up with an actual Egyptian Pharaoh is very much unclear.

There’s a minority view — championed by a revisionist named [Martin Bernal](https://www.quora.com/What-if-any-is-the-part-of-truth-to-Martin-Bernals-Black-Athena), which thinks this story reflects a historical colonization (the link includes details on why this is a minority view). The most common alternative is to dismiss the myths as just that —- myths. In between there are a variety of ways to think that the myths represent a real, but small and informal Egyptian influence in bronze-age Greece that would not really qualify as “colonization”.

For what it’s worth there’s no Egyptian record of overseas colonies anywhere. Crete was regarded as a tributary (though the Egyptians had a habit of treating foreigners coming to trade as “offering tribute” in their official reports). There’s no Egyptian word for “Greece” — they referred to everything north of Egypt as “Crete and the islands.”
