This is pretty common, because so much ancient source material has been lost. Before the availability of printing books were all too fragile so even if there _were_  contemporary sources they are often lost. So, it's surprisingly common for centuries to intervene between the lifetime of a historical person and the oldest surviving reference to them. In many cases our sources had access to books we've lost -- though of course, if you're a reflexive sceptic it is hard to prove that those intermediaries "really existed." 

To give a really striking example of how even pretty big events could be lost, just consider that the closest surviving source for somebody as famous as [Hannibal ](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/hannibal-3-barca/)is Polybius, who wrote about 60 years after the end of the Punic War (though technically he was a young man when Hannibal died in far-off Bithynia).  Even though the Punic War is documented in tremendous picturesque detail in Polybius and Livy the actual sources of those anecdotes are a mix of lost literary works, lost official archives, and lost oral traditions.

Here's a quick but hardly exhaustive list from Greece and Rome. Although a couple of characters on the list (particularly Croesus) had a literary 'afterlife' after their own times these are all 'real' people rather than, say, legendary heroes like Achilles. What's striking is that all of these are reasonably well known figures.
