Actually, it's a bit too early for China at the time of Socrates. Before Alexander's conquests in Persia (about a lifetime later) , the Greeks didn't have direct contact with India or China. The first recorded contacts between Greeks and China are through the Greek kindgom of [Bactria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom) in modern Afghanistan. The Bactrians explored as far east as Xinjiang and traded with the Han empire; the Chinese diplomat [Zhang Qian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Qian) is the first recorded Chinese visitor to "the west" in about 130 BC and the contacts here led to the evolution of the famous Silk Road.

On the other hand, if they _had_  made it to China it might have been quite interesting. This was a period when wandering intellectuals travelled around China, advocated for a variety of different philosophies: the [Hundred Schools of Thought.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Schools_of_Thought) They would have been quite familiar to Greeks as sophists: wandering teachers and philosophers-for-hire.

 As a proponent of limited government and mixed constitutions, Aristotle would probably not have approved of [Shang Yang, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_Yang)with whom he would have overlapped. Plato, on the other hand, had a weakness for authoritarian social reformers and schemes for rebuilding society. Much of Shang policy is reminiscent of aspects of Plato's Republic. Possibly Plato could have convinced him to implement equality of the sexes and the abolition of marriage! Plato would also have agreed with [Mozi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozi) that government is a technical craft to approached with scientific rigor -- they both, independently used the analogy of the statesman as a craftsman who must choose and know his tools.

 Aristotle would have appreciated that, and Mo's practical, logical orientation -- but neither he nor Plato would have been happy about Mo's utilitarian disregard for art and music. In general, Aristotle would have been much more comfortable with Confucian scholars --  many centuries later the Jesuits who came to China in the Renaissance found it very congenial to their Aristotelian thinking. Aristotle would certainly have enjoyed talking to the [School of Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Names) -- perhaps, in that alternate history, we'd know more about them and what they were really doing.

As for Socrates -- well, if he was able to get himself killed for being too inquisitive and too individualistic in democratic Athens, it's hard to see him flourishing in Warring States China.
