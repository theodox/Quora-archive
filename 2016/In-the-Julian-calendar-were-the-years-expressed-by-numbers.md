Not really, the standard method remained dating by consulates (so, for example, the year after Caesars’ death is _the consulate of Hirtius and Pansa_ ) . The Romans kept good records — the _[fasti consulares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasti#The_Roman_official_chronicles)_ _—_  using the consulates as reference so the sequence was not hard to follow.

In the last generation of the Republic, the historian [Marcus Terentius Varro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Terentius_Varro) began the tradition of dating events from the founding of the city of Rome, which he dated to 753 BC.

Over the next couple of centuries that notation gained ground and became more common, though it was never universally used. It was rendered a lot more popular when Philip the Arab celebrated the city’s millenial anniversary in 248. Serial dating, however, was primarily of interest to historians and antiquaries — most ordinary business was transacted using consulates or, later, the regnal years of emperors.
