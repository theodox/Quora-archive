They absolutely did, and they very self consciously tried to position themselves as heirs to the Achaemenids. However their connection was more emotional than historic: they didn’t have a very firm grasp on the actualities of Persia before Alexander.

You can see the importance the Sasanians attached to the Achaemenid heritage in the genealogical connection they invented for themselves. In the [Shahnameh ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh)— which is a late source, but which looks back to the Persian nationalism of the Sassanids — the eponymous founder of the dynasty is a shepherd who bears Achaemenid blood (predictably, in the Roman version of the same legend he’s not a royal shepherd but more of a wandering seducer). To reinforce this rather hypothetical kinship, [Ardashir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardashir_I) and [Shapur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapur_I) had themselves depicted in monumental form at the old Achaemenid necropolis of [Naqsh-e Rustam. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqsh-e_Rustam#Investiture_relief_of_Ardashir_I,_c._226-242)right below the Achaemenid tombs of Darius I, Artaxerxes I, and Darius II.

The Parthians (whom the Sasanids overthrew) had a rather ambivalent relation to the Hellenistic world: the famous story of how their victory over the Romans at [Carrhae ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carrhae)was announced to the Parthian king by a Greek actor performing Euripides’ _Bacchae_ illustrates how complicated their attitude towards the post-Alexander past could be. Parthian Persia was heavily dependent on Hellenized cities in Mesopotamia for taxes, adminstration and the arts. The Sasanids, on the other hand, were much more self-consciously Irano-centric, and the embrace of an Achaemenid identity was a way to affirm that non-Hellenic outlook against both Romans and against Parthian loyalists.

Unfortunately for the Sasanid project, Persian culture between the days of Darius and Ardashir was not heavily literate. Or, to be more precise, the Persians of those centuries tended to do their writings in other languages — in the Imperial period in Aramaic and Elamite, and in the Seleucid and Parthian eras in Greek and Syriac. So, there was little if any real understanding of the actual history of the Achaemenid period; everything before Alexander was merged into a hazy, mythologized setting with a lot of fairytale elements and few historical details; Herodotus is vastly better informed about the history and origins of the Persian empire than any Sasanid era source. The Sasanids knew instead a mythical dynasty known as the [Kayanids](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kayanian-parent), who seem to be a mix of folktales and Zoroastrian myths with a thin icing of historical detail on top.

The only really recognizable Kayanid king is [Darab](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/darab-1#ii), roughly our Darius III — except that in the version that’s come down to us he’s the half-brother of Iskander (Alexander) and the son of a Roman (!) princess named Nahib. He rules, not from Susa or Persepolis but from [Balkh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkh). When Eskandar refuses to pay him tribute, the two brothers fight. Darab seeks aid from the Indian king Porus, but help is not forthcoming and Darab is slain by treacherous ministers. On his deathbed he asks Eskandar to avenge him and to marry his daughter, Rowšanak (Roxana). This is a rather distorted but still recognizable version of the Alexander legend, but doesn’t speak highly of the Sasanid understanding of Achaemenid history.

It does appear that one area where the Sasanids did actually have direct inks to the Achaemenid past was religion. The Parthians were syncretists, who incorporated Hellenic and Buddhist ideas into their religious practice. The Sasanids were Zoroastrians (in later centuries rather intolerant ones); their rituals and religious observances resemble those of the Imperial period and at least some surviving Zoroastrian literature dates back to the Achaemenid era. However many of these texts are fairly obscure, and they don’t shed much light on anything outside the ritual or theological realm. Plus, we often interpret our Achaemenid-era evidence in light of material which was written down in the Sasanid era — it may be that we see a lot of continuity because we have no choice.
