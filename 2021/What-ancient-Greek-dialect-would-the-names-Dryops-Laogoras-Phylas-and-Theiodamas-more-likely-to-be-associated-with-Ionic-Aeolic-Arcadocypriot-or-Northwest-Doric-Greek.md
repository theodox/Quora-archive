The -as endings are typically from the western family (“Leonidas”, “Pausanias”), although you will also find them in Arcado-Cypriot (eg, “Opheltas” or “Evagoras”). It also shows up, however, in Aeolic names (“Epaminondas”, “Pelopidas”).

The historic heartland of the Dryopes was near [Mount Oeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Oeta) in central Greece — it’s also famous as [the place where Heracles died](https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/death-of-heracles.html). It’s part of a sort of “Doric salient” reaching from Aetolia and Doris east to Malis, splitting the Thessalian and Boeotian Aeolic speakers.

_Compare with the above, but don’t take too literally: it’s trivially easy to find conflicting versions of this kind of map!_ 

So, you could try to filiate it a few different ways.

Theiodamas was the father of [Hylas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylas), Heracles’ servant/squire/boyfriend. So, you could see the Dryopean names as part of the Doric stream in Greek memory given the close ties between Heracles and [later Dorian self-image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracleidae); a name passed down in a Doric tradition. Certainly in later times Dryope was regarded as a Doric conquest:

> After this, when Phylas, the king of the Dryopes, had in the eyes of men committed an act of impiety against the temple of Delphi, Heracles took the field against him in company with the inhabitants of Melis, slew the king of the Dryopes, drove the rest of them out of the land, and gave it to the people of Melis (= Doric Malis)

> Diodorus 4.37.1

Linguistically it’s usually assumed that NW Greek expanded into formerly-Aeolic areas in central Greece from the west — the “salient” of NW Greek, in this case looking a lot like a military line of march. So you could see the Dryopes as an older Aeolic population conquered by NW Greek speakers.

However, Diodorus also says (just after the quote above) that the Dryopean refugees settled in Euboea, Cyprus, and a couple of port towns (Hermione and Asine) in the southern and eastern Peloponessus. If you give that any historic weight it might represent an late-Helladic expulsion of “Mycenaean” speakers whose historic continuers would be Arcado-Cypriot speakers.

If you look for other usages, you don’t get much help. The name Laodamas gets recycled a few times: the son of Theban Eteocles, a couple of different Trojan fighters (including a son of Hector), and a Phaecian prince in the Odyssey. That would allow you to pick between Aeolic Thebes, Troy (perhaps, Lesbian Aeolic?) and Corfu (Doric in historic times, but who knows in “Homeric” times). Much later Statius has a (different) Theiodamas as a second-tier character among the Seven Against Thebes. That one is depicted as a son of [Melampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melampus), who originally came from Pylos in the western Peloponnese. If there is any real heft to that tradition, then the name could represent either a very old, pre-Dorian-expansion-if-you-believe-in-that Arcadian or Argolic Dorian.

TLDR: It’s not an easy guess and this might be a false choice: the personal names in particular follow the immemorial Greek pattern of aspirational names (“People Leader” for Laogoras, “Tribal” or ”Clansman” for Phylas, “God-compelled” for Theiodamas). So, they’d fit into any dialect except Attic/Ionic, where they’d lose the -as ending in favor of -os.

Given the location of the stories, I’d probably start with Aeolic and not try to lean too hard on my conclusions.
