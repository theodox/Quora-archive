Many construction projects end up uncovering new archaeological finds. The most famous recent examples in Rome [come from building of a new metro line](http://metrocspa.it/en/archaeology-and-monuments/archaeological-excavations/); the construction crews uncovered a [significant military encampment](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/arts/rome-subway-archaeological-marvels.html) from the second century, a [reservoir](http://www.pontuali.com/marco/en/blog/556-work-on-rome-subway-metro-digs-up-ancient-farm-and-a-large-pool.html), and a bronze-age cemetery. Back in the 1930s, transit crews also found fossilized European elphants from several thousand years before the Roman Republic came to be.

[Transit projects like this are often particularly productive because they cover very large swathes of land;](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/world/europe/rome-subway-archaeology.html) this acts as a kind of broad archaeological survey.
