In the Coptic calendar, which is the direct descendant of the ancient Egyptian calendar. There are 12 full months of thirty days each, with an additional “little month” of five days (six, in a leap year.) So, no month exactly aligns with the modern Gregorian month of August.

The Coptic month of __Epip__ (Ⲉⲡⲓⲡ, أبيب “Abib” in modern Egyptian Arabic) runs from our July 8 to our August 6, and the month of __Mesо̄ri__ (Ⲙⲉⲥⲱⲣⲓ, مسرى “Misra” in Arabic) runs from August 7 to September 5.

The [Ethiopian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_calendar) uses the same months as the Coptic one, though the names are different.

This version of the Egyptian Calendar reflects a Roman-era fix to the traditional Egyptian calendar. The Egyptians used the a year of 12 30–day months plus five extra days from at least the middle of the 25th century BC, but do not seem to have used leap years, adding a slippage relative to the son of about one day every four years. This bedevils estimates of ancient Egyptian dates, which are frequently difficult to map onto more familiar time calculations before around the 8th century BC when we can [cross-reference them against Babylonian dates, which are firmly established after 747 BC with reference to a lunar eclipses](https://www.quora.com/What-s-the-earliest-historical-event-that-we-know-the-exact-date-on-which-it-took-place-with-certainty/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=299938411&share=d5e4a8db&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer). Emperor Augustus finally imposed the extra leap-year day on the Egyptian calendar (finally following up on a failed attempt by Julius Caesar in 44 BC and similar failure by Ptolemy III in 283 BC). After 22 BC the Egyptian calendar and the Julian calendar had the same periodicity, though their months and the start of the year did not align.

Ordinary Egytpians frequently didn’t use months at all. I was quite common outside of official contexts to use thee “seasons” of the Egyptian year:

__Akhet__ (“Inundation”), the season of the Nile flood which beginning in the month of Thout (Ⲑⲱⲟⲩⲧ) on our September 11.

__Proyet__ (“Growth”), the season when the Nile flood recedes and the crops begin to grow, starting in the month of Tobi (Ⲧⲱⲃⲓ), our January 9

__Shomu__ (“Harvest”), the season of harvesting, beginning in the month of Pashons (Ⲡⲁϣⲟⲛⲥ) , our May 9.

So for a lot of people “August” would have meant “_the 84th to the 115th of Shomu_ ”. These seasons still form a part of the Coptic liturgical year.

Adding to the confusion, different Egyptian temples also maintained lunar calendars, which were much older than the solar calendar and even more likely to slip relative to the solar year.

_This example transliterates the Coptic month names closer to their modern Arabic pronunciations — above I used Coptic spellings._
