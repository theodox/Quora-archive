As far as online study groups go, you could try the forums at [Textkit](http://www.textkit.com/). There’s also the forums at [LatinDiscussion.com](http://latindiscussion.com/forum/)

In the real world there’s [CIRCULI LATINI](http://www.latinitatis.com/vita/circuli.htm), which organizes Latin discussion groups (it may take some digging to find your “local” chapter, since they are named _in Latin_  — hard core!). In the US there’s also [SALVI](http://latin.org/wordpress/), Sepetrionale Americanus Latinitatis Vivae Institutum, which organizes spoken Latin groups and has links to a few programs.

[Latinum](https://www.patreon.com/latinum/posts) (a patreon project) produces Latin audio material — not just big classics but also some learning material from the Renaissance and early modern period which is ‘beginner level’ but different enough to be interesting.
