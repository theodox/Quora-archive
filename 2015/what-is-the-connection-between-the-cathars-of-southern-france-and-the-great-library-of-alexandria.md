The connection, if any, would be pretty tenuous. As [Assaph Mehr](https://www.quora.com/profile/Assaph-Mehr) points out the importance of the Library is frequently exaggerated and it was of course long gone by the time Catharism arose.

Catharism is part of the gnostic tradition -- a complex web of beliefs with very old roots in the near east, but which spread very widely in the Greco-Roman world during the same time that saw the rise of Christianity. Like every other intellectual movement of this period (including Judaism and Christianity), Gnosticism found its strongest literary expression in the complex, multicultural milieu of Alexandria where Greek, Roman, Jewish, Egyptian and eventually Christian thought all rubbed shoulders -- Alexandria produced not only the most influential Greek philosophers of the later empire, but also many of the most important Jewish and Christian theologians and key Gnostic thinkers like [Valentinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentinus_(Gnostic)). So it's definitely true that gnostic thought was a prominent feature of the Alexandrian scene.

However, the library as an institution was socially and culturally dominated by the conservative Alexandrian aristocracy, and its collections and teaching tended to reflect their outlook. The library was not a 'multicultural' institution which tried to collect representative samples of the many streams of thought current in the city; it was an arm of the dominant Greco-Roman ruling class. It's highly unlikely that the library would have stocked gnostic texts unless they were more or less indistinguishable from other contemporary Greek philosophical works. Given that orthodox Neo-Platonism -- the dominant school of thought among Alexandrian Greeks -- tended to look down on gnostics ([Plotinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotinus) denounced gnostics as 'imbeciles' and suggested that they could always 'free themselves from the prison of material existence' by killing themselves) it's highly unlikely that the Library actively collected or curated their works.

The origins of Catharism aren't well understood, but the movement seems to be closely related to the [Bogomils ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogomilism)of the Balkans, who were themselves influenced by the [Paulicians](http://www.britannica.com/topic/Paulicians), who originated in Armenia and probably reflect the regional history of dualism in that region going back to Manichaeism and ultimately to Zoroastrianism. Paulicians, Bogomils and Cathars all displayed their gnosticism in a Christian garb, so even if they had access to Neo-platonic or proto-gnostic works in Greek these were unlikely to be of critical importance in their outlook.
