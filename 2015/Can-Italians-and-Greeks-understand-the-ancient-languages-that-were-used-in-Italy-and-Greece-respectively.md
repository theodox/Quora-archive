Modern Greek shares a lot of vocabulary with ancient Greek -- in part because Greek nationalists in the 19th and 20th centuries made a conscious effort to 'reform' modern Greek to be 'purer'. There are grammatical differences and very different idioms but by rough analogy, New Testament era Greek is about as legible to a modern Greek as Malory's _Morte D'Arthur_  is to somebody in modern English. 



> Thou arte full yong and tendyr of age sayd Arthur for to take so hyghe an ordre on the. Sir ſaid gryflet I byſeche yow make me knygt. Syr said Merlyn it were grete pyte to lese Gryflet,for he wille be a passynge good man whanne he is of age abydynge with yow the terme of his lyf.



 Older stuff, particularly Homer, is much more different : more like:



> þis boc is dan Michelis of Northgate / ywrite an englis of his oȝene hand. þet hatte: Ayenbyte of inwyt.

> _This book is [the work of] don Michael of Northgate, written in English in his own hand, that's called: Remorse of Conscience._ 



Modern Italian is descended from Latin, and shares considerable vocabulary, but it has abandoned many grammatical forms. In particular, Italian doesn't use [noun declensions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declension) the way Latin did , it uses word order and pronouns much like English does. This means that modern Italians will recognize many word roots in Latin, but they will have a hard time with anything beyond the simplest statements, since the basic grammatical roles of the words won't be clear ( [Steve Theodore's answer to Did the Romans of antiquity speak with adjectives?](https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Romans-of-antiquity-speak-with-adjectives/answer/Steve-Theodore) has a great example from Caesar, where he subject, verb and object are separated by several dozen words. Without the grammar, the nouns and verbs are just word salad) 

The closest descendant of Latin among modern languages is often said to be Romanian. Even though Romanian uses more Slavic vocabulary and sounds than Italian, it retains the nominal declensions (interesting, it has lost some more complex verb tenses instead: perhaps a Romanian and an Italian working together could puzzle out written Latin.
