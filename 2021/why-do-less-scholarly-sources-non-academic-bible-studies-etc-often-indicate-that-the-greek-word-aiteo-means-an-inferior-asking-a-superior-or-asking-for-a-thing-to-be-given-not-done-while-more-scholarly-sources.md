# Why do less scholarly sources (non-academic Bible studies, etc) often indicate that the Greek word aiteo means “an inferior asking a superior” or “asking for a thing to be given, not done while more scholarly sources simply define it as “asking?”

If you look up the[ LSJ entry](https://lsj.gr/wiki/%CE%B1%E1%BC%B0%CF%84%CE%AD%CF%89) you’ll note that several of the examples are from the Odyssey where it’s used explicitly for begging:

> 18.48:

> αἰεὶ αὖθ᾽ ἡμῖν μεταδαίσεται, οὐδέ τιν᾽ἄλλον 
πτωχὸν ἔσω μίσγεσθαι ἐάσομεν __αἰτήσοντα__ .

> he shall always feast with us, nor will we suffer any other 
beggar to join our company and beg of us

> 17.365
βῆ δ᾽ ἴμεν __αἰτήσων__ ἐνδέξια φῶτα ἕκαστον,
πάντοσε χεῖρ᾽ ὀρέγων, ὡς εἰ πτωχὸς πάλαι εἴη.

> So he set out to beg of every man, beginning on the right, stretching out his hand on every side, as though he had been long a beggar.

However like English “beg” it can shade over into asking with emphasis (“I beg your pardon”, “I beg you to reconsider”) and the LSJ entry above includes examples of that as well. It’s worth pointing out that there’s almost a millennium between the Greek of Homer and the Greek of the New Testament — time enough for the word to acquire multiple shades of meaning.

Probably the most important distinction here is the one between asking for something (αἰτέω) and inquiring about something (ἐρωτάω). Asking for things does often imply a dependent position.
