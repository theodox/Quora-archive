It depends on when you’re asking about. In general Sparta was not a significant naval power. However there was one decade during which the Spartans had — temporarily — the most powerful fleet in Greece.

The Peloponnessian war(s) lasted for an entire generation, from 431 to 404 BC. For most of that time, the Spartan navy was negligible at best: the Spartans generally ceded the sea to the Athenians, while the Athenians pretty much refused to face the Spartan army on land. As late as 413, the Spartan fleet was only a couple of dozen vessels while the Athenians fielded fleets as large as four hundred.

In the last decade of the war, however, the Spartans made an alliance with Persia. The Persians funded the creation and training of a new, larger fleet. The Persian gold paid for ships but more importantly it paid for rowers — no Spartan warrior would demean himself by pulling on an oar, but slave oarsmen had repeatedly proven inferior in motivation and skill to the free citizens who manned the Athenian fleet.

With the Great King’s money, the Spartans could recruit mercenary rowers from all over the eastern Mediterranean, particularly from the Greek cities in Persian territory and from Phoenicia. Not a few of them were hired away, directly or indirectly from the Athenians themselves:

> At a banquet which Cyrus gave him as he was about to depart, the prince begged him not to reject the tokens of his friendliness, but to ask plainly for whatever he desired, since nothing whatsoever would be refused him. "Since, then," said Lysander in reply, "thou art so very kind, I beg and entreat thee, Cyrus, to add an obol to the pay of my sailors, that they may get four obols instead of three." Cyrus, accordingly, delighted with his public spirit, gave him ten thousand darics, out of which he added the obol to the pay of his seamen, and, by the renown thus won, soon emptied the ships of his enemies. For most of their seamen came over to those who offered higher pay, and those who remained were listless and mutinous, and gave daily trouble to their officers.

Even so, it took quite some time to build the fleet up. The first success, at [Notium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Notium) in 406, was due mostly to Athenian overconfidence — but it was soon reversed at [Arginusae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Arginusae) by clever Athenian tactics. However the Athenians had failed to realize that the situation was slipping out of their grasp, and they again failed to take the Spartans seriously: the next year, at [Aegospotami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aegospotami), the Spartans caught the Athenian fleet unguarded on the beach and destroyed it, sealing the doom of the Athenian’s maritime empire.

The Spartan navy didn’t last long. For several years after the war, the Spartans were embroiled in a messy, multi-way conflict inside the Persian empire. The Spartan fleet supported the campaigns of [Agesilaus II ](http://www.livius.org/articles/person/agesilaus-ii/)in Asia but the Persians settled their differences and built a new fleet of their own — commanded by [Conon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conon), the Athenian admiral who had lost at Aegospotami — and chased the Spartans from the sea in 394.

After that the Spartans tended to focus on their traditional land-lubbing ways. So, from say 405 to 395 they were the major naval power in Greece. Before or after that, however, they were a third-rate naval power.
