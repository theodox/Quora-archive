Most ancient historians are specialists in fairly narrow windows of time and space — sure, you may have to teach a survey course on “Greece and Rome” or “Mesopotamian civilization” but you probably focus your scholarly output on something much narrower and more specialized. And — if you’re a typical academic — you almost certainly pin your sense of self worth and your professional cred on climbing to the top of the pecking order in your chosen specialty, not on grander narratives and more sweeping vistas. That stuff is for the despised “popularizers.”

So, the answer will really depend on who you ask. Here’s a few that I’m sure would be popular choices — but I suspect we’re talking a 6% vote-winner in a field of 2’s and 3’s. But the fact is any substantially complete text would spawn a generation of scholarship: in a field where there are over 800 known Greek historians but fewer than a dozen substantially complete texts, _anything_ would send historians over the moon. And let’s not forget the cultural historians and literary historians who want to see women’s writing, popular literature, and the plays or poems we only hear of in disparaging contrast to the “classics” that survived for us. Hell, even an intact basket of shopping lists or a tax registry would keep a generation of historians busy.

So — to keep the list to a readable minimum I’ll stick with narrative histories for areas where we have big gaps. That’s not a value judgement, just an effort to keep this under 10,000 words.

__Greeks__ 

Perhaps the most poignant (or at least the showiest) losses are the known, but vanished first-hand histories of Alexander the Great: his official historian __[Callisthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callisthenes)__ __,__ his admiral __[Nearchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearchus)__ __,__ his engineer __[Aristobulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristobulus_of_Cassandreia)__ __,__ and his general/friend/maybe-half-brother __[Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter)__  all wrote first-hand accounts of Alexander’s career and campaigns. About a generation later __[Cleitarchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleitarchus)__ , wrote a book that seems to have been mostly based on the stories (sometimes, perhaps, a bit embroidered) of retired Macedonian campaigners.

All the later accounts draw on these (which seem to have included, or at least quoted from, Alexander’s letters and court diaries) but none of these survives: astonishingly enough the oldest surviving continuous treatment of Alexander’s career comes from Diodorus Siculus, almost three centuries after Alexander’s time.* The crimes which any historian of Alexander would commit to get a complete text of one of these are uncountable.

Right behind these is the history of __[Hieronymus of Cardia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_of_Cardia)__ __,__ who not only chronicled Alexander but also the tumultuous wars of his successors all the way down to Pyrrhus of Epirus — Hieronymus lived to be 104, and was known as a careful and methodical researcher. To top it off, Hieronymus is believed to have made an effort to get to know the then-obscure Romans (if only as bit players in his account of Pyrrhus’ invasion of Italy).

__Romans__ 

Speaking of those Romans:

__[Fabius Pictor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Fabius_Pictor)__  wrote the earliest known native history of Rome (albeit, in Greek). He was a young boy when Pyrrhus invaded Italy, and lived to write a contemporary history of first and second Punic Wars. Lots of historians would kill for a view of early Rome that harked back to Rome’s days as a middling territorial state rather than a great power.

Contrarily, __[Sosylus of Lacedaemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosylus_of_Lacedaemon)__  was Hannibal’s Greek tutor, and he wrote a contemporary history of Hannibal’s career in Greek which was published to the Greek world at large. It would be fascinating to see the history of such a well known period as the other side wished it to be seen.

The Sicilian historian __[Timaeus of Tauromenion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(historian))__  has a poor reputation, largely because he was often criticized on both stylistic and historiographic grounds by the hugely influential (and well preserved) Polybius. Nonetheless he’s the first Greek author to recognize the growing importance of Rome, and his work will naturally have covered large swathes of Carthaginian history of which we are sadly ignorant.

On a less readable level, it would be great if somebody found a substantial (and ideally, well dated) copy of the __[Annales Maximi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annalists)__ , the official annual journal of the college of pontifexes in Rome. While the survivng fragments make it clear that this would not be a juicy read (it’s a mix of official news and odd portents — _M. Claudius Marcellus elected aedile. Cow born with two heads in Praeneste. Volscians defeated_  ) but it would provide a tremendous benefit for students of the murky chronology and patriotically embellished first two centuries of the Republic).

And of course there are the __[lost books of Livy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_Urbe_Condita_Libri#:~:text=The%20last%20event%20covered%20by,(books%2021%2D45).)__ ____ (modern editions only contain about a quarter of his whole work) and the missing bits of __[Tacitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_(Tacitus)#:~:text=Tacitus%20wrote%20the%20Annals%20in,death%20of%20Domitian%20in%2096.)__ ____ (about half of the 30 attested books).

__Everybody else__ 

It’s comparatively easy to enumerate lost works of Greek and Latin historiography, since many of them are alluded to in surviving works. It’s much harder to know where to even begin. For people writing in other languages, or for smaller communities which generated less mention in the mainstream sources, the picture is much bleaker. This is particularly when sticking with narrative histories: many sophisticated cultures (most strikingly, Egypt) had literacy and good records but never developed the habit of historical narratives that extended past king-lists and genealogies. The one known exception in Egypt is __[Manetho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho)__ __,__ a Ptolemaic-era Egyptian priest who made a serious effort to organize a native Egyptian history that could be compared with Greek models. Manetho’s work survives only in fragments (albeit, often very extensive ones) but much of its narrative detail has been lost.

Our grasp of pre-Roman Italy is based almost entirely on Roman sources. It would be wonderful to have a long-form history from any non-Roman perspective — though if there ever were any, they leave no trace in our records. We do know that the Roman emperor Claudius, who fancied himself a scholar, wrote a __history of the Etruscans__  which would throw a huge amount of light on that enigmatic people.

We do have traces of the subaltern literatures of the Greek and Roman worlds empire: the most famous examples are Jewish writers like Philo and Josephus, but it’s clear there were others. The Babylonian __[Berossus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berossus)__ __,__ the Phoenician __[Philo of Byblus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Bybloshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byblos)__ ____ are both known only by quotations in later writers; many historians of the Near East would happily sacrifice an undergraduate to Moloch to get their hands on complete originals.



The truly sad bit is, this list is only based on things we know we could have had. There are literally hundreds of texts whose existence we know of only through a chance allusion or single quotation. The survival rate for Greek and Roman era texts is probably around 3%. For every author or work listed here there are probably 30 equally fascinating alternatives… we just don’t know what they were.

___[Die Fragmente der Griechischen Historiker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmente_der_griechischen_Historiker)___ _collects all of the known quotes or paraphrases of lost Greek historians. On average, every page or two of this set equates to a complete lost work. There are 1400 known names in the published version — with seven or eight more volumes still planned._
