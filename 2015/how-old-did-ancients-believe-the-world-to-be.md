There's no agreement among ancient sources, between or usually even within cultures. But here's a few data points.

The [Sumerian King List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_King_List#Antediluvian_rulers) names a lot of kings before we run into the historically verifiable [Enmebaragesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enmebaragesi) around 2500 BC: it has about 15,000 years worth of kings before him, going back to "the time of the flood" and then about 200,000 years of antediluvian kings (mostly reigning for 20,000 years a so apiece!) dating back to "when the kingship descended from heaven". Most later Mesopotamian cultures knew of and referred back to the Sumerian version.

Egyptian records go back at least as far as [Menes](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Menes), who was dated in Egyptian tradition to around what we would call 2,900 BC. [Manetho's History of Egypt](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/History_of_Egypt/1*.html), written under the Ptolemies, adds before Menes 14,900 years of rule by the gods, and 11,000 years (more or less) of rule by "Demigods, and Spirits of the Dead" (this may not be as off as it sounds: archaeologists have uncovered a previously unknown proto-Pharoah apparently named [Ka ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka_(pharaoh))or "soul").

Hesiod's [Theogony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theogony) offered a cosmology in which all existence begins with _χάος_  (our "Chaos", literally, a "void") Chaos gave birth to [Nyx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyx) (night) and [Erebus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erebus) (Darkness), and the more familiar Titans and personifications including Gaia. Hesiod's sources seem to have some near-eastern elements, some scholars think that this story is connected with the Mesopotamian story of [Tiamat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiamat), and maybe with the Biblical version.

The Greeks had a set of flood myths too; Plato refers to the earliest of them, the [Ogygian deluge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_flood_myths), as being 9,000 years before his own time.

However in the common sources cosmic origin isn't attached to any kind of historical date . That however was preceded by the mythological [Age of Cronus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronus), more familiar as the 'Golden Age' when men, gods and nature lived in harmony -- I'm not familiar with any source that gave it a duration in years, it was the Ancient Greek equivalent "In the beginning..."

The Greek historical sense, by contrast, was very compressed: the Greeks were aware that they were relative newcomers in the Mediterranean world, and they were uncomfortable with the fact that their own traditions went back only a few dozen generations while many nations around them seemed immemorial. Herodotus tells how a Greek traveler in Egypt boasted of being only 16 generations removed from an a god -- and who was taken by the Egyptian priests to a hall with the statues of 345 generations of priests, all mortal. (He incidentally attributes to the Egyptians the statement that the final form of the Egyptian pantheon was about 17,000 years before his time). Herodotus also speculated that Egypt had originally been much smaller, and had filled out its current shape via silt deposits -- he guessed that the Nile, if diverted into the Red Sea, would fill it out into similar configuration in 20,000 years.

Aristotle believed that the earth was eternal, without beginning or end. In the heyday of the medieval Aristotelian, many young students in both Arab and European schools had their faith shaken by this contradiction between science and revelation. Aristotle's opinion is probably derived from the [Pre-Socratic philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy), who advanced a number of contradictory theories about the ultimate origin and nature of mature (including, ultimately, the 'atomic' theory of [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus)). Since most of these philosophers saw the world as a ceaseless combination and re-combination of basic elements the overall picture of the world was of a steady state, like the sea which changes all the time yet remains the sea.

The [Eleatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleatics) took this idea to the extreme, arguing for the complete unity of all things (and therefore that time and change are illusions: several famous [phiulosophical paradoxes](http://www.iep.utm.edu/zeno-par/), such as [Zeno’s Paradox of the Tortoise and Achilles](http://platonicrealms.com/encyclopedia/zenos-paradox-of-the-tortoise-and-achilles) were created to bolster the argument that change-over-time is an illusion.
