# Did the Ancient Egyptians use their own alphabet for writing Coptic texts? If so, why did they also use Greek letters?

“Coptic” is just the final form of the ancient Egyptian language, written using a version of the Greek alphabet padded out with a few extra characters adapted from older Egyptian scripts for uniquely Egyptian sounds.

Greek was the language of governance and law in Egypt for almost a thousand years (from Alexander in the fourth century BC to the Arab conquest in the sixth century of our era) but throughout that period Egyptians still spoke and wrote their own language as well. The adoption of the Greek alphabet for writing Egyptian was a matter of convenience for Egyptians themselves.

When Alexander arrived in Egypt, ordinary Egyptians wrote in what we call the [Demotic script](https://www.arce.org/resource/demotic-history-development-and-techniques-ancient-egypts-popular-script) (demotic is Greek for “popular” or “everyday”.)

Demotic is descended from hieroglyphics via an intermediate form known as [Hieratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieratic). Hieratic can be seen as the adaptation of hieroglyphics for easier writing with pen on papyrus; the signs lose most of their distinctive pictorial shapes but the complex mix of syllabic, consonantal and ideographic writing which makes hieroglyphics so difficult to learn remains.

Demotic emerged around the end of the New Kingdom as a simplification of Hieratic — it still retained conceptual signs but it was mostly a consonantal abjad; that is, it recorded mostly consonants and only had limited support for vowels. By the Roman era, a third to half of all the characters in a given Demotic text were “alphabetic”. However, like hieroglyphs and hieratic Demotic retained some extra symbols for important concepts or grammatical hinting. Japanese writing — where syllabic spellings co-exist with ideographic kanji — offers a rough analogy for the complexity of Demotic (though there were fewer ideographs in Demotic than in Japanese).

The Ptolemies inherited the Egyptian-language bureaucracy and law courts of their Persian and Egyptian predecessors. For the first three centuries or so of Greek rule Demotic was a secondary script for legal and government purposes — although the famous Rosetta Stone contained Greek and Hieroglyphic versions of the same royal proclamation, most of the Egyptians who saw it would have read the Demotic version.

It was really the Roman conquest of Egypt that encouraged the switch from Demotic to Coptic — although Demotic remained common for domestic consumption, it fell out of use for legal purposes during the first two centuries of our era: the Romans preferred a single, unified legal system instead of the bilingual and bi-procedural system of the Ptolemaic era. This in turn pushed many Egyptians to become bilingual in Egyptian and Greek for practical reasons.

The Coptic script emerged from the combination of Greek handwriting styles of the second and third centuries with a couple of characters borrowed from Demotic for uniquely Egyptian sounds.

The adoption of Greek letter forms and the final abandonment of all the non-alphabetic characters in Demotic made for an easier script, particularly for the large percentage of Egyptians who were bilingual in Egyptian and Greek. The decline of the old Egyptian temples — which lost their prestige and a lot of their funding in the Roman era — made Demotic less attractive as a script since so many of its conventions were ultimately based in hieroglyphics and Hieratic. Most Coptic dialects ended up with only 31 characters to learn, instead of the many scores needed for Demotic.

The switchover was not immediate — Demotic (and Hieratic) lingered into the fourth century or so. However popular literacy increasingly switched to Coptic during the early Roman era. During the transition old habits faded out slowly: a lot of early Coptic manuscripts don’t use vowels, instead adding overscores to remind the reader where a vowel would go — a holdover from consonantal Demotic combined with a common Greek scribal shorthand for abbreviations.
