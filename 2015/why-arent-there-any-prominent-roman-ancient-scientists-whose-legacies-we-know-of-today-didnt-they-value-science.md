# Why aren't there any prominent Roman (ancient) scientists whose legacies we know of today? Didn't they value science?

There was a lot of "science" along the lines pursued by Galen and Pliny, as the other answers rightly note: observation, cataloguing, and informed speculation. Medicine, biology, astronomy and geography were all studied, but of course the vast majority of this material was lost. The modern empirical method, however, was not part of the literary tradition of what the Romans and Greeks called "natural philosophy." 

There was, of course, a lot of technical innovation which -- we have to guess, but it seems safe to assume -- was pursued along empirical lines: more like Thomas Edison's experimental approach to innovation, testing and improving based on results but without a connection to a formal "scientific" study or a literary expression. There are some exceptions - [Archimedes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes) managed to combine both theory and application, as the Romans found out [the hard way](http://www.unmuseum.org/burning_mirror.htm) - but overall technology in the ancient world existed in isolation from 'science'.

Before the Renaissance, the practical concerns of technologists and the theoretical insights of the natural philosophers didn't overlap as much as they do today. Philosophy, natural or un-, was primarily an elite occupation, pursued by well-educated members of the leisure class, whereas business was not a high status occupation (to be "in trade" was as dishonorable for a Roman senator as it would be for a Jane Austen character). Getting your hands dirty as an engineer, a metallurgist, a shipwright or anything else similarly practical was for the middle classes (Architecture was something of an exception -- perhaps because it involved ordering huge numbers of people around, it was an acceptable pastime). 

Since there was no way of protecting what we'd call "intellectual property", technology was rarely written down (architecture, again, is the main exception). Important techniques were deliberately kept secret, for commercial advantage, rather than being publicized. So, our written sources lean very heavily towards the observational and metaphysical sides of science, since those were (a) non commercial and (b) acceptable ways for a gentleman to make a name for himself as an author. It's not until the Renaissance that the social barriers between "science" and "technology" are lowered enough that practical and technological concerns really enter the written record.
