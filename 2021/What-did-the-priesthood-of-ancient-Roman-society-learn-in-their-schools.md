Rome didn’t have anything like theological seminaries: priesthoods were, for the most part, elected or appointed officers who organized public ceremonies and festivals. Rather than delivering sermons and expounding theological ideas, Roman priests performed carefully prescribed roles in very ancient ceremonies whose origins and meanings were at best obscure.

The limits on their conduct were essentially magical rather than moral: they were full of ancient ritual proscriptions which were carefully observed but usually completely obscure (for example the Greek writer Plutarch, [trying to explain Roman rites to his Greek audience,](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/home.html) is often forced to guess about the nature of contemporary Roman observances) . Here are a just some of the key ritual obligations of the [Flamen Dialis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamen_Dialis), the nominal “high priest of Jupiter”

He was forbidden to sleep out of his own bed for three nights in a row.

He could not touch a horse or touch iron

[He could not touch flour or yeast](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/E.html#109)

He was could not touch a dog,[ a she-goat](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/E.html#111), ivy, beans, or [uncooked meat](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/E.html#110).

He had to wear wear the _apex_ , a point-tipped hat, and a _laena_ , a heavy wool cloak. He could not appear in public without the apex.

[He could not swear an oath](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/B.html#44)

He was not allowed to wear a ring with gems

He could not have knots in any part of his attire

He could not touch a dead body or enter a cemetery

[He could not wash in open air](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/B.html#40)

It was unlawful to place a box containing sacrificial cakes in contact with the bedstead.

He was not allowed to be present of a table without food, so that he never appeared wanting

[He was not allowed to pass under an ivy arbor](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/E.html#112)

His ritual powers included the right to free a person in chains, precedence at public banquets, and the right to prevent the punishment of a prisoner for one day.

This kind of role was not pastoral like that of a modern clergy person, nor was it an interpretive role like that of a rabbi or an imam. As such it required no particular training. It is worth noting that Romans were famously scrupulous about the precise nature of their rituals (even the Greeks, no slouches when it came to ritualism, thought the Romans were hyper-vigilant about such things).

You might analogize the culture surrounding the Roman priesthood to the very precise set of behaviors that surrounds the British Royal family or the Pope in official settings. We have to assume (there’s not a lot of good evidence) that the institutional norms were actually managed by collective memory more than by formal education: given the hereditary restriction on eligibility it was possible to find yourself, like Julius Caesar did, appointed to one of these highly ritualized positions at age 13.
