It’s more mixed than you might think from what you read online. The stereotypes tend to derive from a less mature period in the industry (which, after all, is only about 30 years old) and the modern reality isn’t as bad as it used to be. There is definitely a pretty big spectrum among developers, from the sane to the classic sweatshop. Not surprisingly its the worst cases that get all the negative attention — and some of them are pretty bad.

There are a number of variables at play that don’t usually make it into the discussions: crunch comes in a lot of flavors. For example coders are usually the worst hit, because typically their work isn’t always easy to reapportion: you can usually cut content if things are running late , but if the code isn’t coming together there’s no easy way out. QA crunch can be particularly hard because the hunt for a particularly elusive bug is a numbers game: a 1-in-10,000 occurrence is hard to find without a few thousand tries. On the other hand some disciplines are less affected; some branches of design, for example, but also infrastructure people like ops teams and IT folks.

The kind of game also makes a big difference. Games with big technical risks are crunch-prone; to a lesser degree, so are games with very high production values. Big budgets tend to come with big pressures. On the other hand there are a lot of niches that aren’t particularly crunchy. There are a lot of studios working on DLC, sequels, expansions and whatnot that don’t create a lot of drama. Mobile and casual titles have a different kind of stress: the production cycles aren’t usually as crunchy because they are shorter and have less randomness. These studios don’t usually have long crunches — but they do have to manage to crank out titles on a fairly regular basis, which is stressful in a different way. And of course the explosion of indie studios has brought a lot of people into the industry in much smaller, less formal kinds of arrangements. These are all over the map in terms of working conditions, professionalism, and good planning.

In general, the most studios nowadays recognize that crunching is a failure: it reflects the fact that the game was improperly scheduled or badly designed. Failures do happen more often than we’d like: about 2/3 of developers report that their jobs involve _some_  crunch. Most stable studios have stopped relying on it for more than short bursts, however, because it’s economically inefficient. It’s pretty widely recognized that the long term recovery costs (in terms of deferred maintenance, in all the bugs created by 3am coding, and in all the personnel churn that results from crunching) outweigh any money the studios might save on wages. Most studios would prefer not to crunch, though few of us can completely avoid it.

That said, there definitely are studios that still practice old-style burnout development with the late nights, cheap pizza, and bedrolls under the desk.

These crunch studios really come in two flavors: There’s the “good” kind, the one that thrives on passion — typically it’s young studios where the devs have (or at least, hope they have) a direct stake in the success of the title. Usually these studios skew young — which adds inexperience to passion as a driver of hours (but — as per the original question — these are studios that tend not to have a lot of parents on staff).

There’s also the bad kind: studios that deliberately over-schedule their people in order to squeeze more work out of smaller workforce. These are, thankfully, rarer than they used to be but they still exist. Most of the holdouts are bottom feeders with all sorts of shady practices.

The really sad cases are studios where a youthful crunch culture has set in stone and become institutionalized: what used to be passion turns into obligation. That’s the worst kind of crunch culture because it’s a ghastly parody of the romance and excitement that brings a lot of people into the business. Veterans can usually spot this but a lot of youngsters buy into the myths without looking too critically. The lucky ones learn a lot on the job and move on to a saner place, but a lot of people just burn out and leave the industry.

So I think the stereotype is a lot less accurate than it was in the days of [EA Spouse](http://ea-spouse.livejournal.com/274.html), but quality of life issues are still an ongoing problem. It’s definitely hurt our ability to retain people. It certainly contributes to our ongoing issues with gender imbalance. But most devs deal with it: Hours and working conditions tend to come in around the middle of the pack when you survey devs about their concerns — well behind both professional opportunities and salary. On the other hand the same surveys tend to suggest that burnout is the number one reason (cited about 40% of the time) for people leaving the industry.

All that said: overwork _does_  hurt families. I personally know of one title that was directly implicated in more than half a dozen divorces. The bad cases are less common than they used to be — but no game is worth that kind of sacrifice.
