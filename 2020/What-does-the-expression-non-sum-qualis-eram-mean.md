“I’m not what I used to be”. You could also say “I am not what I was” — but _eram_  typically implies “I was this way in the past for a stretch of time”. _Qualis_ is literally “what” but it has the extra connotation of “the quality of something which makes it itself” — our “quality” is Latin _qualitas_ , a word invented to cover the philosophical idea of we’d probably call “essence.”
