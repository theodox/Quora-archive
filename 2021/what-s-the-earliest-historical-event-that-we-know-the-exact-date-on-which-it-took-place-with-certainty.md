It really depends what you mean by certain.

Ancient calendars were far from uniform or reliable. Every society — nearly every city — had its own, and they were frequently overseen by politicians or priests rather than astronomers. It took millennia for anything like really reliable, easily translatable dating to become the norm.

So, if you want to go hunting for certainty in early dates you need to look at something that does not depend on human whims. The favorite tool of frustrated chronographers everywhere, therefore, is the __solar eclipse__  which can be dated with a great deal of precision for any particular place. That’s why, for example, Greek historians love [The Battle Of the Eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Eclipse), which firmly puts the Lydians and the Persians on the field on May 28, 585 BC and the [Eclipse of Nicias](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kionasmith/2019/08/27/how-a-lunar-eclipse-defeated-a-greek-army/?sh=67c000209473) (August 28, 413 BC) which led to the Athenian defeat in Syracuse and ultimately the Spartan victory in the Peloponnesian war).

So, if you really, really, _really_ mean “certain” you have to find an astronomical event. We have lots of smart, reasonable _guesses_  about dates going well back into the third millennium BC. Just because they are hypothetical does not mean they aren’t fiendishly clever — yet, guesses they remain. For the remainder of this answer I’m going to stick with dates that can be unambiguously anchored to astronomical events: not that the other dates you might get if you look up some Egyptian or Mesopotamian date are “wrong”, only that they are always best-guess reconstructions unless they are tied to a firm stellar synchronism.

_The Ugarit eclipse tablet, from_ _[J. F. A. Sawyer and F. R. Stephenson](https://www.jstor.org/stable/614517?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A5791dbb19a9a88f6481808398da21b8f&seq=9#page_scan_tab_contents)_ 

The oldest oldest _precisely_ datable event is probably a solar eclipse which occurred at __1:20 pm, March 5, 1223 BC__  in Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra, Syria).

> [Front] Six. New moon, month of _ḫiyaru._ The sun went down [in the day] with _Ršp_ [=Mars] in attendance.

> [Back] Two livers were examined. Danger!

You want precision? There’s precision.

Except, alas, that there are two rival candidates for for the Ugarit eclipse. The other two candidates are __January 21, 1192 BC__  and __May 3, 1375.__ All three are astronomically valid — though 1192 is a partial eclipse, and 1375 does not really account for Mars. I’ve used the 1223 date because I buy the argument about how to interpret that enigmatic “Six” (as hour 6 of an Egyptian-style 10-hour day, so, around 1 PM) That lines up with the precise timing for the Ugarit eclipse.

I’ll add in passing that the 1192 date has a different, and very compelling story to tell: One scholar notes that the tablet was not found in the palace library or a temple archive. Was it dropped by a courier on the way to the palace by a nervous acolyte? We know from radiocarbon dates that Ugarit was destroyed very close to 1190: what if the eclipse in fact coincided with the climatic attack on the city? If so it would fix the date for this notable event (which has a spiderweb of connections to other sources in Egypt, Cyprus, and Syria) to exactly January 21, 1192 BC.

The main reason not to use that date? It’s just _too good._ That’s not a scientific opinion, however, just _weltschmerz._ In any event, the fact that we can jump back and forth by almost two centuries even when we do have such a great piece of evidence tells you everything you need to know about the precision problem in ancient dates.

For more on the dating of the Ugarit Eclipse:







Obviously, if you truly crave certitude, we have to move forward a bit further in time.

If you really want to a solid date which is reliably tied to an astronomical source you have to fast forward about 400 years. The Chinese __[Spring and Autumn Annals](http://spring%20and%20autumn%20annals/)__  record a solar eclipse of __July 17, 709 BC.__ The Annals anchor subsequent Chines chronology quite well — a boon for Chinese historians, even though the annals are often pretty cryptic otherwise. You can rely on the annals back to 722.

However with little extra work, we can work back a bit farther with a precision of about half a year, thanks to the vainglory of [Nabonassar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabonassar), king of Babylon. Nabonassar sponsored a fairly scientific reorganization of the Babylonian calendar. He humbly chose to initiate it with his own accession to the throne on __February 27, 747 BC,__ 21 days after a lunar eclipse. The next several centuries of Mesopotamian astronomical records were all continuous with this date (well into Roman times: they formed the basis of the [Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest) of Egypto-Roman astronomer [Claudius Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy)) providing a reliable bridge between human and celestial events

_The first line of this tablet records the lunar eclipse of Febuary 6, 747 BC, reproduced from Herman Hunger,_ _[Astronomical Diaries and Related Texts from Babylonia](https://www.caeno.org/pdf/Hunger_LBAT%201413%20List%20translation%20hand%20copy.pdf)_ 

Luckily for us, the Babylonian observations exist in a web of other records with cross-links which all us to walk back much further with a high degree of reliability. [Assyrian civil records](https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/limmu/limmu-list-858-699-bce/#:~:text=The%20Limmu%20List%2C%20which%20is,reconstruct%20the%20chronology%20of%20Mesopotamia.) have their own astronomical synchronism on __June 15, 763,__ and they can be cross-checked with the Babylonian ones. They seem to be reliable back at least to the reign of [Shalmaneser III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalmaneser_III) in 859 BC. So, for example, we can be pretty sure that an Assyrian army campaigned in Cilicia in the Assyrian year corresponding to our late 839 and early 838. Assyrian lists of kings appear to be pretty solid back even farther, to [Ashur-dan I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashur-dan_I) (1178–1133 BC) — any event dated relative to an Assyrian king’s reign down to 1178 is probably good to +/- 6 months.

That said, all ancient chronology gets increasingly shaky on the far side of the Bronze Age Collapse (somewhere around the turn of the 12th century BC) By the time you get back to Hammurabi — usually cited as 1792–1750 BC — the difference between the high and low estimates is quite large: the low estimate for Hammurabi is 1704 BC; the high estimate is 1930 BC! Most people use the so-called “middle chronology” dates, and archaeological evidence is slowly accumulating that the middle chronology is more or less correct. Nonetheless the pros will tell you that anything before around 1200 BC is a something of a gamble.

If you’re wondering about Egypt — the same basic rule applies. The solid fixes are still dependent on Nabonassar and the stars; in fact they even start a little later: rock-solid dates begin with the [Assyrian capture of Thebes in 663](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Thebes), since it’s dated against the Babylonian records. Before that there’s a wealth of information but it’s incomplete and sometimes contradictory. For most of the second millennium BC the margin of error is around 10–20 years; by the time you get back to the third millennium it’s as much as 200 years.

Which brings us back to Ugarit: assuming we can trust that 1223 date, it’s as far back as you can go without worrying about ancient scribal errors, oral traditions, or politically revised records. Otherwise you could pick the Chinese eclipse of 709, the accession of Nabonassar in 747, or you can follow the Assyrians back to 1173 one year at a time.

There are actually few other candidates for “earliest eclipse” ([this is a good collection](https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhistory/SEhistory.html)) but they all involve higher degrees of conjecture than the ones I’ve used here. The coolest one, by far, is that the prophecy of Theoclimenus in the _Odyssey_ reflects a solar eclipse. Bonus points — this theory goes back to Plutarch, 2000 years ago!

If true, [this allows us to date Odysseus’ decimation of the suitors to April 16, 1178 BC.](https://www.pnas.org/content/105/26/8823) It works well with traditional dates for the Trojan war. Alas, it’s probably another example of the too-good-to-be-true genre.
