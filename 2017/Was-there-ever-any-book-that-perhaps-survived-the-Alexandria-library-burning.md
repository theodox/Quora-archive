We know very little about the actual fate of the Library — we don’t even have a complete consensus on when it met its demise, and no contemporary source actually says is so many words “the library was destroyed on such-and-such a day”. (More details [here](https://www.quora.com/Who-was-responsible-for-the-destruction-of-the-library-of-Alexandria))

The destruction was thorough enough that the Roman historian Aulus Gellius wrote (about 200 years after the fact)

> an enormous quantity of books, nearly seven hundred thousand volumes, was either acquired or written in Egypt under the kings known as Ptolemies; but these were all burned during the sack of the city in our first war with Alexandria, not intentionally or by anyone's order, but accidentally by the auxiliary soldiers

Of course there’s no way to be sure that Gellius somehow knew that every single scroll was incinerated; it’s possible he saying “totally destroyed” the way we might say a city was “wiped out” by bombing in World War 2, when in fact a substantial portion of the city survived.

Given the high monetary value of ancient books, it’s safe to assume that people tried to save individual volumes. In later tradition there are many pieces of scholarly information that are believed to go back to the library in some form — for example the editions of Homer that circulated in Byzantine times were ultimately derived from Alexandrian editions, though there is no way to tell if their manuscript tradition goes back further than the primary burning of the Library by Caesar’s troops or not.

TLDR: there’s no record of any individual book surviving, but the evidence for every single book being lost is not solid. In any event the books that the ancients considered most valuable did not exist as sole copies: the perceived value of a book was directly related to the likelihood it would be copied.
