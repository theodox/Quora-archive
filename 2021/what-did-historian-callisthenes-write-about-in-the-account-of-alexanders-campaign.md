Strictly speaking, we don’t know much: Callisthenes’ work does not survive, except in quotations by later authors.

For the most part we assume that [Arrian ](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/arrian/)and [Plutarch](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/plutarch/) — who are the basis of most of popular accounts of Alexander — got their information from Callisthenes or from another lost history by Alexander’s general and maybe-half-brother who went on to become Ptolemy I of the Egypt.



Callisthenes was (at least, until Alexander had him executed) one of Alexander’s officials, so his version of events was more or less the official one — which would have made it it well informed, which is not the same thing as “trustworthy”.

You can find the tattered remnants of Callisthenes — the ones that survive in quotations by other authors — along with some links to modern scholarship about him in this answer
