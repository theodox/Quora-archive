_“Was declared?”_ “Declared himself” is more correct.

You also don’t want that capital “G”. He quite deliberately specified which god, and in this case he meant [Zeus-Ammon](https://www.liebieghaus.de/en/antike/head-zeus-ammon) — variant of the well known Greek Zeus understood to be a double or alternate identity of the Egyptian solar deity [Amun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amun). This choice of divine parentage was a [carefully calculated and very successful piece of statecraft.](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Alexander-have-to-make-the-long-journey-to-Siwa-which-is-out-of-his-way-to-Persia-How-can-he-know-the-outcome-if-he-just-improvised/answer/Steve-Theodore) However many of the surviving sources also imply that it included more than a touch of megalomania as well, and a lot of modern scholars see it in part as a Freudian echo of Alexander’s extremely dicey relationship with his mortal father.

_Alexander depicted as Zeus-Ammon. The horns come from the traditional Egyptian depiction of who had the head of a Ram. Greek colonists in Libya added a human face to the Egyptian icononography, and this depiction became a common one in Alexander’s empire._

The whole thing was actually less of a stretch of a Greek than it would be in most other times and places. Any Greek aristocrat had a few gods tucked away somewhere in the family Tree.

On Alexander’s fathers’s side, he was an [Argead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argead_dynasty) — the claim, at least, was that they were descended from the royal family of ancient Argos. So, his great-to-the-33rd* grandfather was Herakles, who’s father was Zeus…. And since Herakles’ wife was a daughter of Dionysus, Alexander was also a great-to-the-33rd grandson of the god of Wine. Zeus still gets pride of place, however, because he’s Herakles great-to-the-5th grandfather and thus Alexander’s great-to-the-38th. So it’s not much of a surprise if Zeus shows up again 33 generations later, he’s clearly got the habit.

_Alexander’s family tree, with about a thousand years in the middle omitted_ 

On his mother’s side Alexander claimed descent from Achilles. whose mother was [Thetis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thetis), a daughter of the pre-Olympian sea god [Nereus](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Figures/Nereus/nereus.html#:~:text=Nereus%2C%20also%20known%20as%20%22the,trustworthy%20god%2C%20who%20never%20lied).

But this was not restricted to royalty. Plato’s family, for example, claimed descent from [Codrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codrus), an ancient Athenian king — but Codrus was a great-grandson of Poseidon. The Spartan royal family traced their own heritage back to Heracles (and thus to Zeus) as well.

The Greek fondness for divine ancestry was regarded as a bit funny by other civilizations:

> Hecataeus the historian was once at Thebes, where he made for himself a genealogy which connected him by lineage with a god in the sixteenth generation. But the priests did for him what they did for me (who had not traced my own lineage). They brought me into the great inner court of the temple and showed me there wooden figures which they counted up to the number they had already given, for every high priest sets there in his lifetime a statue of himself; counting and pointing to these, the priests showed me that each inherited from his father; they went through the whole tale of figures, back to the earliest from that of him who had lateliest died. Thus when Hecataeus had traced his descent and claimed that his sixteenth forefather was a god, the priests too traced a line of descent according to the method of their counting; for they would not be persuaded by him that a man could be descended from a god; they traced descent through the whole line of three hundred and forty-five figures, not connecting it with any ancestral god or hero, but declaring each figure to be a "Piromis" the son of a "Piromis," that is, in the Greek language, one who is in all respects a good man.

[Herodotus, II.143](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/2B*.html)

Alexander’s successors generally followed his example — for the next two or three hundred years many Hellenistic kings ruling in the fragments of Alexander’s empire would proclaim themselves related to one god or another. It was a form of political theater which the Romans viewed with amused contempt… until they[ adopted the same habit after the Republic fell and was replaced by the empire](https://www.quora.com/Why-were-Roman-emperors-considered-to-be-gods-or-godlike/answer/Steve-Theodore).



__The generational aspect:__ the conventional Greek date for the Trojan war would be our 1184 BC. Herakles was usually regarded as two generations earlier (as a grown hero, Herakles sailed with Jason and the Argonauts. One of their younger recruits was [Nestor,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestor_(mythology)) who was an old man with a grown son in the _Iliad_ . This would put Herakles about 33 generations (at 25 years per) before Alexander.
