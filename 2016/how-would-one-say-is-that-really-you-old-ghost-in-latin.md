“Is that really you” is _vere, esne tu?._ 

_“Ghost”_ is a bit tricky. For most Romans, a euphemism like [imago ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=imago&la=la&can=imago2&prior=major&d=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=imago&i=5#lexicon)or _[simulacrum](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=s%C4%ADm%C5%ADl%C4%81crum&la=la&can=s%C4%ADm%C5%ADl%C4%81crum0#lexicon)_ _or_ _[spectrum](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=L%C4%95m%C5%ADres&la=la&can=l%C4%95m%C5%ADres0#lexicon)_ _(_ all similar to our ‘apparition’, or ‘vision’) would be the natural choice; the were kind of kind of superstitious in a speak-of-the-Devil sort of way, so literal versions of “ghost” like [lemur ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=L%C4%95m%C5%ADres&la=la&can=l%C4%95m%C5%ADres0#lexicon)would have negative connotations.

If the connotation was respectful, I’d try _vere esne tu, vetus spectrum?_ If a certain level of slanginess was needed, _vere, esne tu, vetus larva?_ might work. _Larva_  is usually one of those words a superstitious Roman would avoid, but Plautus uses it when putting down old men in his comedies.
