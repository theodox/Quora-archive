Theoretically, a full load at an American university is supposed to add up to about 12 hours of class time and 24 hours of out-of-class study per week. However a lot of research suggests that most students actually put in a good bit less than that — more like a 1:1 ratio.

Classics students are likely to skew a bit higher on the time commitment. As an undergraduate, I’d expect something like 12–15 hours a week of sustained attention for the major classes — that’s a mix of language study, reading in translation, and reading secondary sources. I’d expect it to be a bit higher than for some other majors, since classics courses usually have smaller enrollments. This tends to result in a deep engagement in the material — however it also means you probably do need to actually do the reading. It’s easier to skimp on the assignment if you’re nine rows back in a 400 person lecture hall than if you’re one of seven people sitting around a seminar table talking about Sappho.
