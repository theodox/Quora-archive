The sad, fascinating case of British archaeologist [James Melaart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mellaart) is one of the most sophisticated examples of archaeological fraud. Melaart was a well known authority on the archaeology of ancient Asia Minor, but after his death his heirs discovered a remarkable forger’s workshop in Melaart’s studio including draft versions of some of his most famous discoveries. It’s a sad end to what should have been a distinguished career, and the motives behind it remain obscure.
