I remember seeing a Lebbeus Woods book around the office between 2000 and 2002, although I think i belonged to [Greg Coomer](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Greg_Coomer), not Viktor, or maybe to [Ted Backman](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Ted_Backman). I'd be suprised, though, if Viktor never saw it.
