Pretty much so — you can get a textbook like Worthington’s [Complete Babylonian](https://amzn.to/3SuLLSZ) and give it a go.

When I took a class in it I generally noticed that people who were familiar with Hebrew or Arabic found it pretty comprehensible while the rest of us had to work hard to catch up. The grammar is not 100% the same as Arabic or Hebrew but there’s enough familiarity there that it’s not impossible.

The Chicago Assyrian Dictionary — the key reference for Akkadian — is not available in a searchable online format, but a smaller one is available [here](https://www.assyrianlanguages.org/akkadian/use_en.htm).

[The cuneiform writing system is a real challenge](https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-find-an-Akkadian-dictionary-that-has-the-Akkadian-words-in-Cuneiform-instead-of-Latinized/answer/Steve-Theodore?ch=10&oid=359008411&share=1645d1bc&srid=zLvM&target_type=answer) — even Assyriologists tend to decipher and, less often, to compose without cuneiform. However you can compose in ascii text and use software like [Cuneify ](https://cuneify.herokuapp.com/)to turn phonetic Akkadian into somewhat passable cuneiform, although any self-respecting Babylonian or Assyrian scribe would undoubtedly find the results pretty barbarous.

_The start of a line from the code of Hammurabi, “If (szumma) a man (awilum) accused (ubbirma) a man (awilam) ….. “ turned back into cuneiform by the magic of software._
