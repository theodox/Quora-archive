# Is Delphi an island? I saw the word island in the text below. Is there another meaning of the word island? "According to the Ancient Greeks, Delphi was the centre of the world. This island held a temple dedicated to the god Apollo "

__Delphi__ was the center of the world. You can still see the _[omphalos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalos)_ , the stone that supposedly marked the sacred spot.



But Delphi is [on the flank of mount Parnassos in Greece](https://goo.gl/maps/rSDmbAYQPXDBCruk8):

The “island” must be a confusion for __[Delos](https://goo.gl/maps/ZhMCaQuB8TrnYx7i7)__ , the island where Apollo was born — which also held a famous temple of Apollo, though not the oracle.
