_[The original version of this question was about the BBC TV series_ _[Britannia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5932548/)_ _, which features an African actor as what seems to be a Roman legionary in Britain in the year 43. There’s a related answer, more tailored to the show in particular,_ _[here](https://www.quora.com/People-are-complaining-about-the-sight-of-a-black-Roman-legionnaire-in-the-trailer-for-the-new-show-Britannia-Personally-I-imagine-that-black-legionnaires-were-nothing-special-in-a-multicultural-and-multiracial-Roman-army-Who-is-right)_ _]_ 

Roman territory didn’t include a lot of sub-Saharan Africans. Rome’s primary contacts with Africa below the Sahel came through “Nubia” — modern Sudan and Ethiopia. It’s clear from little bits of evidence that people and goods from as far away as Kenya and Senegal ended up in Roman territory, but not in huge numbers. This was a trickle of contact but it didn’t produce a big, concentrated population (lots more detail in [What was the status of black people in the Roman Empire?](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-status-of-black-people-in-the-Roman-Empire) ).

Military units were generally recruited from particular locales; much of what know about them comes from ethnic names of different formations. For the period of the movie we actually have a [pretty complete list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_auxiliaries_in_Britain) of the ethnic units; it suggests that most of the non-Roman units stationed around Hadrian’s wall were recruited in Gaul and Spain. The most identifiable contingent from farther away were [Syrian archers](http://www.romanarmy.net/images/Pages/Military/hamians.htm). So if an African ended up serving in second-century Britain it would be as an individual, not part of a specific ethnic unit.

All that said, it’s not impossible for an individual African to end up somewhere in Britain; the Roman military was highly multicultural. Individuals could also be surprisingly mobile in the ancient world. Just as a random example, here’s an Roman tombstone from near Hadrian’s wall at about the time period of the movie:

The grieving husband who put it up for his British wife is identified as Barates of Palmyra (the bottom line is in Aramaic, written in Palmyrene characters). So this fellow was a far from home as an Ethiopian or Sudanese would have been in second century Britannia.

As for the bigger picture: how you count up blacks in the Roman military overall depends on who you mean by “black.” The Romans recruited heavily in North Africa, particularly among the Numidians of modern Algeria and Tunisia — the ancestors of the modern [Berbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers), who were famous for their skill as light cavalry. The also recruited among the Mauri (“Moors”) of modern Morocco and Mauretania (again, mostly like modern Berbers) for horsemen and light infantry. So, if your definition of “black” extends to the people of the North African shores, then the Roman army was full of blacks — Numidian and Moorish cavalry served all over the empire, from Britain to Mesopotamia, in large numbers.

_Numidian cavalry on Trajan’s column, fighting in the Balkans around 115 AD._ 

The list linked above includes units called the [Alae Afrorum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ala_Afrorum) serving on the Rhine, in the Balkans, in Egypt. These would have been staffed by Numidians or Libyans (another Berber group). The name refers to the Roman province of Africa, roughly modern Tunisia — not what we think of as Africa in English. There were about a dozen North African units in the army around the time of the movie - a nominal strength of around 6,000 men.

If you go with a narrower definition of “black,” the evidence is less clear. There are no known unit names that correspond to Nubia or Ethiopia and no explicit mention of recruitment from those areas. There were regular contingents from the northern Arabian peninsula (modern Jordan) and from southern Egypt, which might easily have included people from farther down the Red Sea. Roman Egypt in particular was a very multicultural place with a mix of native Egyptian, Greek, and Jewish inhabitants. Southern Egypt had longstanding commercial and cultural ties with the neighboring Meroe — it was probably the easiest route for somebody we’d say “looked black” to end up in a Roman legion. Such an outcome would not be particularly surprising since the Persians used African mercenaries from Nubia in their wars against Greece, and the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt had partnered with Nubians in [their war-elephant breeding program](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-historical-fact-you-know-off-the-top-of-your-head/answer/Steve-Theodore) before the Romans came. So it’s not impossible that a Nubian could end up in the Roman army via Egypt.

At the time of the movie the Nubian kingdom of [Meroë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB) on the upper Nile was generally on good terms with the Romans; people and goods moved back and forth into Roman Egypt with some regularity. A century and half later the Romans hired the [Nobatae](http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsAfrica/AfricaSudan.htm) to protect upper Egypt from the nomadic [Blemmyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blemmyes), but these were allies rather than an integrated part of Roman forces. About 400 years _after_  the time period in the movie, Roman armies cooperated with the Ethiopian kingdom of [Axum](https://www.quora.com/Did-Rome-ever-attempt-to-take-over-Axum) against the Persians in Arabia.
