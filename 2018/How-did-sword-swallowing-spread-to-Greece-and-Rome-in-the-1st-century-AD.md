We don’t have very much evidence. The one reference I know of is in Apuleius’ _[The Golden Ass](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/TheGoldenAssI.php)_ _,_ from sometime around the year 160 so that gives a reliable late date*:

> at Athens, not long ago, in front of the Painted Porch, I saw a juggler swallow a sharp-edged cavalry sword with its lethal blade, and later I saw the same fellow, after a little donation, ingest a spear, death-dealing end downwards, right to the depth of his guts: and all of a sudden a beautiful boy swarmed up the wooden bit of the upside-down weapon, where it rose from throat to brow, and danced a dance, all twists and turns, as if he’d no muscle or spine, astounding everyone there.

There’s not much more to go on besides guesswork. It’ totally possible this was a new fad (you can get that impression from the text above), probably spread by the flourishing Roman-Indian trade of the first and second centuries. On the other hand the Romans had a big appetite for entertainment (particularly lowbrow entertainment) going back at least as far as the last century of the Republic. It’s totally possible that exotic acts were circulating much earlier — we know for example, that Roman jugglers and fire-eaters ended up in China (!) around the year 120, well before anything like regular commercial traffic was common.
