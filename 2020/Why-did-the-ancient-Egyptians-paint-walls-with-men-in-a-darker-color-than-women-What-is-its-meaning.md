It’s very common in antiquity, at least around the Mediterranean — it’s not just an Egyptian phenomenon. Generally it’s a status thing: upper class women could live an indoor life, so emphasizing their lighter complexion was a way of indicating their status. The men on the other hand often pursued careers in the military or political realms which kept them out in the sun, so their depictions are often darker or often redder.

For example here’s a fresco from Pompeii:

And here’s one from Crete, more than a thousand years earlier (early in Egypt’s New Kingdom period).

Sometimes the contrasts are quite striking, as in this Greek example from Hatay, in Turkey:

But often they are fairly muted, as in the Etruscan example:

The two-tone scheme is not always a strict gender marker so much as a marker of “indoor living” — in later Greek and Roman examples, children are often depicted in the same light tones as their mothers.

And in some cases you see a mix of colors within a gender — this might be an indication of ethnic origin or it might be part of the indoor/outdoor dichotomy, or it could just be a visual motif — this Etruscan example alternates skin tones quite regularly and seems like it’s chosen for visual rhythm alone — but its also possible that the light-skinned males are supposed to be “boys” as opposed to grown men, or that they are from a different ethnic group (you’ll note they’re dressed differently than the reclining darker skinned males). In a case like this, lacking any supporting texts, we are reduced to guessing.

Like many artistic conventions the indoor/outdoor coloring scheme seems to have been a suggestion, rather than a law: It’s not impossible to find images of the same people that disagree wildly. For example this is a contemporary portrait of Akhenaten and Nefertiti:

But so is this:

As you can see, the convention is clearly optional (and not a good guide to things like, say, the ethnicity of an individual figure).
