Before Antony became prominent in the run-up to Caesar’s civil war, he had knocked around among a variety of populist political circles. He was briefly __a friend and supporter of Cicero’s arch-enemy__ __[Clodius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Clodius_Pulcher)__ , the demagogue who drove the orator into exile. At least by the time Cicero wrote the _[Phillipics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippicae)_ in 44 and 43 BC, he alleged that Antony had been Clodius’s henchman. However our other source, Plutarch, says that Antony was unnerved by Clodius’s violent behavior and did not stay in his circle for long. It’s possible these are both true, but also possible that Cicero’s later statement was an effort to blacken Antony’s name by association with a dead, discredited political gangster.

It certainly didn’t help that Antony eventually (in 47, after Caesar’s takeover) married____ __[Fulvia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulvia)__ , Clodius’s widow and the reigning queen of the extreme populist faction in Roman politics. Fulvia was a Roman [Ma Barker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Barker), a ruthless gang capo who used the remnants of Clodius’s gangs without remorse or hesitation on political enemies and anyone else who got in the way. After Cicero’s death she would prove a dangerous antagonist for Octavian himself, [raising her own legions and even briefly seizing control of Rome itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perusine_War). In the doubtful days following Caesar’s death, it’s easy to see why Cicero would fear the alliance of the widow of his nemesis Clodius and a former lieutenant of Clodius, backed by the same violent gangs which had driven him from his home once before.

So, Antony clearly came from the end of the political spectrum that Cicero loathed. Cicero had a grudging respect for Caesar, despite their radically different politics. Caesar was cultured (Cicero admired his writing) and had demonstrated a willingness to forgive defeated antagonists. His love of power did not translate into greed, and he retained some of the traditional Roman restraint in his personal life.* Antony, on the other hand, was a notorious playboy and loudmouth; even his oratorical style was famous for being overly dramatic and straining for effect. Cicero was a political opponent of both — but he could not respect Antony who (like Clodius) affected the brash manners of a _popularis_  in spite of his blue blood.

Last — but far from least —__Cicero’s feelings about Antony were inseparable from his feelings about the Republic.__ With Caesar’s death the Republic was miraculously revived and the traditional constitution that Cicero saw as the foundation of Roman society was suddenly restored. For a very short time it looked as though the clock had been unwound. However it quickly became clear that Antony aimed at gathering the remnants of Caesar’s tremendous power base into his own hands. If this went unchecked he would clearly assume Caesar’s dominant position too; he had, after all, been Caesar’s second-in-command during the dictatorship. It had been Antony who first toyed with offering Caesar a royal crown. Antony’s credentials as a republican were as flimsy as could be.

During the brief window after Caesar’s death, when the city was directionless and public opinion still mattered more than military force, Cicero saw Antony a s a second, but inferior Caesar. He tried — successfully, for a while — to face down the political gangster with words alone. But[ the days when words ran the Republic were past](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html#2).

> … after Cicero had been butchered, Antony ordered his head to be cut off, and that right hand with which Cicero had written the speeches against him.[2](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html#note24)When they were brought to him, he gazed upon them exultantly, laughing aloud for joy many times; then, when he was sated, he ordered them to be placed on the rostra in the forum, just as though he were putting insult upon the dead, and not rather making a display of his own insolence in good fortune and abuse of power.



* Except, perhaps, for his notorious womanizing. But at least his mistresses were respectable — Antony was prone to cohabiting with actresses.
