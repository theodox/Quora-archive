# A Quoran archaeologist-historian argues there is no textual evidence for a Christian theological tradition in the West prior to the life of Alcuin (735-804 CE), and that earlier Christian history is a fiction. Is there any rigorous counterargument?

The historical method is not a _truth test_ . It’s a set of guidelines for dealing with source material _probabilistically_ .

Especially when dealing with antiquity, historical source criticism deals with _weighting_ , not _vetting;_ source reliability is a scalar, not a binary value. While historians can be verbally lazy, and toss the words “true” and “false” around the way anyone else does, in their professional capacity are primarily interested in establishing _relative probability_  rather than _absolute truth_ .

Ultimately, the practice of history works likes [Bayes’ Theorem](https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/): every statement is evaluated against the balance of probabilities established by the rest. Historians evaluate texts [the way your email provider evaluates spam](http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/). As with email, there are inevitably going to be both false positives and false negatives. The historian’s art is to minimize the chances of both by properly weighting samples.

Thus, the weightings of all the sources are constantly being renegotiated — that’s what’s going on in all those footnotes most people ignore. Citations are easy; arguments about the relative importance of the citations is where the work is. Tightly argued debates about sourcing are why scholarly communications are often so dry. People want stories and drama; professionals argue about ranking, classifying, and sifting sources.

Source handling is an art, not a science. However, like sonnet-writing, it’s an art form with strict rules. There are a range of recognized approaches: extreme empiricists are very reluctant to stray far from the highest quality sources, others are more willing to paper over more of the cracks in the evidentiary records in pursuit of a larger picture. However both camps recognize that the outer extremes of the continuum are not very productive places to operate. Radical skepticism leads to sterility, like those questions which crop up here on Quora [demanding ‘proof’ of the existence of the Roman empire](https://www.quora.com/Lets-say-I-dont-believe-that-modern-day-Rome-is-the-original-ancient-Rome-How-can-one-prove-that-modern-day-Rome-is-the-original-ancient-Rome). Naive acceptance of any particular statement leads to [the fables of Mandeville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mandeville).

So: methodology is a big deal. No practicing historian thinks otherwise. The idea that they are in the business of naively recycling fables is not just wrong, it’s wrongheaded.



The methodology sketched out in the linked question is as far towards the skeptical method as possible. If followed consistently it would render the writing of history for any period before the sixth or seventh century nearly impossible. The author refuses to assign any weight to a text which can’t be attested as a physical object to the period it describes. To overstate things a little (just a little): __there are no Greco-Roman texts which satisfy that criterion before the first century,__ and precious little beyond that.

OK, that’s an oversimplification… a minor one. There are plenty of _fragments_  of familiar works (and a few new discoveries) from Ptolemaic Egypt, which pushes the time horizon back about two and half centuries for individual passages or sections. But — given the standards of evidence that the author of the linked question asserts — fragments must have a very low weighting too. Few of the ‘standard’ classical authors exists in any attested form, even scraps, earlier than the first century — and apart from a few poets, _none_ of them exists in continuous form that early. Typically the cutoff date for complete manuscripts is somewhere between the fifth and the eleventh century.

Here’s a couple of illustrations: The oldest __Livy__  is from the [9th or 10th century](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0159%3Abook%3Dfront%3Achapter%3D2). __Tacitus’s__  _Agricola_  is [the same](http://dcc.dickinson.edu/tacitus-agricola/stuart-intro/manuscripts). __Herodotus__  is quite lucky — the [earliest fragments](http://antiquities.bibalex.org/Collection/Detail.aspx?lang=en&a=559), amounting to a handful of pages from perhaps a dozen finds, are probably first century, in the very first league as far as MS. tradition goes — but still about 500 years after he “lived” and “wrote”. Our oldest continuous Herodotus dates, like so many of the others, [to the 10th C](http://www.antiquorumetpraesentis.com/2014/12/20/from-papyrus-to-codex-from-codex-to-today-a-history-of-the-histories/). __Homer__  does very well, with few scraps and tatters going back all the way to the third century BC, probably the second or third generation of Ptolemaic Egypt. But again, the readable continuous text is only attested from the [ninth century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetus_A): the gap between the version we read in school and the earliest archaeologically verifiable sentences is _more than a millennium wide —_ and that is for the foundational text of all subsequent Greek literature. [I could go on](http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/manuscripts/greek_classics.htm), but I think the point is clear.

You can certainly try to work without any of these texts if your tastes run that way, as long as you are clear and consistent about it. I had a graduate prof whose ideal was _epigraphy or it didn’t happen._ As I remember well, from some rather snippy seminars, that approach is going to erase significant swathes of coherent narrative. It cannot, however, replace what it removes.

Consider the vast bulk of Gibbon’s _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:_ as far as I know there is __nothing__  in his textual sources which can demonstrate a manuscript tradition going back further than the 9th century apart from the Aeneid — for which we have [a lovely 5th century original](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vergilius_Vaticanus). He cites a handful of inscriptions (cadged from [Muratori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_Antonio_Muratori)), but out of the entire work there is scarcely a page which would survive the critical method suggested in this link intact.



The linked article about Eusebius of Caesarea offers an object lesson in the real implications of the author’s methodology. It neatly demonstrates the difference between absolutist binary arguments and actual historiographic practice.

The article argues for the non-existence of Eusebius on the basis that there was no Christian church in the city, and no congregation for him to be part of during his notional lifetime.

The statement that there are no physical remains appears to be correct. However a good Bayesian will observe that this could easily represent a false negative. Out of the countless authors cited by Gibbon, I can think of perhaps four who can be tied to contemporary epigraphy: Augustus, Marcus Aurelius, Tacitus — who served a stint as a provincial governor — and the tendentious poet [Claudian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudian), for whom there was a statue in the Roman forum. For that data set, in other words, lack of epigraphic evidence has a false-negative rate well over 90%. If you excise every Greek or Roman author who left no personal epigraphic trace, every Classics department on earth would shut down the next day.

Perhaps recognizing this, the article immediately moving on to a further claim: that Eusebius’ supposed position as bishop must be factitious because there was no church in existence for him to be part of. This is a repetition of the first claim, although it’s probably a better argument: exactly the sort of argument which ancient historians debate all the time.

However, in this case the claim would be heavily under-weighted by any mainstream historian, since there is a clear mentions of fourth century churches in Caesarea in _[Jerome's Epitaph on Paula](https://books.google.com/books?id=CgzLaNg-Gb4C&lpg=PA220&dq=Epitaphium%20Paulae%20caesarea&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Epitaphium%20Paulae%20caesarea&f=false)_  and an arguable one in [fourth century pilgrim texts](https://www.scribd.com/doc/37368846/The-Itinerarium-Burdigalense-by-The-Anonymous-Pilgrim-of-Bordeaux-333-a-d). The author’s text-skepticism lets him simply ignore these. The lack of physical remains, of course, is subject to future revision: no fourth century church has been found _yet_ ; but clearly that’s a different statement than the claim that the existence of such a church as been_disproved_ . We can leave that to the arbitration of ground-penetrating radar and the shovel.

Thus far we have absence of evidence, to be sure — but not evidence of absence.

However — probably because that’s not a very satisfying resting point — we stray off the strict _via negativa._ The author attempts to expand these two bona-fide holes in the record to make a larger positive claim: that there was no Christian church _of any_ kind for Eusebius to be part of — not just in fourth century Caesarea, but anywhere else.

This is idiosyncratic, particularly for somebody who professes strict adherence to physical evidence. The [Dura-Europos church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura-Europos_church) is (or was, until those ISIS lunatics rampaged through the area in the last few years) a substantial chunk of masonry dated with no ambiguity to the middle of the third century by the coinage found at the site right before its destruction by the Persians. The paintings at the site contain four recognizable New Testament stories (Jesus healing a paralytic man, Jesus and Peter walking on water, Mary waiting at the tomb, and the Samaritan Woman at the well) along with the “Good Shepherd” motif, as well as a baptismal font.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-76b81e8872426e3621fcecc54b31488b)

_Jesus and Peter walking on the water, from the Dura-Europos church._ 

The same site produced several fragments of a Hebrew-language version of the Christian [Didache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didache) and [a Greek text of a Gospel “harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura_Parchment_24)”, necessarily of the same date. So “no Christian church at all” is an argument of little value: certainly, it’s more clearly discounted by positive evidence from Dura than traditional claims about Eusebius are by the negative.

This is a potential impasse. The epigraphy-only method says “no Eusebius,” though it demonstrably produces false negatives with great regularity. The bigger claim is baseless. One can legitimately — if weakly — stick with “no physical evidence for Eusebius” and hope that sways the uncommitted.

What a professional would do at this point is ask, can we use the physical evidence to get a better sense of the reliability of the textual tradition? Can we use it to check the assertion that the tradition is unreliable?

The article wants to exclude texts on the basis of physical chain of custody. In this specific case, however, the textual tradition happens to have a very physical manifestation to consider: the [Madaba Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madaba_Map), a mosiac map of Judaea from 6th-century Jordan. It depicts post-Constantine Jerusalem and other places with biblical history.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7c01088e1212d05c3a0df448e235c81f)

_The Madaba map (542–610) , featuring biblical place names from Eusebius_ 

As far as we can, tell _the primary source for the attributions is the_ _[Onomasticon](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_onomasticon_02_trans.htm)_ _attributed to Eusebius_ : there’s __no other epigraphic or literary source__  which contains them all. The map even reproduces some unusual spellings. A pro will concede this doesn’t “prove” the existence of Eusebius — but it certainly shows that texts attributed to him were literally set in stone by the sixth century. In this connection it would be useful to note that the [Syriac translation of Eusebius in the National Library of St. Peterburg](https://archive.org/details/ecclesiasticalhi00euseuoft) is dated to 452 by a note on the manuscript in a fifth century hand. The manuscript gap for Eusebius does not, as the author claims, reach all the way to the Carolingians; it’s no greater than 250 years at most, and probably more like 100. Does _that_ prove the existence of Eusebius? No. Proof is not the point: relative plausibility is. And this evidence does make the Caesarea archaeology case seem more like the false negative that it is already statistically likely to be.

This is another plausible resting place for the discussion: you can stop here and say “well, we can’t prove the existence of a Eusebius of Caesarea, but the traditions relating to him were circulating in the region within a century or two of his supposed date.” This is not a ringing conclusion, but it’s safe, and sticks within the ostensible guidelines we’re trying to follow. Every classics bookshelf contains hundreds of statements just like this.

Still, if you were interested in using this as a test case for the validity of the prevalent textual tradition there are some interesting arguments to consider. There’s plenty of (non-theological) data in the textual stream about the physical geography of fourth century Judea. You could try to use that as a control on the reliability of texts like the Jerome’s _Epitaphium_ , Sozomen, Socrates Scholasticus or Eusebius’ own works as they relate to the region, and then use that to gauge whether to accept the several reports of churches in Caesarea. In that context I’d mention that the archaeology relating to the pilgrim itineraries and Constantine’s building program in Jerusalem has been studied for more than a century without major falsifications — and, just recently, [chemical tests confirmed the date of the mortar used in the vault of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre dates to the mid 4th century](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/jesus-tomb-archaeology-jerusalem-christianity-rome/) - exactly when Sozomen, Scholasticus, Jerome and Eusebius would tell us to expect it. The details of all this material is probably where a mainstream scholar would get busy.

However, that is emphatically not what happens here. The instead article claims unequivocally that the textual tradition around Eusebius is an interpolation or forgery, perpetrated at some point between the 330s and the 8th century.

This is emphatically an _affirmative_ claim, not a null hypothesis.

That claim is not supported by any positive evidence — certainly not by any evidence that passes the test being proposed in the article. Where is the epigraphy or archaeology supporting a college of forgers, creating or altering the several million words of the Greek, Latin, Syriac and Coptic traditions which the author wants to discredit? What’s the medium by which these medieval French and German monks managed to translate their their texts into Syriac, Coptic, Armenian, Persian, Gothic, Bulgarian, and Ge’ez ?

This does not even need to be a critique of the plausibility of such a huge, audacious claim: it’s simply pointing out that it fails the test the article trumpets as the gold standard of evidence.

It’s one thing to claim strict adherence to the most rigorous standards of proof. It’s quite another thing to claim them only when it’s convenient.
