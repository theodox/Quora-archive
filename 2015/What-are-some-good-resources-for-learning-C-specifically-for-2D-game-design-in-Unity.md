I haven't read it myself but a friend is working his way through [Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development: From Concept to Playable Game with Unity and C#](http://amzn.to/1JG79OD) and likes it. 

[C# Game Programming Cookboo for Unity](http://amzn.to/1dxBH7u) might not be the best _first_ book, but it's useful if you already know enough to get started and would like some pointers on specific common problems
