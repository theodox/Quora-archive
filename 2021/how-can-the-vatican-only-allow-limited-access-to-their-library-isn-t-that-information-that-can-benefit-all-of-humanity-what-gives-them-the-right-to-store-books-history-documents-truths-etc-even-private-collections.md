# How can the Vatican only allow limited access to their library? Isn’t that information that can benefit all of humanity? What gives them the right to store books, history, documents, truths, etc? Even private collections get displayed publicly…

If you’re really interested in the contents of the Vatican library, you’ll be pleased to know that much of its unique material is already available for free online:



The process is painstaking and delicate so it doesn’t happen overnight, but has been going on for years and will be for quite some time. The project was originally supposed to run from about 2010 to 2025 — with the events of the last few years, they’re running behind schedule. However eventually everything will be available digitally for free.

The catalogs, incidentally, are public — you can order photographic reproductions of printed material that’s not yet digitized here:



If you want to know why access is so restricted: well, here’s something on the “unavailable” list:

It’s in pretty rough shape and extremely delicate. Time is not kind to books…. and this is from the fourteenth century — it’s _a thousand years newer_ than the rarest and most precious items in the library. These texts are both irreplaceable and incredibly fragile, they have to stored and handled with great care at all times: that’s why the digitization takes so long.
