The last native Egyptian Pharoah is [Nectanebo II, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectanebo_II)who was the last ruler of the short lived 30th Dynasty.

The Persians conquered Egypt originally in 525 BC, but were driven out by the rebel Pharoah [Amyrtaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyrtaeus) in 404 BC. The Persians returned in 343 and drove Nectanebo into exile in 342; we don’t know what happened to him after that. Alexander the Great conquered Persian Egypt in 332 BC; eventually the kingdom passed into the control of his General [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter), whose family ran the country until the Cleopatra lost her kingdom the Romans in 27 BC. Cleopatra wasn’t a native Egyptian (see [Was the last Pharaoh of Egypt called Cleopatra and who were her parents?](https://www.quora.com/Was-the-last-Pharaoh-of-Egypt-called-Cleopatra-and-who-were-her-parents))

Nectanebo’s legacy did however live on : He became a kind of King Arthur figure in Egyptian eyes, and a nationalist legend that he was Alexander’s real father was widely believed in ancient times.
