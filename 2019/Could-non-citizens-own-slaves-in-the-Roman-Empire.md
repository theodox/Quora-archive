Yes.

Roman law explicitly saw the existence of slavery as a part of the _ius gentium,_ the “law of the nations” — [their understanding of international law:](http://thelatinlibrary.com/law/institutes.html)

> The law of the nations is common to all mankind, for nations have established certain laws, as occasion and the necessities of human life required. Wars arose, and in their train followed captivity and then slavery, which is contrary to the law of nature; for by that law all men are originally born free. Further, by the law of nations almost all contracts were at first introduced, as, for instance, buying and selling, letting and hiring, partnership, deposits, loans returnable in kind, and very many others.

Until 212, most of the free population of the empire were _[peregrini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrinus_(Roman))_ _, “_ foreigners.” They didn’t have the same political rights as Roman citizens, and they had a weaker position if they ended up in a legal conflict with a Roman citizen or the Roman state. However they were (at least in theory) protected by the _ius gentium,_ reciprocal respect for the common institutions of mankind. Peregrini could make contracts, be secure in their persons and their property — and own slaves.

This sounds strange to modern ears, of course, but the Romans never encountered a society which didn’t practice slavery — they recognized slavery as being “contrary to nature” but they also saw that it was a universal practice among their contemporaries which they protected as part of the general principles of “civilized” respect for foreigners.
