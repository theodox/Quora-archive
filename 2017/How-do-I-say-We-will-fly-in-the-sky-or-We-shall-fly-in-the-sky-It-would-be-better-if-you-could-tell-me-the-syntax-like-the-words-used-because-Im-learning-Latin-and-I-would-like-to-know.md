# How do I say "We will fly in the sky" or "We shall fly in the sky"? It would be better if you could tell me the syntax (like the words used), because I'm learning Latin and I would like to know.

Latin doesn’t have an exact match for the English “shall”. Most often you use the future tense, so _volabimus in caelo_ (or _in caelo volabimus_ , word order doesn’t matter) covers both “we will fly” and “we shall fly”.
