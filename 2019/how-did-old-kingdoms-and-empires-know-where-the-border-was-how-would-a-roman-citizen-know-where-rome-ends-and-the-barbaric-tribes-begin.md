In some places you could walk for days and not realize you’d crossed some kind of line. In others, it would have been obvious exactly where the line between “them” and “us” lay.

The Roman state was vitally concerned with deterring attacks, suppressing banditry, and extracting taxes from cross-border trade. This did not always mean there was an obvious physical barrier, however, since large stretches of the Roman world fronted on thinly populated and inhospitable places. In dangerous regions there were fixed fortifications — Hadrian’s wall in Scotland is the most famous example — but in many places the “border” was simply the first city along your route. The Roman world was essentially _an archipelago of cities:_ you could not travel far within the empire without passing through a city, probably walled, where your passage would be observed and you’d be liable for customs duties.

Until around the end of the third century, you’d probably have more hassles with local laws and customs than with the “imperial” presence unless you crossed at a fortified stronghold. In most of the empire day-to-day life was policed (to the degree that it was — vastly less than we are used to) by local authorities. In a city these will have been locally elected magistrates but in more rural places it would probably be a powerful local landowner with a troop of armed retainers. Military troops and imperial officers were fairly thin on the ground, and tended to cluster in places of political or strategic importance. If you crossed the border in a fashion that made local officials nervous, however, you might be detained until the provincial governor could send an officer to make a decision about you.

__“open borders”__ 

In thinly populated places where there was little trade, there might be little or no visible sign of the transition at all.

For example, the southern boundary of the empire — which looks like a neat colored region on a modern map — was for the most part just the Sahara desert. Policing such a vast, empty, and unprofitable space was not worth the effort. This Roman “border” on a modern map stretched from the Atlantic to the Western Desert of Egypt, then turned south to the Gabal El Uweinat — a ‘frontier’ of over 3,000 miles. However only a small portion of it, only around 500 miles was marked by a visible frontier. The temptingly prosperous agricultural regions of Tunisia were protected by the [Fossatum Africae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossatum_Africae), a line of small fortifications intended to prevent raids by nomadic peoples living farther inland. However as far as we know most of that long stretch of the Saharan frontier was simply empty space. The need for water and shelter was going to oblige anyone the Romans cared about to present themselves at a city gate somewhere.

__Southern and Eastern borders__ 

However, in regions where where high-value trade was common Roman officialdom was out in force. The lucrative [Indian Ocean sea trade,](https://www.quora.com/I-have-heard-that-ancient-Greece-and-Rome-were-having-trades-with-south-Indian-kingdoms-But-in-history-why-werent-these-given-much-importance-and-not-talked-about?ch=10&share=5752e0e7&srid=zLvM) which passed through the Red Sea ports of Arsinoe, Berenice and Myos Hormos, was taxed at a swingeing 25% and was enforced by a small army of customs officials and coast guards. Since the taxes were paid in kind, imported goods were trans-shipped under guard to Alexandria to be stored in bonded warehouses where the government took its cut. Bonds were required at landing (we actually have a few examples of the paperwork required) and the penalties for smuggling were severe. These import taxes, the _portoria_ , were a significant fraction of the imperial budget and the government was pretty ruthless in exacting its cut. The lack of alternative harbors and roads made policing this route relatively easy.

On the eastern edge of the empire, where the “Silk Road” of antiquity entered Roman territory in Syria, there was something very much like a modern border. Most of the time the Roman frontier lay along the line of the upper Euphrates, with heavily fortified border crossings observed by large military garrisons because of the threat from the Persia to the east. Caravans going both ways were limited to a small number of routes, since there were mountains to the north and deserts to the south. Both Roman and Persian governments were diligent in taxing the merchants who passed back and forth. There was also a constant low-grade game of espionage along this highly militarized and conflict-ridden frontier.

__Europe__ 

Along the European frontiers, security rather than trade was the most important concern. Until about the end of the third century the Roman frontier was lightly fortified by a chain of observation posts and fortlets. These were not intended any kind of ‘great wall of Rome’ but rather meant to slow down a raiding party or an invading force and allow time for a mobile army to gather for a counterattack. As barbarian pressure built up during the fourth and fifth centuries the Romans pulled their borders back to strong natural defenses, particularly along the Rhine and the Danube; the borders became more heavily encrusted with fortifications to help economize on the over-stretched Roman military. However the goal was still the same: to buy time for a field army to assemble, not to provide a hermetic seal around Roman territory.

Trade in Europe was less lucrative than the thriving trade with the orient, but the Roman government still wanted its cut. The same rivers lines and the observation posts along the frontier which kept an eye on raiders also canalized cross-border trade into a manageable number of crossings which could be monitored and taxed. The _portoria_ duties in Gaul were much lower than those in Egypt and Syria (2.5% rather than 25%!) but they were still exacted. Since overland trade within the empire was ultimately managed from city to city, merchants would eventually have fetched up somewhere with an administrator who’d expect to see proof that they’d paid the _portoria_ or risk having their good confiscated. The Romans maintained a[ fleet of galleys on the Rhine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classis_Germanica#1st_to_2nd_century), partly for defense but also to keep down river piracy and keep an eye out for smugglers.

__Client states and buffer zones__ 

It’s worth pointing out that the Romans made a point of surrounding their own territory, wherever possible, with friendly client states. It was easier and cheaper to subsidize the royal family of a border state like Commagene or Mauretania or Judaea than to establish a fortified military frontier. Roman residents and diplomats ‘over the border’ provided intelligence and early warnings about possible trouble. Allied governments helped — in theory, anyway — to suppress bandits and smugglers. Even stereotypically “barbarous” places like the Rhineland or the Balkans were usually managed with a mix of diplomacy, bribery and coercion applied to local rulers rather than internal security forces.

There were some places where the people on the other side of the border were so hostile or simply so heterogeneous that there was no easy way to control them through diplomatic means. In places like that you’d see constant low-grade skirmishing and raiding, usually supported by the typical Roman mix of fortified observation posts and strong points. Hadrian’s wall is a good example of this situation.

When something bad did happen across one of these fuzzy “borders” the typical Roman response would be to demand the surrender of the culprits or to launch a punitive raid. On occassion these local conflicts spilled out of control into full-scale campaigns: this was how the Romans acquired many of their possessions in Illyria, and why they briefly occupied Garama deep in the Sahara. But, after around the first century the Romans were pretty disciplined about not grabbing territory which was too expensive to police just for the sake of square footage. Burning a few villages and taking a few slaves to let the “barbarians” know who was boss was cheaper than trying to occupy an otherwise unprofitable backwater.

__Pre-modern border control__ 

It’s always worth remembering that travel in the ancient world was difficult, particularly if you were not part an elite social group with connections outside your home region. The modern world, where people can cross large distances and set up new lives for themselves half way around the globe, is a huge anomaly. Ancient states did not have to work very hard at policing borders because most folks were land-bound peasants or slaves, and the majority of free people never dared to try tourism or emigration.

We know of no passport control or visa system, though a stranger appearing out of nowhere could very well be detained on suspicion by a local official in times of conflict or if there were reason to suspect him of being an escaped slave. “Immigration control” was only a sporadic problem, and it typically involved an entire people on the move at one time — for example, when the [Thervingi Goths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritigern) wanted to cross into Roman territory to escape from the Huns. Typically the Romans were willing to accommodate that kind of mass immigration if they believed the newcomers would prove to be useful auxiliary soldiers (the Gothic episode ended badly for both sides, but it was a botched version of a relatively standard Roman tactic). However this was anything but routine: a barbarian nation showing up on the border and demanding admittance was going to be met by a Roman army and obliged to negotiate terms.

At the individual end of the spectrum, in most of the empire an individual or a small group could wander in and out of Roman territory at will — provided, of course, that they had enough money to make their way and were adept at staying out of trouble. Roman citizens — before 212, a distinct minority of Roman subjects — had special rights and privileges, but the authoritative proof of citizen status was really the network of family and clan relationships which established one’s identity. Only people who were routinely far from home, like soldiers or merchants, carried proof of their citizen status with them, primarily in order to assert their citizen rights if they ran into trouble with a local official.

In theory everyone else (even a Roman provincial) was a _peregrinus_ , a foreigner. As such they were theoretically protected by the _ius gentium_ , the “law of nations” which guaranteed their freedom from violence and the security of their property. In practice of course, real foreigners had to beware of running afoul of powerful locals and corrupt officials. It would be very easy for an individual with no friends or patrons to be abused with impunity. In places with regular cross-border traffic, a newcomer would probably want to make contact with a resident member of their own nation, a _[hospes](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Hospitium.html)_ __ (what we’d call a “foreign consul”) who could provide help and advocacy in the event of trouble. Otherwise, money and guile would be critical survival tools.
