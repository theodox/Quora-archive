This Greek-looking inscription is actually one of the oldest known examples of written Latin, from the [Lapis Niger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_Niger) in Rome. 

As [Mitali Mehta](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mitali-Mehta-2) notes they got their alphabet through the Etruscans, who exchanged goods and ideas with the Greeks; the Etruscan alphabet seems to be derived from contact with the Greek city of [Cumae, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumae) probably in the 7th century BC.

This Greek-looking inscription is actually one of the oldest known examples of written Latin, from the [Lapis Niger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_Niger) in Rome. It mentions the sacrificial duties of a king, so it's older than the Roman Republic and must pre-date 550 BC.

As for language: the Romans were never conquered or colonized by the Greeks -- although there were several Greek cities in southern Italy and Sicily none of them every really dominated the Italian peninsula -- the Greeks were most confined to coastal enclaves and were always outnumber by different Italic peoples. Latin is closer to other Italic languages like Oscan, Umbrian and Sabine. So the Romans didn't have a big incentive to use the language for trade or diplomacy -- their immediate neighbors and rivals spoke a language very similar to their own. 

By contrast he spread of Greek in the Middle East happened during the long period when Greek states dominated the area. Greek was a common language for traders and statesmen from Egypt to India under the Ptolemies and Seleucids because it was a useful way for the hundreds of different language groups to communicate (Aramaic played the same role under the Persians, and Arabic eventually replace Greek as the common language of the region). Since Rome was never dominated by a large outside power ordinary Romans didn't have the same incentive to learn another language. However as Rome absorbed the Greek world wealthier Romans generally did learn Greek -- by the end of the Republic, knowledge of Greek was pretty much expected for any educated Roman even if only a minority of them were fluent.
