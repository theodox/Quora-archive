There were quite a few. From the second through the fourth centuries, the Roman army of the Danube was headquartered at [Sirmium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirmium) (modern [Sremska Mitrovica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sremska_Mitrovica)) and so many military families grew up around that area. Since the endemic civil wars of the third century ended with many soldiers on the throne -- unfortunately for an average reign of about 2 years each -- the so -called [Illyrian emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrian_emperors) are very numerous but most are not particularly famous. 

__The historically significant ones__ 


[Claudius Gothicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius_Gothicus), who defeated a massive Gothic invasion at[ Naissus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Naissus) ([Niš](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C5%A1)) in 269.

[Aurelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian), who re-united the empire in 273 when it had dissolved into 3 warring parts.

[Constantine the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great), founder of Constantinople and also the first Roman emperor to legalize Christianity. Born in [Niš](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C5%A1)
