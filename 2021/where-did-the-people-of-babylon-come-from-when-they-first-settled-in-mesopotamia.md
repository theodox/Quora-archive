Babylon became a significant settlement under the [Amorites](https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium.MAGAZINE-the-legend-of-the-amorites-1.5493696), although there’s no reason to assume the population was wholly or even mostly of Amorite origin. Most of the population descended from the pre-existing mixed Akkadian-Sumerian population of Mesopotamia.

The Amorites seem to have originated as nomads based in what’s now northwestern Syria. The agricultural peoples of Mesopotamia didn’t approve of their “uncivilized” ways :

> The MAR.TU [=”westerners”] who know no grain.... The MAR.TU who know no house nor town, the boors of the mountains.... The MAR.TU who digs up truffles... who does not bend his knees (to cultivate the land), who eats raw meat, who has no house during his lifetime, who is not buried after death

The name “Amorites” may derive from _aburru, “pasture”;_ variants of _Amurru_  were how their neighbors in Mesopotamia and Egypt referred to them.

Amorites spoke a language from the northwest Semitic family, related to Hebrew and Phoenician . The Akkadian population of Mesopotamia spoke an east-Semitic language — also related, but more distantly, and with no living descendants.

The mobile Amorites took advantage of the weakening of the [last Sumerian dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Dynasty_of_Ur), establishing kingdoms in a number of cities in Mesopotamia in the 20th - 17th centuries BC. Babylon was one of the cities that got an Amorite ruling class, but it was not one of the larger or more important ones when the Amorites arrived. The settlement actually formed around 2300 BC (so, several centuries before the Amorites came) as an insignificant market town in the [Akkadian Empire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire)

As often happened in antiquity, [nomads had better mobility and superior military potential than settled people](https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-people-of-the-Asian-Steppe-overthrow-so-many-empires/answer/Steve-Theodore). But they typically had lower population density — which is why “Amorite” Babylon was probably populated for the most part by the mixed Sumerian and Akkadian population that had been in the region for preceding millennium.

_On this map (~ 1750 BC) Babylon,_ _[Mari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari,_Syria)_ _,_ _[Yamhad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamhad)_ _,_ _[Qatna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatna)_ _and_ _[Amurru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amurru_kingdom)_ _(uncolored, west of Qatna) were all ruled by Amorite or Amorite-related dynasties. The original Amorite homeland is thought to have been at the juncture of the three kingdoms of Yamhad, Qatna and Mari._ 

Despite it’s Amorite ruling class, Babylon was primarily an Akkadian speaking society. We have a great amount of literary material from Amorite Babylon (and other Amorite kingdoms of the same period, such as [Mari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari,_Syria#The_Lim_dynasty)) but it’s written in Akkadian; most of what we know about Amorite itself is based on personal names or other nouns that show up in Akkadian documents.

Later on another group, the [Kassites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassites), would end up controlling Babylon after the last Amorite king was defeated by the Hittite Empire ([probably around 1600 BC, but there are significant disagreements about the dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia#The_sack_of_Babylon_and_ancient_Near_East_chronology)). There would be further changes at the top over the next millennium: Assyrians from northern Mesopotamia, Aramaeans from Syria, and eventually the Chaldaeans again from Syria — the last two groups repeating the nomad-conquest pattern of the Amorites.

Despite all that, the tremendous commercial vitality of the city meant that it was always the crossroads of Mesopotamia. Changes of language and rulers notwithstanding, Babylon was always a running average of Near Eastern society, not a homogenous ethno-state.



The Amorites also [show up in the Bible, most often as enemies of the Hebrews](https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium.MAGAZINE-the-legend-of-the-amorites-1.5493696) in the However it’s not clear that these are really the same people; the reference is several hundred years after the rise and fall of Amorite Babylon, and the name may have morphed into a generic term for “barbarians,” — moreover the Biblical references are some hundreds of years later than the events they describe as well.

In the 19th century some European scholars argued that the Amorites — described in the Bible as gigantic, “whose height was like the height of cedars” — were actually Indo-Europeans because of their stature. Nowadays that’s not taken seriously.
