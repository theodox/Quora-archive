Daughter is more usually going to be θυγάτηρ if you’re talking about family relationships. κόρη is more like “girl” or “maiden” or sometimes “virgin”.

The are examples where Kore can be translated as “daughter” from context but — like “girl” — it’s a broader word. In later texts it’s often the counterpart of παῖς, “boy” and both are euphemisms for “slave.”

If the context is specifically cultic, it might be confusing because in religious usages κόρη, “The Maiden,” was the common epithet for [Persephone](https://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Persephone.html).

PS: Just in case you’re thinking of a tattoo, you might want to read up on the myth of [Harmonia](https://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/Harmonia.html), who really was the daughter of Aphrodite (and Ares) before you go under the needle!

Ζεὺς [δὲ] ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ γυναῖκα Ἁρμονίαν, Ἀφροδίτης καὶ Ἄρεος θυγατέρα.
“Zeus gave him [=Cadmus] as a wife Harmonia, daughter of Aphrodite and Ares”
