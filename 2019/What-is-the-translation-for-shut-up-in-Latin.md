You’d say _tace_ , literally “be silent!”. There’s an odd trace of this fact in the obscure English phrae _[Tace is Latin for candlestick](https://wordhistories.net/2017/04/22/tace-is-latin-for-candle/)_ _,_ whose origins are very unclear but was clearly used as a way to encourage people to keep silent.
