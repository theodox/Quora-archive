The closest we have to a comprehensive list comes from Plutarch’s description of Cleopatra, who (unusually for members of her family) actually made an effort to learn the languages of her subjects.

> There was sweetness also in the tones of her voice; and her tongue, like an instrument of many strings, she could readily turn to whatever language she pleased, so that in her interviews with Barbarians she very seldom had need of an interpreter, but made her replies to most of them herself and unassisted, whether they were__Ethiopians, Troglodytes, Hebrews, Arabians, Syrians, Medes or Parthians__ . Nay, it is said that she knew the speech of many other peoples also, although the kings of Egypt before her had not even made an effort to learn the native language, and some actually gave up their Macedonian dialect.

Etthiopian is Kushite, the language kingdom of Meroe in modern Sudan; we’d also call it Nubian.

Troglodytes were the cave-dwelling peoples of the desert outskirts of Egypt, particularly along the Red Sea; we think their language was part of the Berber family.

Egyptian jews— a significant community in Egypt — spoke Hebrew.

Arabians — in this context, primarily people from either [Nabataea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabataeans) or [Arabia Felix ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabia_Felix)— spoke a mix of Aramaic and Arabic: probably the list means the latter.

Syrians probably includes all Levantines. They spoke Aramaic.

Parthians spoke Parthian, rather than Persian; since the list distinguishes Medes from Parthians, it implies that they spoke Median, which is fairly close to Old Persian.

Missing from the list is Greek, of course, and Libyan — the eastern Berber language which was spoken in the western territories of Egypt.
