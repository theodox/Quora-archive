[Tim O'Neill](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-ONeill-1)'s answer covers the basics: this was intercommunal violence in a city with a long and unpleasant history of riots between a number of different communities. 

Alexandria was big, poorly policed multi-ethnic city, governed by a mostly foreign elite which was frequently happy to play off different groups against one another. This started with Alexander himself, who imported large numbers of foreigners, particularly but not only Greek and Jewish, as a counterweight to the native Egyptians. The city saw serious violence between different coalitions among these three groups on a pretty regular basis: the most infamous examples were big conflicts in 38 and 66, followed by the near complete extermination of the Jewish community in Alexandria between 115 and 135. Egyptians also revolted against their Greco-Roman rulers during the brief rise of Palmyra in the 270's. In the 300's Alexandrian riots had driven out several unpopular Imperial appointees, both pagan and Christian. This particular mob outbreak was sadly not unusual, except for the press it has gotten since.
